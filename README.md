# Welcome to Arman Behnam Courses repository

Here are some courses that I've shared with U to help broaden our knowledge.
Courses are categorized into four parts: [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks), [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/), [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/), [Interdisciplinary schools](https://github.com/ArmanBehnam/Courses/tree/master/Interdisciplinary%20schools%20-%20Neuroscience)
