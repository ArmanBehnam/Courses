    "# The Goal of Feature Engineering #\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of feature engineering is simply to make your data better suited to the problem at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider \"apparent temperature\" measures like the heat index and the wind chill. These quantities attempt to measure the *perceived* temperature to humans based on air temperature, humidity, and wind speed, things which we can measure directly. You could think of an apparent temperature as the result of a kind of feature engineering, an attempt to make the observed data more relevant to what we actually care about: how it actually feels outside!\n",
    "\n",
    "You might perform feature engineering to:\n",
    "- improve a model's predictive performance\n",
    "- reduce computational or data needs\n",
    "- improve interpretability of the results\n",
    "\n",
    "# A Guiding Principle of Feature Engineering #\n",
    "\n",
    "For a feature to be useful, it must have a relationship to the target that your model is able to learn. Linear models, for instance, are only able to learn linear relationships. So, when using a linear model, your goal is to transform the features to make their relationship to the target linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea here is that a transformation you apply to a feature becomes in essence a part of the model itself. Say you were trying to predict the `Price` of square plots of land from the `Length` of one side. Fitting a linear model directly to `Length` gives poor results: the relationship is not linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure style=\"padding: 1em;\">\n",
    "<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/5D1z24N.png\" width=300, alt=\"A scatterplot of Length along the x-axis and Price along the y-axis, the points increasing in a curve, with a poorly-fitting line superimposed.\">\n",
    "<figcaption style=\"textalign: center; font-style: italic\"><center>A linear model fits poorly with only Length as feature.\n",
    "</center></figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "If we square the `Length` feature to get `'Area'`, however, we create a linear relationship. Adding `Area` to the feature set means this linear model can now fit a parabola. Squaring a feature, in other words, gave the linear model the ability to fit squared features.\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure style=\"padding: 1em;\">\n",
    "<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/BLRsYOK.png\" width=600, alt=\"Left: Area now on the x-axis. The points increasing in a linear shape, with a well-fitting line superimposed. Right: Length on the x-axis now. The points increase in a curve as before, and a well-fitting curve is superimposed.\">\n",
    "<figcaption style=\"textalign: center; font-style: italic\"><center><strong>Left:</strong> The fit to Area is much better. <strong>Right:</strong> Which makes the fit to Length better as well.\n",
    "</center></figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "This should show you why there can be such a high return on time invested in feature engineering. Whatever relationships your model can't learn, you can provide yourself through transformations. As you develop your feature set, think about what information your model could use to achieve its best performance."
