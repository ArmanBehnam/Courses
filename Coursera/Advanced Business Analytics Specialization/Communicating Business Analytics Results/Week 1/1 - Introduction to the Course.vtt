00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.030
Welcome to the fourth course
of data analytic for business.

2
00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:06.630
In the first course of the specialization,

3
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:11.580
they've covered how analytic problems
emerge in an information life

4
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.410
cycle that begins with events in the real
world and ends with business actions.

5
00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:23.930
In his course, you also learned about
technologies that enable analytical work.

6
00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.190
You examine data storage and

7
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:31.200
data basis, along with big data and
cloud technologies.

8
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.730
And then in the second course,

9
00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.720
walk you through explanatory data
analysis and prediction models.

10
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.980
In the third course, you and

11
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.430
I made a transition from predictive
analytics to prescriptive analytics.

12
00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.340
You learn about capturing
uncertainty through simulation,

13
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.085
and you also learn about
building optimization models.

14
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.600
These three courses have given you
a solid foundation of data analytics for

15
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.920
business problems.

16
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.650
Obviously, the topics
that we have covered so

17
00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:06.630
far could be explored at the greater
detail, which by the way that's exactly

18
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.120
what we do hear at the Leeds School in our
Master's Program in Business Analytics.

19
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.250
So you might want to think about
coming to Boulder for a year.

20
00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.960
Anyway, at this point you do
have an overall understanding

21
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.560
of how analytical organizations use data.

22
00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.470
You also know about the main techniques
and models for data analytics.

23
00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:35.796
However, all the knowledge and the hard
work of doing analysis to gain insights,

24
00:01:35.796 --> 00:01:40.207
are not enough to produce
actionable items and results.

25
00:01:40.207 --> 00:01:44.845
The missing piece of the puzzle
is effective communication, and

26
00:01:44.845 --> 00:01:49.917
this is what Dave, Dan and I are going
to discuss in this fourth course.

27
00:01:49.917 --> 00:01:55.575
Tables and graphs are the main vehicles
communicate quantitative information.

28
00:01:55.575 --> 00:02:01.221
However, few of those individuals making
presentations or writing documents,

29
00:02:01.221 --> 00:02:06.394
have ever taken a formal course on
designing effective tables and graphs.

30
00:02:06.394 --> 00:02:08.498
When should a table be used?

31
00:02:08.498 --> 00:02:10.820
When should a graph be used?

32
00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.440
If a graph is used,
which type of graph should it be?

33
00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.266
So as part of this course,

34
00:02:17.266 --> 00:02:22.269
we will discuss simple guidelines that
will help you make these decisions.

35
00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:27.929
If you Google data visualization you
will get almost 30 million webpages.

36
00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.510
Data visualization tools have become
very popular because of their

37
00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.710
power to communicate quantitative
information through visual perception.

38
00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:41.290
A single well designed graph

39
00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.920
is able to communicate an incredibly
large amount of information.

40
00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.410
Graphs are particularly helpful when
you're trying to communicate patterns,

41
00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:51.930
trends or receptions.

42
00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.050
They are also effective when
comparing several series of values.

43
00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.770
Data visualization is definitely great,
but

44
00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:05.800
there are things that you need to avoid
and you will learn about them here.

45
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:06.700
The end of the day,

46
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:12.140
communicating analytical resource is
about telling a story, with numbers.

47
00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.186
Tables and graphs are instruments,
but they're not the story.

48
00:03:16.186 --> 00:03:21.587
Your facts and findings are the story,
and you need to communicate them well.

49
00:03:21.587 --> 00:03:25.710
Effective communication,
it starts with knowing your audience.

50
00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:31.170
Then, you also need to know general
principles of effective storytelling.

51
00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.760
I am glad that you have made it to
this point of our specialization.

52
00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.170
Dave, Dan and

53
00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:42.510
I work really hard on creating
a comprehensive view of data analytics.

54
00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.100
What you experience in
the first three courses, and

55
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:50.280
what you will experience in this one
is the result of a coordinated effort.

56
00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.910
We did not want to just each
of us do our own thing.

57
00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:59.220
This is our collective view of
data analytics in the context of

58
00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.930
business problems and decision making.
