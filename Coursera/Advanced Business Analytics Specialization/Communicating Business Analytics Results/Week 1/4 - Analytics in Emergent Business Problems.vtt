00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.050
In an earlier video we learned about some
of the classic business problems that can

2
00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:06.320
be solved using data analytics.

3
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.640
Our objective was to start shifting
our focus from analytic methods

4
00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.040
back to the business context and

5
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.190
the issues that are driving our
analytic process as a whole.

6
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.745
We can then start thinking about all the
things we need to do after our analysis

7
00:00:17.745 --> 00:00:20.890
is complete,
to drive action in a market place.

8
00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.770
In this video we're going to spend
just a little time rounding out our

9
00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:27.710
perspective by looking at some emerging
problems that have stimulated new types of

10
00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.115
analytical methods and solutions.

11
00:00:29.115 --> 00:00:33.150
Mainly areas involving the web,
mobile, and social media.

12
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.310
Unless you've been hiding under a rock
somewhere these technologies probably need

13
00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:37.430
no introduction.

14
00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.730
But just in case let's outline
exactly what we're talking about.

15
00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.700
When we say the web, we're talking about
how people navigate and use the Internet.

16
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.340
More specifically, we're often focused
on how organizations interact with their

17
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.320
users or customers' via website.

18
00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.830
With Mobile,
we consider where people are and

19
00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.488
what they are doing by focusing in
the presence and usage of mobile devices.

20
00:00:57.488 --> 00:01:00.340
Whether they be mobile phone,
tablets, laptops or

21
00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.220
other connected devices
that can move with a user.

22
00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.160
We can actually expand this a little to
include objects that are connected to

23
00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.200
mobile networks.

24
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.210
Whether they be mobile like a car or truck
or not like the water meter at your house.

25
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.610
Social media speaks to
how people interact and

26
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.440
share information with each other
in an online connected environment.

27
00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.430
This is actually a pretty broad concept
which incorporates a number of ideas,

28
00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.750
as illustrated in this nice figure
from Brian Solis and JESS3.

29
00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.990
In our discussion, we'll focus on
a couple of aspects of social.

30
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.120
Namely, how organizations look
at what users communicate and

31
00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.460
how users are connected to each other.

32
00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.830
Okay, now that we have the basics defined,

33
00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.980
let's outline some of the business
issues associated with each area.

34
00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.410
And how we use analytics
to address those issues.

35
00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.050
Let's start with the web.

36
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:47.840
Just about all organizations have one or

37
00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.620
more websites that they use to interact
with their users or customers.

38
00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.290
One of the most common needs
that organizations have,

39
00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.490
is to understand how users
interact with the website itself.

40
00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.300
Questions we might want to
answer include the following.

41
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.940
How many users are coming to the website,
and where are they coming from?

42
00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.310
How long do people stay on the website?

43
00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.840
How do people navigate
through the website?

44
00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.420
Are people getting stuck somewhere,
or is navigation fluid?

45
00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.640
How often do users access help or
FAQ sections of the site?

46
00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.060
How often are certain actions,
like purchasing, happening?

47
00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.770
When do they leave the website and where
do they go when they leave the website?

48
00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.180
Understanding these types of patterns
helps us assess whether our website is

49
00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.410
well designed and whether we
are stimulating the right volumes and

50
00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:31.920
types of activity.

51
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.850
For example,
let's say the we're an online retailer.

52
00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.238
We might find the traffic to
our site is very strong and

53
00:02:37.238 --> 00:02:39.360
that people spend quite
a while browsing products and

54
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.240
regularly add products to
their online shopping cart.

55
00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.380
But for some reason those
products aren't being purchased.

56
00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.290
By looking closely at exactly where
customers are falling out of the process,

57
00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.170
we might find that a point in the
navigation path is broken or confusing.

58
00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.960
So how do we typically get
this type of information?

59
00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.070
It turns out that most websites have
measurement mechanisms built into

60
00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.560
the site itself.

61
00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.460
Usually each page or element on
a page contains a small piece of code

62
00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.620
that generates a message when your
user arrives or clicks on something.

63
00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.580
These messages are written to logs and
can be interpreted using a web analytic

64
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.230
services like those provided by Google's,
Adobe, IBM and Web Trends among others.

65
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.480
Or driven directly into
an organization's data environment,

66
00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.400
we can incorporate the data from website
into a variety of descriptive productive

67
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.980
prescriptive analysis.

68
00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.740
And there are a number of common web
analytics matrix that are used to

69
00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.350
characterize behavior.

70
00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.870
Two very common types of analysis you
might see are funnel analysis and

71
00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:34.530
path analysis.

72
00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.650
Funnel analysis traces how many customers
move from one major stage of a process

73
00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:40.610
to the next.

74
00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.300
For example, from the website
homepage to a shopping cart,

75
00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.080
to a registration process,
to an actual purchase payment.

76
00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.216
The visualization of this type of
analysis tends to resemble a funnel.

77
00:03:51.216 --> 00:03:52.598
Hence the name.

78
00:03:52.598 --> 00:03:57.520
Path analysis is a bit more involved and
quantifies the ways that customers

79
00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.395
navigate through a website
which is usually not linear.

80
00:04:00.395 --> 00:04:04.790
Here's a simple example of how path
information might be represented based

81
00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:05.370
on web data.

82
00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.540
The other major way that organizations
use the web is for online advertising.

83
00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.590
We may want to ensure that our website
is listed prominently when people

84
00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:15.270
search the web.

85
00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:19.305
Or we may want to drive people to our
website from other sales channels by using

86
00:04:19.305 --> 00:04:21.250
ads on third party websites.

87
00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.340
The way we measure the activities
stimulated by online advertising is

88
00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.040
similar to the way we
measure other web activity.

89
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.792
Namely through the same snippets of the
code that fire when someone clicks on our

90
00:04:30.792 --> 00:04:35.020
ads or someone arrives at our web site
from specific third party locations.

91
00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.730
However, the way we figure out where and
how to advertise involves some special

92
00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:42.160
types of analysis,
including Search Engine Optimization.

93
00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.390
Where we try to understand the algorithms
used by search engines and

94
00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:49.245
set up our web site to optimize
when our web site shows up.

95
00:04:49.245 --> 00:04:51.810
The web is obviously massive and complex.

96
00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.300
And there are many more ways in which
web data can be used in analytics.

97
00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.190
But again, these are the most common
ones you'll see in most organizations.

98
00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:00.680
Let's move on mobile,

99
00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.890
first many of the same ideas that
apply to that web also fly to mobile.

100
00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:07.430
Users can access web
sites on mobile devices.

101
00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.230
And we like to understand
that experience and

102
00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:13.420
potentially how that experience differs
across different types of devices.

103
00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:16.740
We can often use web analytics
techniques to get the answers.

104
00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.240
Mobile also adds another dimension
to our advertising use case.

105
00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.620
Companies are increasingly using available
information about a user's location

106
00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:28.550
to provide highly localized targeted ads
to the right people at the right place,

107
00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:29.680
at the right time.

108
00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.260
However one of the richest areas
of insight provided by mobile data

109
00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:37.020
is around how people and objects as
a whole are distributed geographically and

110
00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:38.680
how they move around.

111
00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.510
It's possible for many companies
to get access to this information.

112
00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:43.550
Here is some examples.

113
00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.650
A retailer's mobile application ask for

114
00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:50.340
permission to access GPS
information on a device.

115
00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:54.180
A wireless carrier detects which
cell towers connect to a device.

116
00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:57.550
A fast food restaurant chain sees
when a mobile device connects

117
00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.150
to a Wi-Fi hotspot in the store.

118
00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.800
A trucking company installs wireless
devices in all its vehicles.

119
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.950
There are a wide variety of marketing,
sales,

120
00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:10.030
and operations problems that can
be by understanding location data.

121
00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:13.970
In fact, there are entire businesses that
are built with location data at the core.

122
00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:17.050
Think of your favorite navigation or
traffic app on your phone.

123
00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:19.890
There are also businesses that
are using precisely positioned

124
00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:22.510
connection points within
their physical locations

125
00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:25.650
to track how customers move
through a building or store.

126
00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:29.040
Broadly speaking the techniques we
use when working with location data

127
00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:32.540
fall into a class of analytics
called spatial analytics.

128
00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:35.950
Normally this involves plotting
location points on a map of some sort.

129
00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:39.230
And using visualization or
algorithms to identify patterns and

130
00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:41.050
draw inferences on behaviors.

131
00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:44.900
We would also use related techniques like
boundary triggering, cluster pattern

132
00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:49.780
analysis, or hot spot analysis to drive
insights around specific problems.

133
00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:53.190
Let's look at a simple example of how
we might use mobile location data.

134
00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:56.430
To identify different patterns of
behavior and perhaps assign specific

135
00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:59.650
characteristics or segments to
customers based on what we see.

136
00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:01.560
Supposed we're working in
a wireless company and

137
00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:05.420
we want to examine where customers tend
to use their phones for making calls.

138
00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:08.650
We might use location data to
identify a few patterns like these.

139
00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:12.924
In the first figure, we have a bit
of a a barbel pattern with use on

140
00:07:12.924 --> 00:07:15.670
a path between two end point clusters.

141
00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:18.880
This might represent someone travelling
between work and home, or school and

142
00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:19.740
home locations.

143
00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:26.270
In the second example we see a single
dominate use location, this could be

144
00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:30.010
someone who works at home like
a homemaker or owner of a home business.

145
00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:33.420
In the third example we see clusters
of use in various locations across

146
00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:34.780
the United States.

147
00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:37.790
This might be a consultant or
travelling sales person.

148
00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:41.550
We could use classification based on these
patterns directly in business strategy or

149
00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:42.880
marketing decisions.

150
00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:46.820
Or we could drive these distinctions into
other analytical efforts such as broader

151
00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:49.600
segmentation or
direct marketing activities.

152
00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:52.690
The last emerging area we'll
cover is social media.

153
00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:55.270
As we noted earlier this
is a pretty broad space.

154
00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:58.440
But let's look at a couple of the most
common business problems that social media

155
00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:00.060
can help to inform.

156
00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:04.620
The first is helping us understand how our
organization is perceived in the market.

157
00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:08.690
Analysis of the patterns and content
of comments made about our organization

158
00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:11.070
can help us identify what
things are going well.

159
00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:13.630
And whether there might be
issues we need to address.

160
00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:17.250
This in turn can help shape strategy and
tactics in the market.

161
00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:18.740
So, how do we actually do it?

162
00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:22.460
Typically, we start with a tool or service
that scrapes relevant content from a set

163
00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:25.750
of social media sites,
blogs or other sources.

164
00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:28.320
Using this data,
we can construct simple measures,

165
00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:31.130
like how many times people
refer to our organization.

166
00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:33.780
And where or
when people are talking about us.

167
00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:36.670
We can also employ this technique
called sediment analysis

168
00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:40.420
which uses text mining to identify
words or phrases that are positive or

169
00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:43.855
negative or which refer to specific
ideas or events of interest.

170
00:08:43.855 --> 00:08:48.440
This type of social media analysis tends
to focus on how people relate to our

171
00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:50.978
organization individually or as a whole.

172
00:08:50.978 --> 00:08:54.160
However, there are some really
interesting insights that can be gained

173
00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.150
by examining how people
interact with each other.

174
00:08:57.150 --> 00:09:00.260
There's some ways this can be done
using publicly available data but

175
00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:04.210
the richest insights are possible when
an organization has access to a complete

176
00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:05.930
set of interaction.

177
00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:09.500
Social networks themselves obviously
have access to this type of data.

178
00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:12.820
But so do organizations like
telecommunications companies

179
00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:16.280
who can see things like calling
patterns across all customers.

180
00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:20.350
If we do have access to broad network
data, we employ methods like social

181
00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:24.030
network analysis to identify
interaction patterns, groupings and

182
00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:27.810
even the roles of individuals
within their own personal networks.

183
00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:29.600
Let's use an example to illustrate.

184
00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:33.070
Let say we're able to see how a group
of people interact with each other.

185
00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:36.760
We can use the presence of interactions
to construct the following network graph

186
00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:37.940
of the group.

187
00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:41.225
Right away we can see what looks
like two more connected subgroups

188
00:09:41.225 --> 00:09:45.130
linked by a few individuals with common
connections between those subgroups.

189
00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:49.390
Now with only 11 people it's pretty
easy to see how the connections exist.

190
00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:53.440
But you can imagine how difficult visual
interpretations might be with hundreds,

191
00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.550
thousands or even millions of people.

192
00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:59.160
It turns out that we can use some
numerical matrix to identify people who

193
00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.960
occupy key positions
within a social network.

194
00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:05.640
Here are a few popular measures each
of which has a specific numerical

195
00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:07.170
calculations behind them.

196
00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:09.060
The first is Network Centrality,

197
00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:12.580
which is the number of direct
neighbors someone has in the network.

198
00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:13.870
As the name suggests,

199
00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:17.690
these are people who tend to sit
at the center of network clusters.

200
00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:20.740
So, who do you think has the highest
degree of Network Centrality

201
00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:21.400
in our network?

202
00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:26.660
If you said Jane, you're correct.

203
00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:31.160
With four direct neighbors, Jane has more
direct connections than anyone else.

204
00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.930
A second measure is called
the Closeness Centrality

205
00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:38.560
which is basically how close each
person is to all others in the network.

206
00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:40.840
This one is a bit harder to do visually.

207
00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:44.496
Can you identify a couple of people who
might be the closest to all others?

208
00:10:48.008 --> 00:10:52.156
In turns out that Frank actually has
the highest level of Closeness Centrality,

209
00:10:52.156 --> 00:10:54.320
just edging out Ethan.

210
00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.800
A third measure is Betweeness Centrality,

211
00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:00.670
which is a measure that identifies key
linkages between nodes of a network.

212
00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:01.690
What do you think about this one?

213
00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:08.530
Again, both Ethan and Frank occupy
critical positions in the network,

214
00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:10.160
as they link the two nodes together.

215
00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:15.200
The final measure we'll look at is
called Clustering Coefficient Centrality

216
00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:19.080
which is also known as the all my
friends know each other measure.

217
00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:22.830
It's the degree to which someone's direct
connections are connected to each other.

218
00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:25.083
Who do you think scores
highly in our example?

219
00:11:28.576 --> 00:11:31.658
Because all of Chris and
Brad's friends are also connected to

220
00:11:31.658 --> 00:11:36.180
each other they have the highest degree
of Clustering Coefficient Centrality.

221
00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:39.750
In fact when we have a set of people
who are all connected to each other

222
00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:43.980
we called this is Clique it turns
out the Brad, Chris, Dave and

223
00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:47.819
Amy form a Clique in an narrow since they
were all connected directly to each other.

224
00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:51.370
So how might we use this information?

225
00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:54.671
One of the things we might do is
try to identify influencers within

226
00:11:54.671 --> 00:11:57.390
a social network and
engage them in some way.

227
00:11:57.390 --> 00:12:01.518
Our hope is that we can ultimately reach
more people with less effort by taking

228
00:12:01.518 --> 00:12:03.043
advantage of word of mouth or

229
00:12:03.043 --> 00:12:06.676
other social cues that influencers
might propagate on our behalf.

230
00:12:06.676 --> 00:12:11.110
We might also make sure that influencers
have great costumer experiences.

231
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:15.030
Since the impact of poor costumer
experience can likewise be amplified far

232
00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:16.530
beyond one individual.

233
00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:18.664
But who exactly is in influence?

234
00:12:18.664 --> 00:12:22.010
It's not always the case that people at
the center of the network are the most

235
00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:23.480
influential.

236
00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:26.660
Usually what we need to do is a little
testing against our network to see how

237
00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:28.260
messages propagate.

238
00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:33.150
For example we can send information about
an offer to a set of potential influencers

239
00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:35.900
then look to see who
else seeks out the offer.

240
00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:39.610
This would provide information
about who the real influencers are.

241
00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:42.130
Our centrality measures
help start the process

242
00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:45.840
by identifying the best candidates for
a potential influencer pool.

243
00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:49.740
One thing you may be noticing, is that
while all these areas, the web, mobile and

244
00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:54.050
social media are relatively new in the
broad history of business and commerce.

245
00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:57.970
The basic business issues associated with
them are not really all that different

246
00:12:57.970 --> 00:13:00.550
than those organizations have faced for
decades.

247
00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:03.350
Businesses have always needed to
understand how their sales and

248
00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:05.560
communication channels are functioning.

249
00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:06.770
Understanding location and

250
00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:10.010
where people move have long
been a part of retail strategy.

251
00:13:10.010 --> 00:13:14.010
And the impact of community and word
of mouth is as old as commerce itself.

252
00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:17.730
What is different is how broad
a reach newer technologies have and

253
00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:20.800
the amount of data we are able
to capture about how they work.

254
00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:23.210
This opens up all sorts
of new possibilities, and

255
00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:25.440
of course, opportunities for analytics.

256
00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:28.983
Keep this in mind as we continue to
explore how we turn our analyses into

257
00:13:28.983 --> 00:13:31.397
strategy and tactics for
action in the market.
