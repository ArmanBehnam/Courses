00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:01.520
Welcome back!

2
00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:05.060
If you taken some of the other courses in
this specialization, you might recall that

3
00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.710
we introduced a framework called
the Information-Action Value Chain.

4
00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.860
This framework describes the sequential
process that starts with events and

5
00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.670
characteristics in the real world, and
ends with an action in the market place.

6
00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:16.330
In this video,

7
00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:19.720
we're going to spend just a few minutes
reintroducing the value chains, so

8
00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.550
we can set the stage for the rest of the
topics we'll be covering in the course.

9
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.430
Broadly, we can think about the practice
of analytics in three parts.

10
00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.500
Things that happen before we
execute the analytical methods,

11
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.610
the methods themselves, and
things that happen afterwards.

12
00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.440
Lets begin by reviewing what happens
before we execute analytics.

13
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.510
We start with something in the real world.

14
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.940
This could be an event,
like someone making a purchase or

15
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.650
using a product or service,
the person or product itself, or

16
00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.560
even natural phenomenal like a thunder
storm or the temperature outside.

17
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.325
For any of these things to be of use to
me as an analyst, I need to have data.

18
00:00:53.325 --> 00:00:56.150
There needs to be a mechanism
that captures a physical or

19
00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.330
digital representation of that real
world phenomenon and puts it somewhere.

20
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.580
For every event of interest
in the real world,

21
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.610
there needs to be a system
that captures it.

22
00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.590
We often refer to these as source systems.

23
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.187
For a variety of reasons,
it's usually not practical for

24
00:01:10.187 --> 00:01:12.940
an analyst to access data
directly in source systems.

25
00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.830
It tends to be more convenient to bring
data together in some common location, and

26
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.550
organize it in a way that is
more suitable for analysis.

27
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.420
Most often this location is a physical
system called a data warehouse or

28
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.280
enterprise data warehouse, although there
are a variety of methods of doing this,

29
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.080
both physical and virtual.

30
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.330
However, to actually use this data
in something like a statistical

31
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.130
software package,
a business intelligence tool or

32
00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.180
even Excel, we need a way to extract
the data we want to work with.

33
00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.710
The extraction method will vary based
on how the data is stored, but for

34
00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.480
relational databases it usually involves
the application of structured query

35
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.340
language or SQL.

36
00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.230
Once we have a data set suitable for
analysis, we can move

37
00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.810
onto the second part of our value chain,
actually executing analytical methods.

38
00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.250
There are a ton of different
ways to analyze data, but

39
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.100
broadly speaking they tend to
fall into three categories.

40
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.590
Descriptive analytics, predictive
analytics and prescriptive analytics.

41
00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.250
If you've taken other courses in this
specialization or other courses in data

42
00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.510
analytics, chances are you've already been
exposed to a number of these techniques.

43
00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.160
But as a quick review, recall that
descriptive analytics help us describe

44
00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.220
what things look like now or
what happened in the past.

45
00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.119
The idea is to use that information to
better understand the business environment

46
00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:28.566
and how it works and to apply that
knowledge along with business acumen to

47
00:02:28.566 --> 00:02:30.448
make better decisions going forward.

48
00:02:30.448 --> 00:02:34.913
Descriptive analytics can take the form of
simple aggregations or cross tabulations

49
00:02:34.913 --> 00:02:38.883
of data, simple statistical measures,
more sophisticated applications

50
00:02:38.883 --> 00:02:43.052
of descriptive statistics or advanced
association or clustering algorithm.

51
00:02:43.052 --> 00:02:46.761
Predictive analytics helps us take what we
know about what happened in the past, and

52
00:02:46.761 --> 00:02:50.430
use that information to help us predict
what will happen in the future.

53
00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.520
This almost always involves
the application of advanced statistical

54
00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.600
methods or other numeric techniques.

55
00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.920
Finally, prescriptive analytics provides
recommendations on what we should do or

56
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.730
what choice we should make to
achieve a certain outcome.

57
00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.420
It usually involves the integration
of numerical optimization techniques,

58
00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.210
with business rules and
even financial models.

59
00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:12.460
As you might imagine, an analytical
project might use a combination of

60
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:17.110
descriptive, predictive and prescriptive
methods to achieve a particular objective.

61
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:18.800
Once the analytical
methods have been applied,

62
00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.130
we move on to the third
part of our framework.

63
00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.970
It's really this part of the process
where we will be spending most of our

64
00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.260
time in this course.

65
00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.430
The first step in taking our analysis
to action, is to summarize and

66
00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:29.830
interpret results.

67
00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.175
Mechanically, summarizing an analysis
usually involves identifying the few

68
00:03:34.175 --> 00:03:38.960
charts, graphs or tables, that make it as
easy as possible to see what's going on.

69
00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.825
And supplementing those figures with
a short narrative that explains

70
00:03:41.825 --> 00:03:43.290
what they mean.

71
00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.565
However, this is usually
much easier said than done.

72
00:03:46.565 --> 00:03:50.050
Determining how to best visualize data,
can be a real challenge.

73
00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.887
Doing this well is as much
an art as it is a science.

74
00:03:52.887 --> 00:03:56.635
Interpreting data analysis often
requires a high degree of context and

75
00:03:56.635 --> 00:03:59.385
a deep understanding about
how a business works.

76
00:03:59.385 --> 00:04:01.525
Once we understand what's
actually going on,

77
00:04:01.525 --> 00:04:05.115
we can use those insights to create
a plan for how to take some action.

78
00:04:05.115 --> 00:04:09.475
Often this involves setting a high level
strategy, then developing specific actions

79
00:04:09.475 --> 00:04:13.340
or tactics that we can take to
achieve a specific outcome.

80
00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.602
We can develop alternatives, discuss pros
and cons, develop financial models, or

81
00:04:17.602 --> 00:04:20.770
run a follow on analysis
to help assess each option.

82
00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:22.470
However, even if we're able to come up for

83
00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.360
a plan for action that we think
will have a meaningful impact,

84
00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.230
it's likely that we're going to have
to convince someone to actually do it.

85
00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:32.252
We called this step of
the process Delivering the Pitch.

86
00:04:32.252 --> 00:04:35.240
Here, it's critical that we effectively
communicate our results and

87
00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.300
sell the merit of our proposal.

88
00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.385
We'll spend a fair amount of time in this
course talking about how to communicate

89
00:04:40.385 --> 00:04:41.140
results.

90
00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.050
But generally speaking,
clarity, simplicity,

91
00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.710
value and quality will be key
ideas that guide our approach.

92
00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.870
If we are successful, we reach the final
stage of our framework, taking action.

93
00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.250
The nature of the action depends on our
strategy and objectives, and quite often

94
00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:59.610
will involve another round of analysis to
assess the impact we've had in the market.

95
00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:00.990
So let's recap what we've covered today.

96
00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.680
We reviewed the steps that happen
before our analysis begins,

97
00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.900
we describe three types of analytics,
descriptive, predictive and

98
00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.650
prescriptive, and we outline the steps we
take after applying analytical methods

99
00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.030
to take our analysis to
action in the market.

100
00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:19.340
Again in this course, we'll spend most
of our time learning about what happens

101
00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.320
after the analysis is complete.

102
00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:25.290
But keep in mind how this steps relate
to our analytical process as a whole.

103
00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:25.790
See you next time.
