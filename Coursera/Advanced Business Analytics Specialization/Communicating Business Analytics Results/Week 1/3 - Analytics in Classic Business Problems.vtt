00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.800
Before we completely transition from
analytic methods to all the things we need

2
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:07.820
to think about after our analysis is
complete, it's useful to take a step back

3
00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:10.950
and remind ourselves what types of
problems we're trying to solve and

4
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.330
what the business drivers are behind them.

5
00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.663
Our objective is start shifting our
focus back from the technical aspects of

6
00:00:17.663 --> 00:00:21.870
our analytical process to the contextual
nature of underlying problem.

7
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.294
We also want to reinforce the connection
between some of the methods you

8
00:00:25.294 --> 00:00:29.510
may have seen in other courses and the
real world problems they try to address.

9
00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.780
We obviously can't cover every possible
type of analysis you might come

10
00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.680
across in your organization.

11
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.860
But we'll try to present a cross section
of problems that occur frequently

12
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.250
in many industries.

13
00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.929
In this video,
we'll look at what we might call classic

14
00:00:41.929 --> 00:00:45.122
problems that have a significant
history in business functions.

15
00:00:45.122 --> 00:00:49.408
Specifically, we'll discuss segmentation,
direct marketing and

16
00:00:49.408 --> 00:00:53.764
customer lifetime value,
statistical process control, routing and

17
00:00:53.764 --> 00:00:58.950
inventory management, queuing and
staffing, and credit risk and fraud.

18
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.820
In a separate video, we'll focus on
some emergent problems and analytical

19
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.190
approaches associated with technologies
like the web, mobile and social media.

20
00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.310
For this overview, we'll keep our
discussion at a pretty high level.

21
00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.648
We'll take each idea, describe what it is,
talk about why we actually do it,

22
00:01:14.648 --> 00:01:19.021
then list a few of the analytical methods
that we might apply to make it happen.

23
00:01:19.021 --> 00:01:20.300
For some of our examples,

24
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.860
we'll look simple visualizations
that might accompany the analysis.

25
00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.103
This should help get you thinking about
some of the topics coming later in

26
00:01:27.103 --> 00:01:27.697
the course.

27
00:01:27.697 --> 00:01:29.450
Let's start with segmentation.

28
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.019
The idea behind segmentation
is pretty simple.

29
00:01:32.019 --> 00:01:34.747
We're basically trying to find
groups of customers or events or

30
00:01:34.747 --> 00:01:38.320
items with similar characteristics and
grouping them together.

31
00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.920
Generally, we want elements in our
groups to be as similar as possible to

32
00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:42.800
each other.

33
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.278
But at the same time, we want the groups
themselves to be different enough that it

34
00:01:46.278 --> 00:01:48.028
makes sense to treat them differently.

35
00:01:48.028 --> 00:01:53.360
When elements within a group are similar,
we call that homogeneity within groups.

36
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.523
And when the groups themselves
are different from each other,

37
00:01:56.523 --> 00:01:58.798
we call that heterogeneity between groups.

38
00:01:58.798 --> 00:02:01.540
A good segmentation has both properties.

39
00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.610
There are many uses of segmentation.

40
00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.131
A business may develop different products
to serve the needs of different customer

41
00:02:07.131 --> 00:02:07.641
segments.

42
00:02:07.641 --> 00:02:09.871
It may use different
communication methods or

43
00:02:09.871 --> 00:02:12.798
channels to sell the same
products to different customers.

44
00:02:12.798 --> 00:02:16.195
Some businesses even model their
organizational structures after

45
00:02:16.195 --> 00:02:17.988
the segments they intend to serve.

46
00:02:17.988 --> 00:02:22.327
In most cases, the business is trying to
optimize the effectiveness and efficiency

47
00:02:22.327 --> 00:02:25.763
of their activities by customizing
them in some way to the market.

48
00:02:25.763 --> 00:02:28.840
Segmentation helps to inform
how that should be done.

49
00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.782
Segmentation can also be used as
a first step in a larger analysis.

50
00:02:32.782 --> 00:02:37.072
For example, I might use customer segments
as inputs to a statistical model,

51
00:02:37.072 --> 00:02:40.647
like a regression, to predict
some type of behavior, whether or

52
00:02:40.647 --> 00:02:43.380
not I intend to act on that
prediction by segment.

53
00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.318
There are quite a few analytic
methods that can be applied to

54
00:02:46.318 --> 00:02:50.731
execute a segmentation analysis, including
factor analysis and principal components

55
00:02:50.731 --> 00:02:55.410
analysis, clustering, and decision trees
or other propensity modeling techniques.

56
00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.480
For example, we might use a clustering
technique that yields an output like this.

57
00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.250
Here we have three natural groupings
of elements on two dimensions.

58
00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.030
We could consider treating these
groups as separate segments in our

59
00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.480
business activities.

60
00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.654
Let's move on to some applications related
to marketing and customer lifetime value.

61
00:03:12.654 --> 00:03:16.601
There's obviously a lot of different
things that a marketing organisation might

62
00:03:16.601 --> 00:03:20.601
do, but one common need is the ability to
predict whether a specific customers will

63
00:03:20.601 --> 00:03:22.400
exhibit some behavior of interest.

64
00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.130
Such as purchasing a product,
taking an offer, changing products or

65
00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.760
leaving to go somewhere else.

66
00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.560
Usually, the reason we want to
understand these behaviors is so

67
00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.200
we can interact with customers in
a more efficient and effective way.

68
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.573
It can be expensive to
reach out to customers, and

69
00:03:36.573 --> 00:03:40.473
we'd rather spend our limited resources
reaching out to those who are most likely

70
00:03:40.473 --> 00:03:42.241
to respond in the way we want them to.

71
00:03:42.241 --> 00:03:46.180
Even when communication is relatively
cheap, like email or text messages,

72
00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.059
marketers want to avoid overloading
customers with too many messages, and

73
00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:54.139
therefore seek to only provide customers
with the most relevant information.

74
00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:59.210
Like segmentation, we can also use
predictions as inputs to larger analyses.

75
00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:02.097
One example of this is
customer lifetime value.

76
00:04:02.097 --> 00:04:06.087
A customer lifetime value calculation
basically just adds up all the revenues

77
00:04:06.087 --> 00:04:08.868
and costs associated with
the customer over time, and

78
00:04:08.868 --> 00:04:11.550
expresses them in today's dollars.

79
00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.830
It's usually represented by
a discounted cashflow equation

80
00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.086
that looks something like this, where t is
the time period and r is a discount rate.

81
00:04:19.086 --> 00:04:24.510
We can use event predictions to drive
certain revenue or cost producing events.

82
00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.480
But one of the most common uses is to
make predictions on how long a customer's

83
00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.471
lifetime will actually be, or what
the value of n should be in this equation.

84
00:04:32.471 --> 00:04:36.283
Methods for even prediction can include
propensity modeling techniques like

85
00:04:36.283 --> 00:04:40.150
logistic regression, decision trees or
neural nets, survival analysis, or

86
00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.070
even simple historical observation.

87
00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:46.803
The use of deep analytics in the practice
of marketing is almost a given in today's

88
00:04:46.803 --> 00:04:47.601
organizations.

89
00:04:47.601 --> 00:04:51.385
However, some of the earliest widespread
uses of data analytics were in operations

90
00:04:51.385 --> 00:04:54.958
and manufacturing, where techniques
were applied to help businesses improve

91
00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:57.010
efficiency and effectiveness.

92
00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:01.580
Statistical process control, for example,
has been in use since the 1920s.

93
00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.000
Originally applied to
manufacturing processes,

94
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.640
the basic idea around statistical process
control is that we establish a process,

95
00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.390
measure the natural
variability in that process.

96
00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:14.930
Then set up a monitoring mechanism that
alerts us if the process changes for

97
00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:15.980
some reason.

98
00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:19.793
Often this technique is used as part of
a larger objective of process improvement

99
00:05:19.793 --> 00:05:23.570
where we understand a process,
reduce the variation in the process.

100
00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:27.247
Then work to improve the overall
level of performance in that process.

101
00:05:27.247 --> 00:05:31.353
For example, lets say we wanted to measure
the percentage of defects at particular

102
00:05:31.353 --> 00:05:33.250
stage in an assembly line.

103
00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.399
And we wanted to be alerted if
there is a spike in defects or

104
00:05:36.399 --> 00:05:39.362
if the average percentage moved up or
down over time.

105
00:05:39.362 --> 00:05:43.511
We could use statistical process control
to help detect these changes in pursuit

106
00:05:43.511 --> 00:05:44.618
of quality control.

107
00:05:44.618 --> 00:05:47.871
Similarly, we could use the same
technique on quantity measures,

108
00:05:47.871 --> 00:05:50.679
like the amount of material
required to accomplish a job.

109
00:05:50.679 --> 00:05:54.119
Or even time, like how long it
takes to accomplish a task or

110
00:05:54.119 --> 00:05:56.098
to complete a process as a whole.

111
00:05:56.098 --> 00:05:59.491
Again, while this technique
originated in manufacturing,

112
00:05:59.491 --> 00:06:02.690
it can really be applied
to any repeatable process.

113
00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:06.438
And there are applications in just about
every industry in functional area.

114
00:06:06.438 --> 00:06:07.455
As far as methods go,

115
00:06:07.455 --> 00:06:12.020
those used in statistical process control
are actually pretty straightforward.

116
00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:16.230
Normally it involves application of
classical statistics and sampling methods,

117
00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:20.520
coupled with some specific ways of looking
at the data, like this control chart.

118
00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.548
Here we just have the value of
some measurement over time.

119
00:06:23.548 --> 00:06:27.113
The lines at top and bottom are called
upper and lower control limits,

120
00:06:27.113 --> 00:06:31.440
and are calculated using basic statistics
derived from historical measurements.

121
00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:32.340
Early in the series,

122
00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:34.780
there’s some natural variation in
the measure around the center line.

123
00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:38.380
But there's also one point
that exceeds the upper limit.

124
00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:41.613
Later in the series, it appears that
there has been a shift of some sort of

125
00:06:41.613 --> 00:06:45.650
in a process and where the points
consistently lie below the center line.

126
00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:48.850
A second class of operational problems
involve the management and movement of

127
00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:52.930
physical items, like raw materials,
inventories, and finished products.

128
00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:55.430
Generally speaking,
businesses want to make sure they have

129
00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:58.020
all the right items in the right
place at the right time.

130
00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:02.120
But they also want to minimize cost and
the certain constraints on production,

131
00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:06.220
storage, and transportation that
restrict what they're able to do.

132
00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:10.150
Examples of common problems in this area
include the newsvendor problem, where we

133
00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:14.840
need to choose how much inventory to buy
based on expected patterns in sales.

134
00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:16.215
The transportation problem,

135
00:07:16.215 --> 00:07:20.320
where we must decide how to route product
from one set of production points to a set

136
00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:23.180
of consumption points in
the most optimal way.

137
00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:26.395
And the assignment problem,
where we need to allocate materials or

138
00:07:26.395 --> 00:07:31.180
tasks to machines or other resources
to allow the most efficient processing.

139
00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:33.080
The methods used to solve these problems,

140
00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:36.236
broadly fall into prescriptive
analytics category.

141
00:07:36.236 --> 00:07:40.255
And include optimization and simulation
techniques like linear programming,

142
00:07:40.255 --> 00:07:42.441
Monte Carlo analysis, queuing analysis,

143
00:07:42.441 --> 00:07:46.890
as well as a variety of specific
mathematical methods and procedures.

144
00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:50.450
A closely related class of problems
involves optimizing the movement,

145
00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:52.740
activities, and positioning of people.

146
00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:54.970
There are all sorts of problems
that fall into this category.

147
00:07:54.970 --> 00:08:00.260
Here are some examples, how many people to
staff at a call center or retail store.

148
00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.930
How to set up the order line
at a fast food restaurant.

149
00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:06.140
Where to deploy sales
personnel across regions.

150
00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:07.010
What level and

151
00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:09.890
mix of healthcare professionals
should be present at a hospital.

152
00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:15.298
How to balance visitor traffic across an
amusement park over the course of the day.

153
00:08:15.298 --> 00:08:19.134
The business objectives around these
type of problems can be similar to those

154
00:08:19.134 --> 00:08:22.854
involving objects, including maximizing
efficiency and throughput and

155
00:08:22.854 --> 00:08:23.809
minimizing cost.

156
00:08:23.809 --> 00:08:26.469
However, they also tend
to evolve a customer or

157
00:08:26.469 --> 00:08:29.069
employee satisfaction component, as well.

158
00:08:29.069 --> 00:08:32.540
Most companies want to have happy
customers and happy employees.

159
00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:35.074
And there are variety of
ways in which staffing and

160
00:08:35.074 --> 00:08:37.804
movement can impact just
how happy those people are.

161
00:08:37.804 --> 00:08:40.700
For customers,
we may want to minimize wait times or

162
00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:44.390
ensure that the right resources
are available to help the right customers.

163
00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:49.210
On the employee side, we may seek to avoid
task monotony or best ensure that people's

164
00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:52.160
jobs are well-matched to their skills or
other career objectives.

165
00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:53.890
As you might imagine,
there are applications for

166
00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:56.640
this type of problem solving in
many organizational functions,

167
00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:00.820
including operations, customer care,
sales, and human resources.

168
00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:03.960
The methods we use to solve these
problems are also similar to those we

169
00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:07.427
apply to the movement of objects,
although the data elements we optimize or

170
00:09:07.427 --> 00:09:10.097
the constraints that apply
might be somewhat different.

171
00:09:10.097 --> 00:09:13.903
Again, optimization in simulation
techniques and application of queuing

172
00:09:13.903 --> 00:09:17.570
theory are at the core of
the analytics we apply these cases.

173
00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:21.600
There are also some pretty innovative ways
of visualizing these type of analysis,

174
00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:24.490
including be able to
watch how costumers move

175
00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:26.980
through a 3D rendered
environment over time.

176
00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:29.950
The last set of common problems we'll
discus in this video are around

177
00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:32.030
credit risk and fraud detection.

178
00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:35.430
These problems are dominant in
industries like financial services, but

179
00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:38.310
are used in pretty much any
company that extends credit

180
00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:40.480
by performing services
in advance of payment.

181
00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.082
Or where there is opportunity for

182
00:09:42.082 --> 00:09:45.411
people to financially take advantage
of an organization via fraud.

183
00:09:45.411 --> 00:09:48.889
Some prominent examples are in
telecommunications, utilities,

184
00:09:48.889 --> 00:09:51.050
insurance and healthcare.

185
00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:53.847
The business objectives here
can be pretty straightforward.

186
00:09:53.847 --> 00:09:57.007
First, we're trying to balance
the way we provide products and

187
00:09:57.007 --> 00:10:00.633
services to the market with the risk
that we might not get paid for fully for

188
00:10:00.633 --> 00:10:02.180
those products and services.

189
00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:04.372
Based on the credit
worthiness of an individual,

190
00:10:04.372 --> 00:10:07.098
an organization might structure
its products differently.

191
00:10:07.098 --> 00:10:11.337
For example, a utility might require a
deposit, or a mortgage company might offer

192
00:10:11.337 --> 00:10:14.780
lower or higher interest
rate to different borrowers.

193
00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:18.260
We might also want to try to detect
when something fishy is going on.

194
00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.216
This can mean different things
in different organizations.

195
00:10:21.216 --> 00:10:23.410
One familiar example is with credit cards,

196
00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:27.200
where mechanisms are put in place to
detect abnormal purchasing behavior, and

197
00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:31.300
may even put an automatic hold on the
account when certain activity is observed.

198
00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:35.000
Typically, a company extending credit will
develop their own risk models based on

199
00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.400
both internal data and
external credit bureau data.

200
00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:41.150
The methods involved are generally
predictive analytics methods

201
00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:43.958
like logistic regression,
decision trees, or neural networks.

202
00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:47.019
For fraud detection,
we might employ predictive models, but

203
00:10:47.019 --> 00:10:51.179
we may also use things like descriptive
statistics, statistical process control or

204
00:10:51.179 --> 00:10:56.350
other data driven heuristics to trigger
interventions based on observed activity.

205
00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:59.370
So that's a quick spin through some of
the more well established type of analytic

206
00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:01.650
problems you might see in
the world of business.

207
00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:05.145
Again, they only represent a fraction
of all the applications of analytics

208
00:11:05.145 --> 00:11:06.080
that are out there.

209
00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:09.767
However, this is a pretty good starting
set to get us thinking about how

210
00:11:09.767 --> 00:11:13.331
we visualize and interpret analysis,
how we develop strategies and

211
00:11:13.331 --> 00:11:17.387
tactics to address the underlying
business problems, and how we communicate

212
00:11:17.387 --> 00:11:21.148
both the results of our analysis and
our proposal for how to take action.
