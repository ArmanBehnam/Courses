00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.560
Even though our focus
is on data federation,

2
00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:06.240
we should know that a graph is
not the only way to display data.

3
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.480
Two other commonly used
vehicles are text and tables.

4
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.930
In this video, we discuss the three
common vehicles and contrast them.

5
00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:14.980
By the end of this video,

6
00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.900
you should be able to determine when
it is appropriate use each of them.

7
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.410
The first one we would
like to discuss is text.

8
00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.450
Text should be use primarily in two cases.

9
00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.390
First, if you only have a few numbers,

10
00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.390
displaying the numbers using text
may be the most effective method.

11
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.720
You can actually display
precise values in text.

12
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.599
Your audience really does not need graphs
to help them digest just a few numbers.

13
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.090
Second, if you have a really complex
dataset and relationships in the data,

14
00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.830
tables and graphs may not be able to
express patterns and relationships well.

15
00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:51.750
Tables and graphs can be limited in
that they really do not go beyond two or

16
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:52.550
three dimensions.

17
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.940
If you choose to use text, you are not
restrict to two or three dimensions.

18
00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.996
Sometimes, text is used
together with tables and

19
00:01:00.996 --> 00:01:04.515
graphs express important or complex ideas.

20
00:01:04.515 --> 00:01:08.390
Infographic is a popular way to present
information quickly and clearly.

21
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.437
Text is often used as a primary way
to present data and infographics as,

22
00:01:12.437 --> 00:01:17.730
typically, we only want to draw audience
attention to a few key statistics.

23
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.460
An example is an infographic
on global warming.

24
00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.635
Note that only one data graph is used
where text is the primary way to

25
00:01:24.635 --> 00:01:26.040
display data.

26
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.810
This is also true for
many other examples we can find.

27
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.120
Table is another popular
vehicle to display data.

28
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.240
In a table,
data is arranged in columns and rows.

29
00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.130
A table has several
distinctive advantages.

30
00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.230
First, it makes it easy to
look up individual values and

31
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.390
compare multiple values.

32
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.370
Second, it can also represent numbers
precisely, which should be contrasted with

33
00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.840
most graphs, which cannot display data
precisely unless data labels are added.

34
00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.200
Third, it is very easy to include several
different variables with different

35
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.189
units of measurement.

36
00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.460
Finally, you can combine summary and

37
00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.690
the detailed information in a table, which
is not always possible to do in graphs.

38
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.040
This table shows several different but
related variables nicely in a table.

39
00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.120
It includes units sold,
sales a month, and a market share.

40
00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.230
Notice that it is three variables
are in different units.

41
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.390
If we were to display this
information using graphs,

42
00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.790
we may have to use multiple graphs.

43
00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.480
Our focus in this module are data graphs.

44
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.870
Graphs have several
advantages of their own,

45
00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.850
which explains why they are very popular.

46
00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.850
First, graphs can present
patterns of the data,

47
00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.910
something that's really
difficult to do with tables.

48
00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.400
Because of that, graphs can also make
it easy to see the similarities and

49
00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.530
differences between
multiple sets of values.

50
00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.800
Finally, graphs can display large data
sets in a way that can be readily

51
00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.316
perceived and understood.

52
00:02:55.316 --> 00:03:01.120
A table with values becomes very
difficult to display and understand.

53
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.140
The same is not true for graphs.

54
00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.990
In fact, in the era of big data,

55
00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:10.680
graphs sometimes are generated from
millions or even billions of data points.

56
00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.160
Many expert actually believes that

57
00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.080
data visualization can be the last
step of analytics project

58
00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.820
if it is sufficiently displays
the interesting aspect of the data.

59
00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.600
To further contrast tables and
graphs, it is helpful to

60
00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.600
think about several scenarios for the
sales data example we discussed before.

61
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.670
What if there are sales data for
multiple products that we need to display?

62
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.100
This typical is not a problem for tables.

63
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.375
We can simply add a few
columns to the table.

64
00:03:38.375 --> 00:03:41.190
We may also do the same with graphs.

65
00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.705
However, the task is trickier.

66
00:03:43.705 --> 00:03:47.538
To start with, even one product will
potentially need multiple graphs, which

67
00:03:47.538 --> 00:03:51.960
means that information can be a little
more scattered if we choose to use graphs.

68
00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.331
Well, we can certainly display
multiple products on each graph,

69
00:03:55.331 --> 00:03:59.421
and it may not work well if the scale of
the numbers is substantially different for

70
00:03:59.421 --> 00:04:01.400
the different products.

71
00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.180
What if sales for
one product is in billions,

72
00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.068
whereas the other one is only in millions?

73
00:04:06.068 --> 00:04:10.770
That is not to say that tables
are not always their own limitations.

74
00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:14.880
If we have ten years of data, then we're
going to have a very long table and

75
00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.600
it is probably not feasible anymore.

76
00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.430
Displaying the information graphically
is only feasible method in that case.

77
00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.380
A graph can also reveal patterns
that are hard to discover in tables,

78
00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.420
such as sales trend and seasonality.

79
00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:33.610
Text, graphs, and
tables are not mutually exclusive.

80
00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.220
We can often combine them.

81
00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:36.100
For example, for

82
00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.160
really large datasets we can use graphs
to show patterns in the data, and

83
00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.548
use tables for summary information,
possibly on multiple measurements.

84
00:04:44.548 --> 00:04:48.252
We can then use text to
emphasize individual values or

85
00:04:48.252 --> 00:04:50.900
explain complex patterns and ideas.
