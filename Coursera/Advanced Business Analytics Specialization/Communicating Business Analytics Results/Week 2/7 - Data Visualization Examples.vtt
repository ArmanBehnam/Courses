00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.220
Before moving on further in the module,

2
00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.560
lets take a look at some
examples of data visualization.

3
00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.600
These visualizations comes from different
sources, including the Web and News Media,

4
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.040
mostly newspapers.

5
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.950
Most of the examples are not
ideal visualizations and

6
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.500
can be improve upon in
many different ways.

7
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.320
As I show those examples,
it would be helpful for

8
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.860
you to think about the good and
the bad about each of the graph.

9
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.100
We will come back to many of those
examples later in the module to

10
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.280
use them as contact for our discussion.

11
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.208
This video is based on [INAUDIBLE] survey.

12
00:00:32.208 --> 00:00:36.620
It illustrate the gap between how
millennials describe themselves and

13
00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.140
how HR professional describe them.

14
00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.680
At first sight,
this video is quite interesting.

15
00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.905
But can you spot any issues with it?

16
00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.130
Your first instinct would probably
be to read it as part of a whole.

17
00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.510
But clearly,
the percentages don't add up to 100%.

18
00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.510
So the shading can be based on percentage
of the speaker figure's surface area.

19
00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.180
This might mean it's based on height or
distance.

20
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.210
Similar to a map legend, for
instance, a half inch would equal 1%,

21
00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.940
but even that is ambiguous, because how
tall is this [INAUDIBLE] figure really?

22
00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.220
The shading might be completely arbitrary,
and

23
00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.990
gets especially confusing when
the visualization splits up the shading.

24
00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.030
In addition to all of this,
there are also type of comments.

25
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.171
The purpose is completely unclear.

26
00:01:27.171 --> 00:01:30.338
Does it makes the message more compelling?

27
00:01:30.338 --> 00:01:35.292
This graph is a 3D bar graph for the
Worldwide Revenue of the analytics company

28
00:01:35.292 --> 00:01:38.605
SaaS, and its research and
development spending.

29
00:01:38.605 --> 00:01:40.896
Can you suggest any improvement?

30
00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.066
What about this one?

31
00:01:46.066 --> 00:01:49.543
This graph represents where
your tax dollars would go and

32
00:01:49.543 --> 00:01:54.469
to see what portion of the federal budget
is dedicated to different program areas

33
00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:58.036
under President Obama's
proposed budget for 2016.

34
00:01:58.036 --> 00:02:01.530
The original video is found on
the official White House website.

35
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.900
This type of graph is called a tree map.

36
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.170
The main challenge with this graph is
that comparison is very difficult.

37
00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.930
In order to compare two figures,

38
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:15.650
we need to compare the areas of two rough
angles, which is not easy for most people.

39
00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.160
It is also unclear whether there's any
meaning to the coloring scheme either.

40
00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.370
This visualization is from
the USA Today website.

41
00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.280
Do you know what type of graph it is?

42
00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.130
When I first looked at it,

43
00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.019
it took me ten seconds to figure out
that the graphic was a line graph.

44
00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.070
My eyes immediately went to
the picture of the house.

45
00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.380
Placing a picture of a house on top of
the graph make the boundaries of the graph

46
00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:47.140
difficult to discern, especially since
they are similar in color to the house.

47
00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.360
The data increment lines on
the y-axis even go beyond the house.

48
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.805
It would have been helpful to use
a different color for the x and

49
00:02:54.805 --> 00:02:56.935
the y-axis increments on the lines.

50
00:02:56.935 --> 00:03:01.516
Additionally, it remains clear as to
why the house changes color above

51
00:03:01.516 --> 00:03:02.593
the trendline.

52
00:03:02.593 --> 00:03:05.389
Finally, without a description
in the upper-left column,

53
00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:06.688
this graph is meaningless.

54
00:03:06.688 --> 00:03:12.040
Neither the x-axis nor the y-axis
are labeled with titles or have units.

55
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.242
The x-axis could be determined to
be yeras without a description,

56
00:03:16.242 --> 00:03:18.538
while the y-axis remains unclear.

57
00:03:18.538 --> 00:03:22.759
Overall, this data visualization needs
to be redesigned to better convey

58
00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:23.567
its message.

59
00:03:23.567 --> 00:03:26.630
This is an interesting example for
data visualization,

60
00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.010
which was created on purpose by
the Americans United for Life,

61
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.844
as a propaganda piece
against Planned Parenthood.

62
00:03:32.844 --> 00:03:35.266
Can you spot any issues with the graph?

63
00:03:37.492 --> 00:03:40.160
We will discuss this graph in
a little more details later.
