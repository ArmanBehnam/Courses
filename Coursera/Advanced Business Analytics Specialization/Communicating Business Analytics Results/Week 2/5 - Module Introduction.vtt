00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.190
A picture is worth a thousand words.

2
00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.630
Graphs are widely used to illustrate and
to communicate.

3
00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.800
In this module we focus on graphical
ways of representing data.

4
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.980
With the help of commonly available
software such as eupcrators Excel,

5
00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.550
creating a graph from data
is almost effortless.

6
00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.470
Unfortunately, that does not
mean that creating a graph

7
00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.570
especially a good one is easy.

8
00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.830
Often times, the graphs created using
default options in software packages

9
00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.950
are confusing, effective,
or even misleading.

10
00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.760
Even though we all realize the importance
of creating effective graphs

11
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.710
most people receive little
training on how to achieve that.

12
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.610
At the University of Colorado Boulder I
have been teaching a course on data

13
00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.940
analytics for Master's students
in business analytics and

14
00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.490
MBA students in the last several years.

15
00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.494
Which includes a module
on data validation.

16
00:00:46.494 --> 00:00:49.300
I briefly touched upon some
of the material cover there

17
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.680
in second course of this specialization in
the context of exploratory data analysis.

18
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.030
In this module I dive
deeper to further discuss

19
00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.272
how to create effective
data visualizations.

20
00:01:00.272 --> 00:01:04.030
I will start with the different vehicles
to present the quantitative information.

21
00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.300
Note that a graph is not
the only way to present data.

22
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.073
There are alternative ways,
such as tables and text.

23
00:01:10.073 --> 00:01:12.690
I will discuss the pros and cons of each.

24
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.840
I will continue with a set of
examples of data visualizations

25
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.840
farmed from various sources.

26
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.010
Most of the examples we'll discuss
are not considered good visualizations.

27
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.310
We will talk about what are some of
the good and bad aspects of this examples.

28
00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.620
Understanding what makes a graph good or

29
00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.190
bad is the first step toward creating
effective data visualizations yourself.

30
00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.131
While there is growing area
of data visualization tools,

31
00:01:36.131 --> 00:01:39.230
Excel remains one of
the most widely used tools.

32
00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.810
We will briefly discuss graphs
that are available in Excel.

33
00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.850
Analytical server platform, software
that we introduced in course two comes

34
00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.070
with some additional graphing tools
which we will also briefly discuss.

35
00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.990
Creating effective data visualizations
have been a topic of study for many years.

36
00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.860
Over the years,

37
00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.450
many commonly accepted principles of
data visualizations have been developed.

38
00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.690
In the video Graphical Excellence,
we discussed some of those principles.

39
00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.190
Those guiding principles are extremely
helpful when we construct our own graphs.

40
00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.050
2D graphs usually can only
display two variables at a time.

41
00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.480
There are situations when it makes sense
to display three or more variables.

42
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.980
We will discuss several useful
techniques for those cases.

43
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.890
Finally, we discuss Excel
charts that should be avoided.

44
00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.980
After completing this module
you will be able to better

45
00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.560
understand the characteristics
of good graphs and

46
00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.860
avoid common mistakes when
creating your own graphs.

47
00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:34.574
Let's get started.
