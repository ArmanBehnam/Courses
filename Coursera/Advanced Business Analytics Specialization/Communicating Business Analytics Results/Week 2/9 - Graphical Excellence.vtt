00:00:00.114 --> 00:00:03.930
A lot can be learned from experts
on how to produce effective videos.

2
00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:05.780
Many books were written on the topic.

3
00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.540
In this video, we discuss
several important principles for

4
00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.100
effective data validation.

5
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.630
According to one of the world's leading
experts on data validation Edward Craft,

6
00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:16.780
a data graph should show the data and

7
00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.430
induce the viewer to think
about the substance.

8
00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.680
In order to achieve this,
he introduced the concept of data ink.

9
00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.034
The idea is that a large share of ink
on a graph should present the data.

10
00:00:28.034 --> 00:00:31.186
The share of Data-Ink is compared
in Ratio which is defined as

11
00:00:31.186 --> 00:00:34.960
the Data-Ink divided by total
ink used to print the graph.

12
00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.190
Here is an example graph
that we discussed before,

13
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.120
we have pointed out many
issues with this graph.

14
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.790
One that really stands out is the fact
that the Data-Ink Ratio is very low.

15
00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.500
Much of the ink used to print the graph
has nothing to do with the data.

16
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.138
In fact, it is quite difficult to pick
out the data mine at first sight.

17
00:00:54.138 --> 00:00:57.380
Even though adding the images of the house
in the background makes the graph more

18
00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:58.930
interesting in some way.

19
00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.580
It is actually a distracting in the end.

20
00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.570
In this 3D effects on graphs also
decreases the Data-Ink Ratio.

21
00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.670
Typically, it's 3D effects makes
really in a graph more difficult.

22
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.970
The third dimension in the graph does not
exist in the original data that makes

23
00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.860
comparing data values difficult.

24
00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.200
A graph should avoid distorting what the
data has to say, going back to 3D graphs.

25
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.870
In addition to having no Data-Ink Ratio,

26
00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.310
this should be avoided also
because it stores a graph.

27
00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.620
Our 3D perception is quite limited
compared to our 2D perception.

28
00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.670
In 3D, the size of the bar
depends on how far it is from us.

29
00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.090
We can make reading the values
likely very difficult.

30
00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.285
Despite their popularity, most experts
warn against using 3D effects for

31
00:01:42.285 --> 00:01:43.700
data graphs.

32
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.230
Pie charts should be avoided for
the same reason.

33
00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:48.370
Which slice is big in this pie chart?

34
00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.800
In fact, all six slices looks about
the same in the pie chart shown here.

35
00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.160
Hiowever, when it plotted the same
data using the Pareto bar chart.

36
00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.650
B is the largest under
the substantially bigger than B.

37
00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.140
Because of this [INAUDIBLE] in difficulty,

38
00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.830
most experts recommend that we
avoid the pie chart altogether.

39
00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.429
A graph should maintain visual
correspondence to quantity.

40
00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.190
This pie chart is the photograph created
by Excel that plotted the same data as

41
00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.558
the previous pie graph.

42
00:02:17.558 --> 00:02:21.056
Noticed that as the graph shows
that B is more than twice than D,

43
00:02:21.056 --> 00:02:22.510
which we know is not true.

44
00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.830
The reason for this perception is because
the vertical axis does not start at zero.

45
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.570
Which needs to misleading
their perception.

46
00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.835
Starting axis of non-zero values
should avoided most of the time.

47
00:02:34.835 --> 00:02:39.918
At a corner ray, we should avoid graphs
that are forced viewers to compare areas.

48
00:02:39.918 --> 00:02:43.120
Here's a tree maps that I
showed in the previous video,

49
00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.810
can you figure out which one is bigger?

50
00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.420
Social security or [INAUDIBLE] events?

51
00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:48.900
Just like in pie chart,

52
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.750
area comparison in a tree map can
be challenging for most people.

53
00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.050
Here is another graph I showed
in data validation examples.

54
00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.650
Here, the misleading realization
is created on purpose.

55
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.820
It was created by Americans United for

56
00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.110
Life in a campaign against
Planned Parenthood.

57
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.540
Know that only starting and
ending year data is shown.

58
00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.580
And the data from the years
in between is not shown, so

59
00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.150
it appears that there is an upper
linear trend of abortion.

60
00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.730
A massive downward linear trend for
cancer screenings and prevention services.

61
00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.380
On the y axis, there are two series
of data with the same units.

62
00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.880
The number of people served
by planned parenthood, but

63
00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.220
each series is plot on a different scale.

64
00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.650
This is down to hide the real information.

65
00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.090
And to make a point about abortion
services are increasing and

66
00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.650
the number of cancer screenings and
preventive services are decreasing.

67
00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.540
The title mentions abortions up,
life savings procedures down,

68
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.730
which is redundant as that is what they
are attempting to show in the graph.

69
00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.732
This chart looks at the same data
source as the first chart above, but

70
00:03:54.732 --> 00:03:58.392
instead of hiding the data it
shows all the services provided by

71
00:03:58.392 --> 00:04:01.240
Planned Parenthood from 2006 to 2013.

72
00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.784
And they use one scale on axis to clearly
show the number of people served over

73
00:04:05.784 --> 00:04:07.320
the years.

74
00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:11.940
This is an example of a good visualization
and it clearly shows the services and

75
00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.610
the trend with a simple line graph.

76
00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:18.213
The graph has a high data-ink ratio,
labeling this down appropriately

77
00:04:18.213 --> 00:04:20.765
without the need of a legend and
the title is clear.

78
00:04:21.995 --> 00:04:25.845
I've shown but a sample of data
visualizations principles.

79
00:04:25.845 --> 00:04:28.696
There are many others out there
I choose not to focus on.

80
00:04:28.696 --> 00:04:33.005
I would command that you learn more
from other sources, books, websites,

81
00:04:33.005 --> 00:04:34.545
blogs, etc.

82
00:04:34.545 --> 00:04:38.625
Ultimately, you will develop
a strong taste and keen eye for

83
00:04:38.625 --> 00:04:40.900
great data visualizations.

84
00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:48.549
You will also be able to improve your own
data validation when it is called for.
