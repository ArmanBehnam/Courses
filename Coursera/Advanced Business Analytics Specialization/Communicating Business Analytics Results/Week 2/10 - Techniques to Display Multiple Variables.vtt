00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:03.491
One of the big limitations of
two-dimensional graphs is that

2
00:00:03.491 --> 00:00:06.718
a single graph ussually can
only display two variables.

3
00:00:06.718 --> 00:00:09.520
There are times that when it's necessary
to display multiple variables.

4
00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.198
In this video, we discuss a few
techniques to do just that.

5
00:00:13.198 --> 00:00:17.369
I should emphasize from the off side that,
displaying more than two variables

6
00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.140
on one graph can make understanding and
interpreting the graph more challenging.

7
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.600
So before deciding on this path,

8
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.700
you should determine whether
it is indeed necessary.

9
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.280
Sometimes, a better approach is to use
multiple graphs arranged together to

10
00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.870
display multiple variables, which
are typically called Small Multiples.

11
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.030
We will briefly mention
them in this video as well.

12
00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.220
Let me start with a familiar
example of scatter plot.

13
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.360
As we know, one limitation
of a scatter plot is that it

14
00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.448
only displays the relationship
between a pair of variables.

15
00:00:47.448 --> 00:00:51.400
However, there are ways to add in more
data by creative use of color and

16
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.440
bubbles and et cetera.

17
00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.110
This graph shows a murders
per 1,000 population

18
00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.980
versus burglaries per 1,000
population in the year 2002.

19
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.260
And it can be seen that
the two are highly correlated.

20
00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.020
Can we add a third-dimension to the graph?

21
00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.230
The answer is yes, there are several
different ways, for example,

22
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:15.010
you can choose to color code the points in
the scatter plot based on some criteria.

23
00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.330
Sometimes color intensity
is used to encode data.

24
00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.730
For example,
we can choose to use a default color for

25
00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.490
data points that are from
a state with larger population.

26
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.530
Another way is to resize the data
point based on other data column

27
00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.600
which is what we did here.

28
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.346
Here the size of the circle is used
to encode the population size.

29
00:01:34.346 --> 00:01:38.880
This plot is referred to
as bubble plot in Excel.

30
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.935
But add in a certain variable population
to this graph, we see that the states

31
00:01:43.935 --> 00:01:47.650
with larger population also tend to have
higher murder rate and burglary rate.

32
00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.473
This insight cannot be easily shown if
we did not have the third dimension in

33
00:01:52.473 --> 00:01:52.999
the data.

34
00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.590
It should be mentioned that the graph with
a third dimension is harder to understand.

35
00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.030
So even though you can
add a third dimension,

36
00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.310
you should only do it when
it absolutely necessary.

37
00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.730
Another use for technique when displaying
multiple variables is to use a secondary

38
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:10.380
vertical axis.

39
00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.290
This can be useful, for example, when the
scale of the variables are different or

40
00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.770
the measurement unit is different.

41
00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.910
This graph shows a murder rate and
burglary rate data in Excel.

42
00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.440
When we use a bar graph to display
the data, the murder rate data can

43
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.260
be hardly read as the burglary
rate data is much larger in scale.

44
00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.170
This issue can be solved by adding
a secondary vertical access and

45
00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.210
changing the chart type of
burglary rate from bars to a line.

46
00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.768
Sometimes using multiple side by side
plots is preferred to showing all data in

47
00:02:41.768 --> 00:02:45.650
the same graph,
we call such a design a small multiples.

48
00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.681
Perhaps the most well-known
small multiples design is a side

49
00:02:48.681 --> 00:02:52.870
by side boxplot which are commonly used to
compare distributions for related data.

50
00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:59.130
We can also have side by side histograms,
bar charts or scatter plots as well.

51
00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.120
They are usually quite effective for
comparison.

52
00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.423
With that aspect of small multiple design,

53
00:03:04.423 --> 00:03:08.407
we need to ensure that the graphs are
consistent, arranged in a right way for

54
00:03:08.407 --> 00:03:11.800
easy comparison,
I mean the right sequence.

55
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:17.602
By consistency, we mean that the graphs
should have the same chart type,

56
00:03:17.602 --> 00:03:20.800
axis scale, color scheme, et cetera.

57
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.800
In consistence graph in a small
multiple can be confusing and

58
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.650
difficult to understand.

59
00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.835
One common issue is that, by default,

60
00:03:27.835 --> 00:03:32.490
Excel does not use the same axis
ranges when we create multiple graphs.

61
00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:36.390
We therefore need to manually
change the axis ranges to match.

62
00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.480
Otherwise, our side by side graph
might leave a wrong weird impression.

63
00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.710
The graphs should also
be arranged in a way so

64
00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:45.980
that the intended comparison
can be easily done.

65
00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.147
One of the primary decision is whether
to arrange the graphs horizontally or

66
00:03:49.147 --> 00:03:50.780
vertically.

67
00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.690
You might have to try
several different layouts.

68
00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.420
Finally, the graphs should
be sequenced properly.

69
00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.880
Typically, the graphs are linked
by an index variable, for example,

70
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.270
age group, gender, et cetera.

71
00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:05.160
Sometimes, there is
a natural order to follow.

72
00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.855
In the case of age groups, it is common
to order from the youngest to the oldest.

73
00:04:08.855 --> 00:04:11.677
Not following this order
can cause confusion.
