00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.280
Excel is a very popular
tool to create graphs.

2
00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:08.280
In addition, ASP comes with a set
of graphical tools for data graphs.

3
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.220
In this video, we briefly
discuss graphs in Excel and ASP.

4
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:17.020
We also take this opportunity to discuss
common ways to encode numerical values and

5
00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.290
compare them.

6
00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:22.110
In the second course of this
specialization we discussed six graphs for

7
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.380
exploratory data analysis.

8
00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.570
For categorical data, we introduced
the bar graphs and pie charts.

9
00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:35.060
For quantitative data, we introduced
histograms, boxplots and timeplots.

10
00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.500
In addition,
we also introduced scatter plot as a way

11
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.340
to examine relationships between
a pair of quantitative variables.

12
00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.265
Excel does not include queues for
all these graphs,

13
00:00:45.265 --> 00:00:50.620
in particular histograms and boxplots
cannot be easily created in Excel,

14
00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.170
even though it is possible to create them
by following some carefully planned steps.

15
00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.710
The graphing tools in ASP
can create all these graphs.

16
00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.010
Excel comes with many other graphs
that were not mentioned before,

17
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.140
such as tree map, pivot chart,
waterfall chart, and the win/loss graph.

18
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.000
We choose not to discuss
them in detail here.

19
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.895
Several additional graphs are available
in ASP, including histograms and

20
00:01:13.895 --> 00:01:16.020
boxplots I mentioned earlier.

21
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.530
Even though, I choose not to go into
details, I suggest that you explore them.

22
00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.840
If you are reasonably comfortable
with creating graphs in Excel,

23
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.940
creating graphs in ASP
should be easy to master.

24
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.727
An important decision with creating graphs
in Excel is the way to encode data.

25
00:01:31.727 --> 00:01:36.175
There are many alternatives
including points, lines,

26
00:01:36.175 --> 00:01:39.890
bars, boxes, shapes, and color intensity.

27
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.310
Points are also use to represent
a single value as in a dot plot or

28
00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.140
pair of values as in a scatter plot.

29
00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.040
Lines are primarily used for two purposes.

30
00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.700
First, it can be used to collect
individual values, second,

31
00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.920
it can also be used to
display overall pattern.

32
00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.400
An important example is the trend
line in a scatter plot.

33
00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.050
Bars are typically used to
represent a single value.

34
00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.070
Note that even though bars are two
dimensional objects with both height and

35
00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.880
width, one of the dimensions, the width is
typically not used to encode a data value.

36
00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.640
Boxes are often used to
represent ranges of values.

37
00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.650
The most well known example is a boxplot.

38
00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.580
It is also possible to use
shapes represent single values.

39
00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.500
For example,
a larger circle represent a bigger value.

40
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.580
Finally, it is also possible to use color
intensity to represent a single values.

41
00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.584
Usually, darker colors are used
to represent higher value.

42
00:02:38.584 --> 00:02:39.890
And the last two, shapes and

43
00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.460
color intensity are four last
common in the first four.

44
00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.680
Now, let me discuss two examples

45
00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.220
to illustrate the concentrations when
choosing the way to encode data.

46
00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.090
The first example concerns
time series data.

47
00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.900
Here, I show the same time series
data using three different ways

48
00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.260
to enclose the data values.

49
00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.305
Points are using the first one.

50
00:03:02.305 --> 00:03:06.450
Bars are using the second one and
the lines are using the last one.

51
00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:07.620
Which one is better?

52
00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.779
Experts often suggest that
we avoid using points.

53
00:03:12.779 --> 00:03:17.280
Well, bar and lines can both be
appropriate they serve different purposes.

54
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.050
Bars are often used when we want
to emphasize individual values and

55
00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.900
the lines are used when we
want to emphasize a trend.

56
00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.890
Here's the rationale for
the recommendation.

57
00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.300
Points have small visual weight and

58
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.560
do not help show the sequential
nature of the time series data.

59
00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.220
Bars have large visual weight and
make individual values stand out.

60
00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.850
Finally, adding a line
helps correct the issue.

61
00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.360
Therefore, depending on
the purpose of our graph

62
00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.150
we should carefully choose
the type of graph we use.

63
00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.120
In Excel, if we want to use bars
we need to choose bar graph.

64
00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.370
If we want to use lines we
need to choose line graph.

65
00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.070
Our second example concerns graphs
used to show distribution of data.

66
00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:07.600
Recall that a distribution shows how a set
of data spreads across the entire range.

67
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.850
You can choose to use several
different ways to encode the data.

68
00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:14.990
If we use points the graph is
typically called strip plot.

69
00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:17.590
If we use lines,
the graph is called density curve.

70
00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:22.140
If we use bars,
the graph is called histogram.

71
00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.150
Finally, if we use boxes,
the graph is called boxplot.

72
00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.290
Note that the different ways to show
distribution have different strengths.

73
00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.390
The strip plot uses points.

74
00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:35.370
It is great for
showing individual values in the data set.

75
00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.920
However, it becomes infeasible
when data set is relatively large.

76
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.210
The line in the density curve features
the shape of the distribution.

77
00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:48.690
The bars in the histogram naturally
shows the frequency of each interval

78
00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:49.710
within the data range.

79
00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.860
Boxplot is an exceptionally simple graph

80
00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.570
that features simple summary
statistics of the data.

81
00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:00.590
Which one we should choose
depends on the purpose.

82
00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.080
Therefore, histograms and
the boxplots are most popular.

83
00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.920
Histograms show a lot more
details than boxplots.

84
00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:13.119
However, boxplots can be great choice as
it succinctly summarizes a data set and

85
00:05:13.119 --> 00:05:18.178
are also great for side-by-side
comparison for several related data sets.
