00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.000
I would like to conclude this module with
some advice on Excel charts to avoid.

2
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.460
Given the ubiquity of Excel it
is highly susceptible to misuse.

3
00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.880
Excel offers an array of
options of different charts,

4
00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.330
unfortunately not all charts available
in Excel are effectively used for data.

5
00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.820
As a general rule any chart that does not
show data effectively should be avoided.

6
00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.909
To start with,
all 3D charts should be avoided.

7
00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:29.019
As we discussed in an earlier video,
3D display distorts the value of data and

8
00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:32.040
often leaves wrong visual impression.

9
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.600
In addition, since the 3rd dimension is
typically not based on data you have,

10
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.740
it can significantly
decrease the data ink ratio.

11
00:00:39.868 --> 00:00:43.080
We've also discussed before
that pie charts in general

12
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.840
should be avoided because it forces reader
to make difficult area comparisons.

13
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.440
That is,
comparing the area of the pie slices.

14
00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.770
Or in the same logic,
donut chart should also be avoided,

15
00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.690
that is just a variant of pie chart.

16
00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:02.010
Stacked area charts should be avoided
because it is difficult to understand and

17
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.130
interpret.

18
00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.858
In these sample stacked area chart
we are showing two data series.

19
00:01:06.858 --> 00:01:11.010
Notice that the pattern of the top data
series is quite difficult to discern

20
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.250
because it is stacked
above the bottom one.

21
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.110
In this particular example the first
impression is that there is

22
00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.810
an upward trend in this data series

23
00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.070
which turns out not to be true when
we examine the graphs more closely.

24
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.630
The upward trend we picked up is actually
from the data series in the bottom.

25
00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.840
This line graph shows
the same two data series.

26
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.130
From the line graph it is apparent that
one of the data series has an upward trend

27
00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.080
and the other one shows
a straight downward trend.

28
00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.830
This pattern is completely
lost in a stacked area chart.

29
00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.790
Because stacked area charts are typically
used to show variables on the same scale,

30
00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.870
we can almost always convert them
to line graphs as I did here.

31
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.410
Another very popular chart that is
not effective is stacked bar chart.

32
00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.960
It has same issues as stacked
area chart where the trend for

33
00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.180
all data series except
the bottom one is masked.

34
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.230
They too can often be
converted to line graphs.

35
00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.980
A couple of other charts that should
probably be avoided include radar chart,

36
00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:13.120
circle chart, funnel charts and
waterfall charts.

37
00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.690
This charts can be used for
exam situations but

38
00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.920
should be avoided most of the time.

39
00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.590
I could provide a much longer,
longer list of charts to avoid but

40
00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.750
it is perhaps more important to
remember that core principles.

41
00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.260
Any chart that does not show data
effectively should be avoided.

42
00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.272
Always ask yourself whether the chart
shows the data in the intended manner, and

43
00:02:33.272 --> 00:02:35.107
is easy to digest for your audience.
