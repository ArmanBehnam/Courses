00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.830
In this part of the course,
we've been talking about ways in which

2
00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:06.250
we failed to make correct
interpretations in our analysis.

3
00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:08.090
Some of these are related
to how we think and

4
00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.190
how we make assumptions and inferences.

5
00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.380
But we can also get ourselves into
trouble by choosing to show data and

6
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.150
results in a way that either doesn't
tell the whole story or worse,

7
00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:18.840
tells the wrong story entirely.

8
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.940
In this video, we're going to cover
a few common ways in which we distort

9
00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:23.780
information when we show
it in a certain way.

10
00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.950
The cases we'll talk
about are just examples.

11
00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:29.771
You'll find that we can be
incredibly creative at finding new

12
00:00:29.771 --> 00:00:30.809
ways to distort data.

13
00:00:30.809 --> 00:00:33.811
But these should give you a sense for
what to watch out for in your own work and

14
00:00:33.811 --> 00:00:34.871
that of your colleagues.

15
00:00:34.871 --> 00:00:38.460
The first one is what we like
to call the Lie of Averages.

16
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.690
We regularly use summary statistics
such as average, medians and

17
00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.480
variances to describe data.

18
00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.180
And in many circumstances that's
an entirely appropriate thing to do,

19
00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.400
but that's not always the case.

20
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.210
A great illustration of how
summary statistics can lead us to

21
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.970
some wrong conclusions is something
called Anscombe's quartet.

22
00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:00.290
Consider these four sets of data,
each set has ten pairs of x and y values.

23
00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.640
It turns out that this four sets of
data have almost identical statistical

24
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:04.162
properties.

25
00:01:04.162 --> 00:01:07.592
The average of the x values is = to 9.

26
00:01:07.592 --> 00:01:11.183
The average of the y values is = to 7.5.

27
00:01:11.183 --> 00:01:14.954
The variance in the x values is = to 11.

28
00:01:14.954 --> 00:01:21.000
The variance in the y values
is = to either 4.122 or 4.127.

29
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.504
The correlation between x and y is 0.816.

30
00:01:24.504 --> 00:01:29.821
And the equation of the linear
regression line calculated

31
00:01:29.821 --> 00:01:34.280
on each data set is y = 3.00 + 0.500x.

32
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.453
If all we have were these summary
statistics, we probably feel pretty

33
00:01:37.453 --> 00:01:42.020
comfortable concluding that these four
groups are basically the same, right?

34
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.649
But what happens when we actually plot
the data and look at it visually?

35
00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:47.615
Now, things don't look so similar.

36
00:01:47.615 --> 00:01:51.092
In fact, it looks like there are four
completely different patterns underlying

37
00:01:51.092 --> 00:01:52.020
the four data sets.

38
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.238
Armed with this information,

39
00:01:54.238 --> 00:01:57.360
we'd actually had a really hard time
concluding that the groups are the same.

40
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.290
The point here is that how
data is distributed can

41
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.310
really make a huge difference
in the conclusions we draw.

42
00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.390
This is particularly true in business.

43
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.420
The date we examine in the business
world often has very odd properties.

44
00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.579
We have outliers that are driven
not by random events, but

45
00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:15.071
by real process problems.

46
00:02:15.071 --> 00:02:19.037
We see distributions in real that data
that haves spikes, troughs and gaps.

47
00:02:19.037 --> 00:02:22.635
And we often encounter bimodal or
multimodal distributions that can be hard

48
00:02:22.635 --> 00:02:25.660
to adequately describe
using summary statistics.

49
00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.980
Here is a real world example
using some actual purchase data.

50
00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.620
Specifically, this data shows the number
of purchases in some period by price.

51
00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.822
This is an oddly shaped distribution.

52
00:02:35.822 --> 00:02:40.847
There are a number of peaks around
common values like 39.95 and 995.

53
00:02:40.847 --> 00:02:44.074
There appear to be some gaps
in some clusters of activity.

54
00:02:44.074 --> 00:02:47.751
Prices range from 0 to 479.95.

55
00:02:47.751 --> 00:02:51.628
How much insight will we gain simply
by looking at summary statistics?

56
00:02:51.628 --> 00:02:54.228
Now, we don't mean to suggest that
you shouldn't use averages and

57
00:02:54.228 --> 00:02:55.010
other statistics.

58
00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.453
Again, there are many cases
where that's just fine.

59
00:02:57.453 --> 00:03:00.387
But it's usually not a bad idea to at
least take a look at the distribution,

60
00:03:00.387 --> 00:03:02.560
to make sure you're not missing something.

61
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.110
So that's what we mean
by the Lie of Averages.

62
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.920
The second distortion we'll talk about
is what I refer to as Chart Myopia.

63
00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.124
Let's say we're in a regional
sales review meeting and

64
00:03:11.124 --> 00:03:13.112
the following data is presented.

65
00:03:13.112 --> 00:03:14.418
What do we see?

66
00:03:14.418 --> 00:03:18.373
Well, it looks like sales declined quite
a bit between May and August of 2016.

67
00:03:18.373 --> 00:03:20.249
We should probably figure
out what's going on and

68
00:03:20.249 --> 00:03:21.822
see if we l can reverse the trend, right?

69
00:03:21.822 --> 00:03:25.283
Well, not so fast, what's missing?

70
00:03:25.283 --> 00:03:29.290
If you said scale or
the y axis values, you're right.

71
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.010
Let's add that and
see how it changes the picture.

72
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.270
Okay, so this adds some perspective.

73
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.172
Sales haven't declined by half, but

74
00:03:36.172 --> 00:03:38.200
they've still gone down
three months in a row.

75
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:38.940
Maybe we should still

76
00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.560
figure out why that's happening
even if the decline is smaller.

77
00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:42.570
What do you think?

78
00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.682
Well, suppose we actually
use the same scale, but

79
00:03:45.682 --> 00:03:48.580
looked at the data over a wider
range of time like this.

80
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.321
When we look at the data
as part of a longer series,

81
00:03:52.321 --> 00:03:56.026
we see that there's actually quite
a bit of historical variation in sales.

82
00:03:56.026 --> 00:03:58.414
Now, it's not so
clear that there's a trend here at all.

83
00:03:58.414 --> 00:04:00.822
Maybe the decline happened
purely by chance.

84
00:04:00.822 --> 00:04:03.383
And in any case,
that shorter run of sales is more or

85
00:04:03.383 --> 00:04:06.075
less in line with the sales
we see over a wider period.

86
00:04:06.075 --> 00:04:07.839
You can probably see where this is going,
but

87
00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:10.129
let's take it a step further
just to drive the point home.

88
00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:12.776
Let's look at the complete
time series of data, but

89
00:04:12.776 --> 00:04:15.010
on a full y-axis scale
that starts at zero.

90
00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:18.804
This chart tells an entirely
different story.

91
00:04:18.804 --> 00:04:22.077
From this perspective, it looks like
there's no variation in sales at all.

92
00:04:22.077 --> 00:04:26.440
In fact, the sales trend looks completely
flat and remarkably consistent.

93
00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.450
If we'd have shown this
view first in our meeting,

94
00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:32.220
we'd have probably just move on to the
next agenda item without a second thought.

95
00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.700
So the point of Chart Myopia is that
if you zoom enough on anything,

96
00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.450
you can make insignificant
things look significant.

97
00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:40.810
Of course, the converse can also be true.

98
00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.610
As analysts, we should strive to show
things in a way that puts them in

99
00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.490
perspective and
shows them in the right context.

100
00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.860
Let's move on to the third and
last distortion we'll cover in this video.

101
00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.180
This one I'm going to call
the Disembodied Numerator distortion.

102
00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:56.200
Suppose we're a healthcare system, where
we're looking at the number of hospital

103
00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:00.660
acquired infections that occurred at each
of our hospitals over a period of time.

104
00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.390
This is considered to be a key measure of
quality in the delivery of health care.

105
00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:06.930
The lower the number of
infections the better.

106
00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.840
We gathered together the hospital
presidents to review the data, and

107
00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.710
we start with this chart.

108
00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:15.430
We immediately focused on Hospital B and
their high number of infections relative

109
00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.440
to the other hospitals,
especially Hospital A.

110
00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.894
We suggest that Hospital B study Hospital
A to learn what their doing to achieve

111
00:05:21.894 --> 00:05:23.330
better results.

112
00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:24.590
So, what's missing in this discussion?

113
00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.940
Well, while the number of infections
is important, we need to put it in

114
00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:32.050
the context of how many patients
were actually at the hospital.

115
00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.140
What were really should be asking is,
out of how many?

116
00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:37.210
So, let's add a little
information to our chart.

117
00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.911
Namely, the number of patient
admissions that happened over the same

118
00:05:39.911 --> 00:05:41.530
period of time.

119
00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:45.232
Now, we see that while Hospital B may have
had the highest number of infections,

120
00:05:45.232 --> 00:05:47.471
they also had the highest
number of admissions.

121
00:05:47.471 --> 00:05:50.998
Conversely, while Hospital A may have
had the lowest number of infections,

122
00:05:50.998 --> 00:05:53.177
they also had the lowest
number of admissions.

123
00:05:53.177 --> 00:05:56.640
So it's not quite as clear who's
really doing well and who's not.

124
00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:00.210
However, when we add the actual
infection rate to the chart,

125
00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:02.460
we start to get some meaningful insights.

126
00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.670
When we look at the infection
rate we see that Hospitals B and

127
00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:07.410
C are actually performing best.

128
00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:10.690
While Hospital A is the worst performer
with the highest infection rate,

129
00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:13.210
just the opposite of our
original conclusion.

130
00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:16.382
This might seem like a pretty obvious
example, but sometimes the impact

131
00:06:16.382 --> 00:06:19.670
of the Disembodied Numerator
problem is not as straightforward.

132
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:20.950
Here's a real example.

133
00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:23.540
In wireless companies,
the number of customers acquisitions and

134
00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:26.040
customers defections
are tracked very closely.

135
00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:29.080
In fact, it's not uncommon for
companies to have daily reports

136
00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:32.740
which break down these numbers by region,
customer type or product type.

137
00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:36.450
And these reports are used to monitor and
act on sales and retention tactics.

138
00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:38.710
A real company had such a report.

139
00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:41.913
And to avoid the Disembodied Numerator
problem, they not only reported

140
00:06:41.913 --> 00:06:45.694
the absolutely number of acquisition and
defections, but also the acquisition rate

141
00:06:45.694 --> 00:06:49.140
and the defection rate relative to
the size of the respective group.

142
00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:51.321
Again, region, customer type,
and product prototype.

143
00:06:51.321 --> 00:06:54.359
So periodically leadership would
observe a spike in defection rate and

144
00:06:54.359 --> 00:06:57.550
would quickly move to understand
what happened and fix it.

145
00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:00.850
This all sounds very reasonable,
except for one small nuance.

146
00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:03.958
The company in question had most
customers on two year contracts.

147
00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:06.890
This meant that if a customer
cancelled prior two years,

148
00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:08.940
they pay a significant penalty.

149
00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:11.050
So when do you think
customers did tend to cancel?

150
00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:15.250
If you said right after their
two years are up, you're right.

151
00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:18.210
In fact, if we were to look at
monthly cancellation rates by customer

152
00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:21.320
tenure in months,
we'd find something like this.

153
00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:25.000
Note the huge spike that happens
right after the 24 month point.

154
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.920
Let's think about our daily sales and
cancellation report.

155
00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:31.350
Suppose we recently had a really big
promotion that brought in larger than

156
00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:36.540
normal number of new customers, what would
we expect to see in about two years?

157
00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:40.500
That's right, we'd expect to see a larger
than normal number of cancellations.

158
00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:43.110
It turns out that while our company
thought they had accounted for

159
00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:46.330
the Disembodied Numerator distortion,
they really hadn't.

160
00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:50.235
We regularly discovered that causes of
spikes in cancellation rates were actually

161
00:07:50.235 --> 00:07:53.240
spikes in acquisitions that
happened two years ago.

162
00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:56.518
And more importantly this meant there
was really no problem to solve.

163
00:07:56.518 --> 00:07:59.869
The company would have been better
served looking at cancellations by

164
00:07:59.869 --> 00:08:03.177
tenure versus cancellations by region,
customer type or product.

165
00:08:03.177 --> 00:08:07.603
Using the wrong denominator can be just
as bad as having no denominator at all.

166
00:08:07.603 --> 00:08:11.750
The takeaway here is pretty simple,
always ask, out of how many?

167
00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:14.620
And try to include rates whenever
possible to present a clear and

168
00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:16.830
more complete picture of
what's really going on.

169
00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:18.220
As we said at the start of the video,

170
00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:20.920
we can be really creative
in how we distort data.

171
00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:24.770
However, we hope that by calling your
attention to a few common distortions,

172
00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:27.370
you'll be able to avoid
some presentation pitfalls.

173
00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:29.130
Let's quickly review what we covered.

174
00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:33.515
We learned about the Lie of Averages,
or how using only summery statistics can

175
00:08:33.515 --> 00:08:36.386
misrepresent the underlying
nuances of our data.

176
00:08:36.386 --> 00:08:38.235
We discussed Chart Myopia, or

177
00:08:38.235 --> 00:08:43.151
how our data can tell the wrong story if
we focus our visualizations too narrowly.

178
00:08:43.151 --> 00:08:47.759
And we explored the Disembodied Numerator
problem, where counts by themselves don't

179
00:08:47.759 --> 00:08:50.509
tell the whole story,
unless we ask out of how many.

180
00:08:50.509 --> 00:08:51.817
Hope you enjoyed the video.

181
00:08:51.817 --> 00:08:52.691
And we'll see you next time.
