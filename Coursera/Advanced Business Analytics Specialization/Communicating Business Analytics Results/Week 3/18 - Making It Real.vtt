00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.384
In this module, we speak quite a bit of
time learning about how to communicate

2
00:00:03.384 --> 00:00:05.660
the results for analysis to other people.

3
00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.860
We consider our audience and we explored
how we can use data to tell the right

4
00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.900
story and make our pitch for
what actions we should take in the market.

5
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.832
More often than not, we find ourselves
preparing specific materials for

6
00:00:14.832 --> 00:00:16.410
using the presentation.

7
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.490
For better or worse, the business world
is largely driven by slide presentations,

8
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.950
although we do have the opportunity to
use other formats from time to time.

9
00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:27.900
In any case, there are a few
structural principles you should

10
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.390
be familiar with as you
construct your materials.

11
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.230
We'll speak in terms of slides, but

12
00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.530
many of them are applicable
to other media as well.

13
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.200
We'll start with the principle that
goes completely counter to what is

14
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.390
generally taught.

15
00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.990
Specifically that the presentation
is not about you.

16
00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:43.930
It's about the problem
you're trying to solve.

17
00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.980
In public speaking or for presentations
at conferences or other large venues,

18
00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.690
it's generally accepted that slides
are only there to support the speaker.

19
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.810
Consequently, they should be sparse,
concise,

20
00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.650
and perhaps have only a few bullets or
simple diagrams.

21
00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.440
There's certainly no need for
a presentation to stand on its own.

22
00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.500
However, I'd argue that 90% or
more of the presentations that we actually

23
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.700
do in the real world rely on the slide
deck as the focus of the conversation.

24
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:08.610
And moreover,

25
00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.140
it serves as an artifact that can
be taken away by the participants.

26
00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.570
It's therefore much more likely that the
slide deck will need to stand on its own

27
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.270
without requiring talk over.

28
00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.000
Naturally, this means our slides need to
contain a bit more information than they

29
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.310
otherwise would.

30
00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.470
At the same time, we want to
avoid cramming our slides with so

31
00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.480
much information that they
can't be easily understood.

32
00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.320
As you might imagine, there's definitely
an art to making slides easy to interpret

33
00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.700
and allowing them to
tell a complete story.

34
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.490
The need to construct slides in this way
is one driver behind the 5 minute rule we

35
00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.430
introduced earlier in the course.

36
00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.980
By way of review,
the 5 minute rule suggests that

37
00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.700
each slide in the presentation will
occupy about 5 minutes of time.

38
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.330
This accounts for the time required for

39
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.830
the audience to absorb the information as
well as overall discussion and questions.

40
00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.040
In terms of overall slide deck
preparation, another principle

41
00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.650
we can apply is a variation on
something called the pyramid principle.

42
00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.158
The pyramid principle
suggests that writing and

43
00:02:02.158 --> 00:02:06.818
thinking can be structured to nest
supporting ideas under one common point.

44
00:02:06.818 --> 00:02:08.460
As we move toward the base of the pyramid,

45
00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.990
there are more granular
structures of supporting ideas.

46
00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.970
Let's consider our analytic process and

47
00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.050
the types of discussions we're
likely to have through that process.

48
00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.571
Presenting a various levels,
developing strategies and tactics for

49
00:02:20.571 --> 00:02:25.000
action with our colleagues, and ultimately
pitching our ideas to decision-makers.

50
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.170
Here we see a similar pyramid.

51
00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.220
Our executive is primarily
interested in the main point and

52
00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.685
maybe the first level of support.

53
00:02:31.685 --> 00:02:34.793
Next-level leaders often
want a bit more detail but

54
00:02:34.793 --> 00:02:38.500
may not want to walk through
every step of analysis.

55
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.130
And the working team maybe
interested in everything.

56
00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.115
If we're smart, we can construct one
layered set of presentation materials that

57
00:02:45.115 --> 00:02:47.630
satisfy the needs of all these groups.

58
00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.970
For example, we may construct a detailed
deck that has our entire process with

59
00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.470
analysis, results, and
actions laid out in order.

60
00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.680
We develop and
use this deck in our working sessions.

61
00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.860
We then prepare a shorter summary deck,

62
00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.630
typically 10 to 15 pages, which we
can use with mid-level leadership.

63
00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.406
In this presentation, we have our
longer deck available as an appendix.

64
00:03:09.406 --> 00:03:13.294
Finally, we construct a very short
executive summary, perhaps three to

65
00:03:13.294 --> 00:03:17.638
five pages, which captures the key
recommendation and main supporting points.

66
00:03:17.638 --> 00:03:21.242
In our executive readout, we include
the mid-level deck as an appendix, and

67
00:03:21.242 --> 00:03:24.968
we keep the larger deck in our back pocket
in case we have any detailed questions.

68
00:03:24.968 --> 00:03:27.236
You might also notice that if we do this,

69
00:03:27.236 --> 00:03:31.508
we have some very natural materials
to use in 30 minute, 60 minute, and

70
00:03:31.508 --> 00:03:34.690
longer meetings,
consistent with the 5 minute rule.

71
00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.660
So far, we've talked about
slide presentations as a whole.

72
00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.820
Let's spend a few minutes discussing
two principles that speak to how we

73
00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.690
may arrange facts or
statements in our presentations.

74
00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.930
The first is called the rule of three.

75
00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.650
The rule of three is essentially
the observation that we as

76
00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.600
humans find things grouped in threes
more appealing and more compelling.

77
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.728
Three is also a minimum number of elements
required to establish a pattern, and

78
00:03:56.728 --> 00:03:58.890
we implicitly pick up on that.

79
00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.045
The simplest way to apply the rule of
three in slides is to make sure that if

80
00:04:02.045 --> 00:04:05.990
we're using bullets point on the slide,
we have at least three of them.

81
00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:07.940
If we only have two things to list,

82
00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.670
we should probably consider just
combining them into a single point.

83
00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.920
This principle also applies to visuals and
diagrams.

84
00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.590
Images grouped in threes tend to
be more appealing to the viewer.

85
00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.790
Another way we use the rule of
three is in providing options.

86
00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.930
It turns out that people also like to have
at least three options to choose from and

87
00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.460
will often end up choosing the one
that's in the middle, so to speak.

88
00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.150
A pretty common trick is to present two
options that we know people won't like

89
00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.130
along with a more palatable one
we actually want them to pick.

90
00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.380
However, it turns out that while
we like to have enough options,

91
00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.575
we have all sorts of problems when
presented with too many choices.

92
00:04:46.575 --> 00:04:49.820
There's are a ton of behavioral search
out there that shows how we can become

93
00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:54.350
overloaded and can make bad decisions in
the presence of too much information.

94
00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:57.840
One of the foundational ideas in this
research is based on a paper published by

95
00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:03.100
psychologist George R Miller in 1956
titled The Magic Number Seven Plus or

96
00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:07.420
Minus Two, Some Limits on Our Capacity for
Processing Information.

97
00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:10.800
The common interpretation of Miller's
research is that on average,

98
00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.520
people can hold about seven items in their
short term memory, give or take a couple.

99
00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.190
Sometimes this is referred
to as Miller's Law.

100
00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:22.060
What this means for us is that we should
probably limit any list of items we want

101
00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.610
people to retain mentally to
somewhere between five and nine.

102
00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:28.580
And as a practical matter,
fewer is probably better.

103
00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:33.391
Some research even suggest that certain
tasks become more difficult when as little

104
00:05:33.391 --> 00:05:34.856
as five elements are involved.

105
00:05:34.856 --> 00:05:37.720
That having been said,
we are writing these things down,

106
00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.440
so we're not always asking people
to remember the list itself.

107
00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.700
So its okay to include
longer list on our slides.

108
00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.692
But if we're walking through a set
of ideas in a presentation, and

109
00:05:47.692 --> 00:05:49.938
we want people to stay with
us from slide to slide,

110
00:05:49.938 --> 00:05:52.650
we should keep this
cognitive limits in mind.

111
00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:57.200
So to summarize, the upshot of listing is
that having three to five items is better.

112
00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.850
Fewer is bad, four is risky but
okay in some cases.

113
00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:04.451
The last principle we'll discuss is that
when it comes to preparing presentation

114
00:06:04.451 --> 00:06:07.610
materials, quality and
attention to detail matter.

115
00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:10.820
Right or wrong, your audience will
implicitly use the quality of your

116
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:14.010
materials as a proxy for
the quality of your analysis.

117
00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:18.180
If your deck is sloppy, they'll tend
to assume your analysis was sloppy.

118
00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:20.930
A prestine deck won't sell
your analysis by itself, but

119
00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:23.460
it can certainly help show
you you're on your game.

120
00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:27.388
This is particularly important if all the
people in the room are not friendly, so

121
00:06:27.388 --> 00:06:27.922
to speak.

122
00:06:27.922 --> 00:06:31.780
The last thing you want to do is give
anyone a reason to take you off track.

123
00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:34.930
Luckily, there are some things you can
do to help make sure your deck doesn't

124
00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:36.540
become a distraction.

125
00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:39.950
By far, the most important is making
sure your numbers are correct.

126
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:43.890
I've seen many presentations get derailed
quickly by a typo in a key value or

127
00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:45.160
a calculation.

128
00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:49.805
One bad number can immediately call into
question every finding of your analysis.

129
00:06:49.805 --> 00:06:52.880
While less critical, it goes without
saying that things like spelling and

130
00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:56.350
grammar should be checked thoroughly,
especially if there are any names or

131
00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:58.550
titles listed in the presentation.

132
00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:01.780
Other ways your deck can signal
quality are a bit more subtle.

133
00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:04.750
A lot of them have to do with
consistency and formatting.

134
00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:07.399
There are many perspectives of how
a deck should be formatted, but

135
00:07:07.399 --> 00:07:11.170
we'll provide one perspective here and
outline some rules that we follow.

136
00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:14.360
At a minimum, they should get you thinking
about how you want to signal quality with

137
00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:15.620
your materials.

138
00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:19.470
First, use a standard or
at least consistent slide template.

139
00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:22.570
The presentation should have the same
look and feel all the way through and

140
00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:26.430
flow as though it were prepared
by one person, even if it wasn't.

141
00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:30.540
Second, use a consistent font, and
ideally, a consistent size for

142
00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:32.840
similar types of text across slides.

143
00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:35.640
Bullet points at the same level
should use the same font and

144
00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:38.970
the same bullet format throughout
the slide presentation.

145
00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:39.630
Third.

146
00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:42.080
If possible,
try to have charts, graphs, and

147
00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:44.470
tables using the same style and colors.

148
00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:47.570
And at minimum, make sure that
if you use a specific color for

149
00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:52.900
an idea on one slide, use the same color
for the same idea on another slide.

150
00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:57.370
Fourth, slide title should be in
the exact same position on each slide.

151
00:07:57.370 --> 00:08:00.210
Bullets should start the same distance
from the left-hand side of the page

152
00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:01.490
across slides.

153
00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:04.890
Fifth, never stretch a picture and
change its aspect ratio,

154
00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:06.470
it almost always looks bad.

155
00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:10.890
And finally, use spacing for
visual appeal.

156
00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:14.457
Try to balance content on the page and
visually separate ideas.

157
00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:20.980
This may seem like a lot of work for
something that's largely administrative.

158
00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:23.940
But like most things, the more you do it,
the more natural it will be, and

159
00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:25.690
the more efficient you'll become.

160
00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:29.670
Preparing slide materials is not glamorous
work, but if it helps you get your message

161
00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:33.830
across more clearly and efficiently with
less distractions, it's time well spent.

162
00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:37.660
So to wrap up, let's quickly review
the principles we learned in this video.

163
00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:41.240
We learned that more often than not,
the presentation is not about you.

164
00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:43.460
Allow your slides to stand on their own.

165
00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:44.950
We reviewed the 5 minute rule,

166
00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:48.070
which helps you size your deck to
the time you have for a meeting.

167
00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:51.450
We saw how the pyramid principle can
help us structure a set of presentation

168
00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:53.850
materials for multiple audiences.

169
00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:58.060
We discussed the rule of three and the
magic number seven plus or minus two and

170
00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:01.468
how they can be used to enumerate
discussion points or decision options.

171
00:09:01.468 --> 00:09:05.800
Finally, we emphasize the important of
quality in our slide presentations and

172
00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:09.970
provide a number of specifics rules and
checks for developing high quality decks.

173
00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:13.347
With these ideas in mind, you'll be
well-prepared to deliver your pitch and

174
00:09:13.347 --> 00:09:15.505
get the outcome you want
from your presentation.
