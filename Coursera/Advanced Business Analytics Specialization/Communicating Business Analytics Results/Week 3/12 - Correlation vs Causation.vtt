00:00:05.969 --> 00:00:07.620
Welcome back.

2
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.830
The question of why things happen is at
the core of just about everything we do

3
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.100
in analytics.

4
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.420
Whether we're looking at what happened in
the past, what will happen in the future,

5
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.880
or what we should do about it,

6
00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.440
it's in our nature to seek to
understand what's really going on.

7
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.040
We want to know why.

8
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.020
We want to know what cause
something to happen or

9
00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.100
what will cause something to happen.

10
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.110
Not only does that knowledge help us
today, but it helps grow our understanding

11
00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.580
of how things work and
informs how we think about our business.

12
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.550
However, the real world is complicated and
really

13
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.700
understanding the causes of the events
we see is much easier said than done.

14
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.420
In this video, we're going to talk about
the ideas of correlation and causation and

15
00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.900
address one of the most common errors
that occurs in analytical work,

16
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.390
specifically mistaking one for the other.

17
00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.210
So what is correlation?

18
00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.350
In the simplest terms,
correlation is a mutual connection or

19
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.760
relationship between two or more things.

20
00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.480
When we think about correlation in
analytics we're usually referring to how

21
00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.780
we see characteristics vary in
relationship to each other.

22
00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.790
When one measure is higher or lower does
another measure vary in a consistent or

23
00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.310
predictable way?

24
00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.100
If so
we'd say the measures are correlated.

25
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.700
The simplest way we normally see
correlation is when we plot the values of

26
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.100
one measure or variable versus another.

27
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.300
Here's an example.

28
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.880
Here we have a plot of average
height versus average weight for

29
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.390
women in the United States.

30
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.580
As we might expect as height increases so
does weight.

31
00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.490
In fact, the relationship between the two
almost looks like a straight line or

32
00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.060
what we call a linear relationship.

33
00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.200
However, there are number of regular and

34
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.210
irregular patterns we might see
when looking for relationships.

35
00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.800
Here are a few.

36
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.470
Some of these are positive correlations,
like the log, exponential, power, and

37
00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:46.990
logistic patterns.

38
00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.880
In these patterns, when one value
goes up the other value also goes up.

39
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.740
Some are negative correlations,
like the negative linear and

40
00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.680
negative exponential pattern.

41
00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.000
In these patterns when one value
goes up the other value goes down.

42
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.610
And the others are more complicated.

43
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.140
The quadratic, threshold step, and

44
00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.250
cyclical patterns all suggest
a relationship between the two values.

45
00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.230
When we're dealing with data in
the real world the relationships we see

46
00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.380
aren't this clean.

47
00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.330
There's usually some noise or
variation in our measures, so

48
00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.880
our visualizations are a bit fuzzier.

49
00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.780
As we can see in this example diagram the
strength of a correlation we see can be

50
00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.790
stronger or weaker depending on how
tightly related that values are.

51
00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.870
These examples of variations
on a linear relationship.

52
00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.690
But the same would be true around any of
the other types of patterns we'd observe.

53
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.890
There are more specific measures of
correlation that apply in statistics and

54
00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.100
mathematics.

55
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.200
The most common is the Pearson Correlation
Coefficient, which measures the degree

56
00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.370
to which there is a linear
relationship between two variables.

57
00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.610
We usually see this value
represented by the letter r.

58
00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.770
Now, our objective in this video is not
to get too deep into the math itself, so

59
00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.040
we won't be presenting the equation
that we use to calculate r.

60
00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.720
But to make a long story short, if we have
two set of measures that are perfectly

61
00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.120
positively correlated, we have r=1,
like the first diagram.

62
00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.500
Conversely if our measures
are perfectly negatively correlated,

63
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.830
we have r=-1 like the last diagram.

64
00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.440
And if there is no correlation at all
we have r=0 like the middle diagram.

65
00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.744
Of course it's generally the case that
we see something that's in between like

66
00:03:18.744 --> 00:03:19.691
the remaining cases.

67
00:03:19.691 --> 00:03:22.726
You might recall a similar measure that
shows up in the result of a linear

68
00:03:22.726 --> 00:03:23.960
regression.

69
00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.463
Usually there's something called
coefficient of determination or

70
00:03:27.463 --> 00:03:29.343
r squared which is just a square of r.

71
00:03:29.343 --> 00:03:33.123
And like r, it's a measure of the strength
of an observed relationship between two

72
00:03:33.123 --> 00:03:34.390
sets of values.

73
00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.110
We bring it up here just so you make
the connection to that type of analysis.

74
00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.912
It's not uncommon for someone to show up
with a regression analysis that has a high

75
00:03:41.912 --> 00:03:45.680
r squared value and
who wants to jump straight to causality.

76
00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.620
Since causality is what we really
wanted to get after anyway,

77
00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.510
let's shift gears a bit and
talk a little bit about that.

78
00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.210
Causation means that one event or

79
00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:56.520
state is the result of the occurrence
of another event or state.

80
00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.940
In other words there is a cause in effect
relationship between two or more ideas.

81
00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.550
When we see data that applied
a relationship a causal relationship is

82
00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:06.140
one option for what's really going on.

83
00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.000
But it's not the only one.

84
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.220
Let's assume we have two ideas A and B and
we've observe a correlation between them.

85
00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.610
How might A and B actually be related?

86
00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:18.540
Well, we might suggest that A causes B.

87
00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.650
Conversely, we could also
suggest that B causes A.

88
00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.810
However, it could also be the case
that there is a third factor,

89
00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.040
let's call it C,
that actually causes both A and

90
00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:32.510
B, such that there really is no
causal relationship between A and B.

91
00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:36.310
It's also possible that A does cause B or
vice versa but

92
00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.810
the causation actually happens
through C as an intermediate factor.

93
00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.660
Finally it can also be the case that
there's actually no relationship at all

94
00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.530
and what we are seeing in
the data is pure coincidence.

95
00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.300
This is where we sometimes
get ourselves into trouble.

96
00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:51.250
As data analyst,

97
00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.460
we're kind of hardwired to believe that
there's an answer in the data somewhere.

98
00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.050
And it makes it really hard to accept that
there might not actually be a relationship

99
00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.940
in something that might look
clearly related to our eye.

100
00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.220
But it turns out that it's not too hard
to find examples of two things that seem

101
00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.770
to correlate almost perfectly
with each other, but

102
00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:09.950
which in fact are completely unrelated.

103
00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:13.880
If you haven't already visited Tyler
Vigen's Spurious Correlations website,

104
00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.940
I suggest you pause this video and take
a few minutes to scroll through some of

105
00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.420
the more entertaining
examples of this you'll find.

106
00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:22.524
For those of you who can't get there now,
here are a few examples.

107
00:05:37.753 --> 00:05:41.336
Each one of these show a high degree
of correlation between two completely

108
00:05:41.336 --> 00:05:43.190
unrelated sets of value.

109
00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:46.678
So, the point here is we need to resist
the urge to assume relationships exist,

110
00:05:46.678 --> 00:05:48.820
when it's possible they don't.

111
00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:52.270
The other mistake we tend to make is that
we get too focused on the ideas we have in

112
00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:55.550
front of us and forget to consider
the influence of other factors.

113
00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:59.455
The specific error I see more than any
other is assuming a causal relationship

114
00:05:59.455 --> 00:06:03.182
between two characteristic or
events when there's really a third factor

115
00:06:03.182 --> 00:06:06.760
causing them both or
this relationship we saw earlier.

116
00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.830
Let's illustrate this using an example.

117
00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:10.530
Let's say that we're a wireless carrier,
and

118
00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:14.330
we're trying to assess the impact of
people accessing their account online.

119
00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.860
Among other things, we look at the simple
relationship between historical account

120
00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:19.480
access by an individual and

121
00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.570
the likelihood that the individual
will cancel their service.

122
00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:25.520
What we basically find is that people
who have accessed their account or

123
00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.210
half is likely to cancel.

124
00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:30.680
The business manager in charge of
customer attention says, this is great!

125
00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:31.500
All we need to do is,

126
00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:34.850
incent people to use the web and
we could reduce our cancel rate by half.

127
00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.180
What's wrong with this interpretation?

128
00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:41.820
Well, it depends on whether or not you
believe that the act of accessing the web

129
00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:44.430
is influencing someone's
likelihood to cancel.

130
00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:48.260
It turns out that it's far more
likely that a third factor like age,

131
00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.930
comfort with technology, or just
willingness to engage with the company,

132
00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:56.252
is driving both the likelihood to use
the web and the likelihood to cancel.

133
00:06:56.252 --> 00:06:59.380
Simply incenting people to use
the web isn't likely to change

134
00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:01.620
any of these underlying causal factors and

135
00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:04.870
therefore isn't likely to have
an impact on cancellation.

136
00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:08.350
This may seem like a really obvious
example but it actually happened.

137
00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:12.310
In fact I've seen this exact scenario and
rationale around web accessing

138
00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:15.150
cancellation come up not just once but
at least

139
00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:18.880
three times in three different places
during my time in the wireless industry.

140
00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:20.620
So it definitely happens.

141
00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:23.730
Even very smart people can
make silly mistakes sometimes.

142
00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:26.970
So how do we avoid mistaking
correlation for causation?

143
00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:30.960
Is there a way we can prove that
causation does in fact exist?

144
00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.050
More often than not, the answer is no.

145
00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:34.660
Proving causation is pretty hard.

146
00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:39.020
But what we can do is eliminate alternate
explanations either through context or

147
00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:42.300
by showing empirically that
other relationships can exist.

148
00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:45.660
In our web cancellation example, we
used reasoning based on our knowledge of

149
00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:50.150
the industry and likely customer behavior
to question the assumption of causality.

150
00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:53.935
Again, context turns out to be critical
and interpreting relationships and data.

151
00:07:53.935 --> 00:07:57.350
It should be the first line of
defense in avoiding mistakes.

152
00:07:57.350 --> 00:08:00.520
Can we think of any other plausible
explanations for what we see?

153
00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:04.260
Is there any other data that would
contradict and assume the relationship?

154
00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.320
We can also apply simple ideas
like temporal precedence.

155
00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.040
For a relationship to be causal,

156
00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:12.610
the causing factor needs to be
present before we see the effect.

157
00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:16.010
If we see something that we think is
an effect happen before its cause,

158
00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:18.360
we know that we have
the wrong relationship.

159
00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:22.240
It turns out that one of the best ways to
isolate causation is to run a controlled

160
00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:23.410
experiment.

161
00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:25.040
In a simple controlled experiment,

162
00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:28.000
I normally isolate two randomly
selected groups of subjects and

163
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.870
apply treatment to one group while not
applying that treatment to the other.

164
00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:35.150
I call this the treatment in
control groups respectively.

165
00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:37.730
I then observe differences
between the two groups.

166
00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:41.200
If I observe a difference between the
treatment and the control and I've ensured

167
00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:44.300
that the only thing that differed between
the groups is the treatment that was

168
00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:48.430
applied, then I have strong evidence that
the treatment caused the difference.

169
00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:51.750
If we have the luxury of an experiment
that's great, but if we don't,

170
00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:55.940
we fall back on our context, logic and
alternate explanation based approaches for

171
00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:57.380
assessing causality.

172
00:08:57.380 --> 00:08:59.370
So let's circle back to where we started.

173
00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:02.490
As a analyst where constantly
asking the question why and

174
00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:06.680
finding causal relationships and data
is big part of answering that question.

175
00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:09.920
But it is important to recognize
the pitfall that we can fall into and

176
00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:12.420
mistaking correlation for causation.

177
00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:15.320
In this module we'll continue
to explore ways we can fail to

178
00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:18.532
interpret data correctly, and learn
what we can do to avoid those mistakes.

179
00:09:18.532 --> 00:09:22.446
