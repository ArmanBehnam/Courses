00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.260
Suppose you an your team spent
the past month performing an in-depth

2
00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:05.760
analysis around a critical business issue.

3
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.790
You've worked your way through
all the data collection,

4
00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:09.750
preparation, and analysis.

5
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.790
You interpreted results and
developed a rock solid plan for

6
00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.410
action that aligns with
the company's strategic goals.

7
00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:17.880
All you need to do is get the sign
off from a key executive and

8
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.100
you can move forward.

9
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.190
The meeting is today and you're prepared.

10
00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:24.340
You've got a binder full of information
that shows your plan is sound, and

11
00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.890
you've brought you're laptop in
case you need anything else.

12
00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.020
Later that afternoon you find yourself
walking out of the meeting dejected.

13
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.700
The executive arrived a bit late, and
you hardly had time to start walking her

14
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.110
through the analysis design, before she
needed to run to a meeting with the CEO.

15
00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.170
You can't get on her calendar
again until next month.

16
00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:43.980
What just happened?

17
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.742
Well maybe we just got unlucky, but

18
00:00:45.742 --> 00:00:49.280
then again it makes some sense that
an executive might be short of time.

19
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.800
Is there something we could have done
better to get the sign off we needed?

20
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.350
This scenario is hardly unique,
as analysts,

21
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.900
it's our job to get
really deep in the data.

22
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.770
We get emerged in our own process and it's
very natural to focus on the analysis and

23
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.620
how we did it when we
present what we found.

24
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.120
We discovered a particular
way to look at a problem and

25
00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.280
we tend to want other people to look at
the problem in the same way that we have.

26
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.500
But that's usually not the right approach.

27
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.540
Remember that we call this part of
the process delivering the pitch

28
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.490
in our information action
value chain framework.

29
00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.432
What we're actually doing is selling our
ideas to one or more decision makers.

30
00:01:22.432 --> 00:01:23.850
And like any good sales person,

31
00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.660
the better we know our customer,
the more likely we are to make the sale.

32
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:28.380
In this video,

33
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.100
we're going to discuss the golden rule
of presentations, know thy audience.

34
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.640
Now when we say audience, we're talking
both about the people involved and

35
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.210
the environment in which
the presentation will occur.

36
00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.553
To put a little structure
around our discussion,

37
00:01:41.553 --> 00:01:44.180
we'll break this idea
down into four elements.

38
00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:49.370
The people, the period,
the place, and the process.

39
00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.920
Let's start with the most important
element of the audience, the people.

40
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.120
The more you can understand about
who exactly you're presenting to,

41
00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.710
the more you can customize your
message to appeal to that person.

42
00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.270
There are a few things we've
want to consider here.

43
00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:03.880
One is the level of the person or

44
00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.120
people involved, are they executives,
senior leaders, managers, peers?

45
00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.325
As a general rule, the more senior
the audience the more focus

46
00:02:11.325 --> 00:02:13.900
they'll be on the bigger picture and
the conclusions.

47
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:14.485
For example,

48
00:02:14.485 --> 00:02:18.660
let's say we're presenting to a group of
our peers in the analytics community.

49
00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.430
They might not be all that
interested in what we found until we

50
00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.560
showed them the process we used
to come to our conclusions.

51
00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.930
So, we generally walked them through the
analysis in a natural way from start to

52
00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.610
finish and
showed them each step along the way.

53
00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.557
However, if we presented the same
material to a senior leader or executive,

54
00:02:34.557 --> 00:02:36.149
we might do just the opposite.

55
00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:39.119
They're not all that interested in what
process we used unless we came up with

56
00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:40.720
something interesting.

57
00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.350
With this group, we generally start
with the findings then circle back to

58
00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.800
the process as needed and
probably only at a high level.

59
00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.660
Now there are exceptions to the rule.

60
00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.080
We might know that a particular
executive is very detail-oriented and

61
00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.700
prefers the walk-through approach.

62
00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.942
In that case, we customize our
presentation to meet her preferences.

63
00:02:57.942 --> 00:03:00.953
There are many other characteristics
of the people in our audience that

64
00:03:00.953 --> 00:03:03.710
might influence how we
approach a presentation.

65
00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:07.243
What is their role, are they knowledgeable
about the area we are discussing or

66
00:03:07.243 --> 00:03:09.090
will they need some context?

67
00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.597
This might influence how much lead
in material we need to include.

68
00:03:12.597 --> 00:03:15.791
What are their motivations,
are they predisposed to support or

69
00:03:15.791 --> 00:03:18.689
resist our proposal,
are the audience members aligned or

70
00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:21.249
will there be some different
function in the room?

71
00:03:21.249 --> 00:03:25.060
This could influence all sorts of
decisions we make about the presentation.

72
00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.280
Including how starkly we show issues and

73
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.880
how strong our language
should be in discussing them.

74
00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.040
What else is going on in their lives?

75
00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.310
Is there something inside or outside
the business that might distract or

76
00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:36.742
put them on edge?

77
00:03:36.742 --> 00:03:39.290
Knowing their distractions might
lead us to make our pitch more

78
00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:40.630
quickly and directly.

79
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.390
We meant also take steps
to help relieve tension or

80
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.530
focus the group on the matter at hand.

81
00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.980
Again, the more we understand the people
in our audience the more we can customize

82
00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.320
our approach to communicate
with them effectively.

83
00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.008
The second element we should consider
in making our pitch is the period.

84
00:03:55.008 --> 00:03:58.030
What we mean by period is how much
time is allotted in the meeting and

85
00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.860
when the meeting will occur.

86
00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.322
One of the most common mistakes just about
everyone makes is underestimating how long

87
00:04:04.322 --> 00:04:07.330
it will take to cover the material
they bring to a meeting.

88
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:11.220
When we try and cram too much
information into a short period of time,

89
00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.620
we either don't finish or
we end up rushing through things.

90
00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.500
And to make matters worse,
it turns out people resist

91
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.100
making decisions when they
feel their being rushed.

92
00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.270
Generally speaking, we should try to make
our pitches clear and concise as possible.

93
00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.110
But whatever we do, we need to make
sure it fits into the time we have.

94
00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.446
When we use slides in our presentation,
one rule of thumb we can use to help match

95
00:04:32.446 --> 00:04:36.022
our material to the time we have
is what we call the 5 minute rule.

96
00:04:36.022 --> 00:04:39.931
The 5 minute rule suggests that each
slide in a presentation will occupy

97
00:04:39.931 --> 00:04:42.120
about 5 minutes of time.

98
00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.040
So, for a 30 minute meeting,
we can plan to cover 6 slides.

99
00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:50.110
For a 60 minute meeting,
we could plan to cover around 12 slides.

100
00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.000
You'll find that many people think
they can cover more than this and

101
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.480
they tend to be mistaken.

102
00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:58.610
They don't account for how long it takes
the audience to absorb the information or

103
00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.860
don't anticipate time needed for
questions or discussion.

104
00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.950
Often the time we have for a meeting is
closely related to who we're meeting with.

105
00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:09.176
We may have 90 minutes with a manager and
his team but

106
00:05:09.176 --> 00:05:11.693
we may only get 15 minutes with the CFO.

107
00:05:11.693 --> 00:05:15.183
The quantity and composition of our
content needs to adjust to fit both

108
00:05:15.183 --> 00:05:17.310
the time and the people involved.

109
00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.160
We also need to consider when
a meeting is taking place.

110
00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.120
Is it first thing Monday morning,
if so we might expect a slow start.

111
00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.960
People might be a bit late or take
longer to re-engage after the weekend.

112
00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.270
Is it late Friday afternoon,
we might need to fight fatigue or

113
00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.560
distraction as people look to get home.

114
00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.110
Is there some other event, like a board
meeting before or after our meeting?

115
00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.870
Is the organization in
the middle of budget planning?

116
00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:41.280
Is it right before or after lunch?

117
00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.460
You get the idea.

118
00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.020
All these things might influence
how we present to our audience.

119
00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.260
Let's move on to a third element
we should consider, place.

120
00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.930
There are few aspects of place
that could be important.

121
00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:53.670
One is the size of the room.

122
00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:57.010
Usually it's not too much of an issue
if a room is a bit too large, but

123
00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:00.320
a room that's too small tends to
make things a little uncomfortable.

124
00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.150
If we can't change it, we can at
least recognize the environment and

125
00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:05.580
adapt our content or style to compensate.

126
00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:08.340
The orientation of the room
can also play a role.

127
00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:09.660
How is seating arranged?

128
00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:12.880
Is it set up in a way where it's
natural for everyone to be seated, or

129
00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.900
is it designed for
a formal standing presentation?

130
00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.250
How are people likely
to arrange themselves?

131
00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:19.790
If we have control over the room,

132
00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:22.850
we can often be strategic
about how we set things up.

133
00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:25.930
If we want a formal presentation,
we can set up the room one way.

134
00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:29.090
If we want a less formal discussion,
we can set it up another way.

135
00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:31.890
One technique that's handy for
stimulating conversation and

136
00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:36.190
avoiding an us versus them set up is
to have your team show up early and

137
00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:39.010
distribute themselves
evenly around the room.

138
00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:40.080
This makes it harder for

139
00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:43.690
subgroups to gather together,
say on one side of the table.

140
00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:46.990
We also need to understand what
technology's available in the room and

141
00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:48.398
we need to be able to make it work.

142
00:06:48.398 --> 00:06:51.044
Struggling with a projector or
speakerphone for

143
00:06:51.044 --> 00:06:55.058
the first 10 minutes of a 30 minute
meeting is an easy path to failure.

144
00:06:55.058 --> 00:06:57.238
So is showing up to a meeting
with only a laptop,

145
00:06:57.238 --> 00:07:00.789
and finding out there's no monitor or
projector, or that's it's broken.

146
00:07:00.789 --> 00:07:01.441
Or even worse,

147
00:07:01.441 --> 00:07:05.190
planing to use the conference bridge
when there's no phone in the room.

148
00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:08.475
Speaking of conference bridges, it's
also becoming an increasing common for

149
00:07:08.475 --> 00:07:12.480
meetings to include participants via phone
conferences and web conferences, with or

150
00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:13.880
with out video.

151
00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:15.630
Whether people are in the room or not,

152
00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:18.600
can drastically change how
we execute a presentation.

153
00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:22.900
We generally need to work a bit harder to
actively engage remote participants, and

154
00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.180
it's obviously more difficult
to read body language and

155
00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:26.850
other queues from the audience.

156
00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:29.900
We may also need to leave a bit more
time to repeat certain things and

157
00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:32.870
give space to those not present
to provide their input.

158
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:34.810
We can also be strategic here,

159
00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:37.430
is it important that certain
people be physically in the room?

160
00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:38.870
Can we go to them?

161
00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:42.330
Should we have separate face-to-face
meetings versus one conference call?

162
00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:46.380
The better we know the audience, the
better decisions we can make about place.

163
00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:49.300
The last element we'll discuss is process.

164
00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:53.330
What we're trying to capture with process
are the expectations our audience

165
00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:56.310
has on how we got to the presentation or
how we execute it.

166
00:07:56.310 --> 00:08:00.308
This element is strongly dependent on the
norms and culture of the organization and

167
00:08:00.308 --> 00:08:03.180
the personal expectations
of leaders involved.

168
00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:06.961
For example, an executive might expect
that we've already walked the key direct

169
00:08:06.961 --> 00:08:09.604
report through our proposal
before we present it to her.

170
00:08:09.604 --> 00:08:13.230
And she might expect that person to
be there during the presentation.

171
00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:15.050
If we haven't followed this process,

172
00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:18.210
we're not likely to get the support
we need from the executive.

173
00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:21.280
An organization might also have
a formal process or forum for

174
00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:23.880
raising certain types of issues or
proposals.

175
00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:25.880
This might be a program
management process,

176
00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:30.330
a standing monthly review meeting, or even
a staff meeting of a leader or executive.

177
00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:34.160
In these instances, we need to be aware of
the rules governing those processes, and

178
00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:35.770
make sure we're following them.

179
00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:38.730
This might impact the time we have and
the structure of our content,

180
00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:39.800
among other things.

181
00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:43.400
Those are a few common process
considerations, but there are others.

182
00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:46.190
Is every meeting expected
to have a formal agenda?

183
00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:48.660
If the meeting is over
lunch is food expected?

184
00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:51.970
Is it customary to extend optional
invitations to adjacent leaders or

185
00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:53.980
others involved in the process?

186
00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:56.480
So what is it look like when
we put all of it together?

187
00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:59.536
Let's say we've been working on
an analysis that shows an opportunity for

188
00:08:59.536 --> 00:09:01.570
a targeted upsell campaign.

189
00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:04.690
We've worked with marketing on
a plan to execute the campaign but

190
00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:08.570
we need buy-in from both the sales and
customer management executives.

191
00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:11.330
We know that both leaders expect
their teams to be engaged.

192
00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:15.530
So we've had pre-meetings with each group
and invited the key folks to our meeting.

193
00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:18.587
We've made sure that both leaders are
available to be in the room although we

194
00:09:18.587 --> 00:09:22.280
had to drive over to the headquarters
building to ensure face-to-face meeting.

195
00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:24.030
Because not everyone can make the trip,

196
00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:26.310
we've set up a web meeting
with a conference bridge.

197
00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:29.980
The good news is that we were able
to get a full hour on the calendars.

198
00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:32.052
We really want to facilitate a discussion,
so

199
00:09:32.052 --> 00:09:35.131
we've secured a room where everyone
can sit down, see each other and

200
00:09:35.131 --> 00:09:38.910
see a large wall monitor where we
plan to show the presentation.

201
00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:41.775
The slides themselves will be
viewable in the web conference for

202
00:09:41.775 --> 00:09:45.192
remote participants but just in case
we send out the deck in advance and

203
00:09:45.192 --> 00:09:48.820
we printed a few paper copies just in
case we have a technology problem.

204
00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:50.997
On the day of the presentation
we leave a bit early and

205
00:09:50.997 --> 00:09:53.286
set ourselves up in the room
prior to the meeting time.

206
00:09:53.286 --> 00:09:56.922
We have a minor issue getting the monitor
to work but we resolved in plenty of time

207
00:09:56.922 --> 00:10:00.017
to spread ourselves out in the room,
start the web conference, and

208
00:10:00.017 --> 00:10:02.890
open up the conference bridge
before everyone else arrives.

209
00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:03.730
We have an hour, but

210
00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:06.660
we also know that executives can
get pulled away at any time.

211
00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:07.970
So, we've planned our discussion so

212
00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:11.010
that we can get the basics
covered in 30 minutes or so.

213
00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:14.520
We have a core six page deck we want
to walk through, but we have additional

214
00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:19.260
material and an appendix in case we have
questions or time for further discussion.

215
00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.970
We also know that one of
the executives has just gotten

216
00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:23.870
back from a week long conference and

217
00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:27.635
the other has a major meeting with his
regional sales leaders the next day.

218
00:10:27.635 --> 00:10:32.040
Our plan is to acknowledge both,
state our desire to be mindful of time and

219
00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:34.960
present a proposal in a way
that leads with a punchline

220
00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:37.760
then provides only the key
supporting evidence.

221
00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:41.736
Experience with these leaders suggest they
prefer to cover information in that way.

222
00:10:41.736 --> 00:10:43.445
If they have more detailed questions,

223
00:10:43.445 --> 00:10:46.470
we're prepared with more
material in our appendix.

224
00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:48.430
As you can see,
just about everything we've done,

225
00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:50.370
we've done with our audience in mind.

226
00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:52.672
Now anything can happen once
the meeting starts, but

227
00:10:52.672 --> 00:10:54.821
if we've done a good job
of knowing our audience,

228
00:10:54.821 --> 00:10:57.758
we'll maximize the likelihood that
our pitch will be successful.
