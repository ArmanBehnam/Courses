00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.840
The output of your analysis and

2
00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:08.300
the analytic models that you have
created has an important story to tell.

3
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.990
And you are the only one
that can give it a voice.

4
00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.940
However, before you can present results,
you need to understand

5
00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.200
what you have discovered and
make sense of what you have.

6
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.130
Your own examination of results
precedes the presentation to others.

7
00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:26.050
In other words,

8
00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:31.550
you must figure out what is the story
that you want to tell and to whom.

9
00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.460
The nature of the story and

10
00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.270
the audience will determine how
you are going to present it.

11
00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:43.020
Telling a story about data analytic
results requires some basic skills.

12
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.620
In this video,
we will review some best practices

13
00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.450
that will help you create effective
stories of analytic results.

14
00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:56.300
The following principles come from
the excellent book by Stephen Few

15
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.300
titled Show Me the Numbers.

16
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.632
The story must be simple,
this sounds reasonable but

17
00:01:01.632 --> 00:01:04.490
it's often difficult to achieve.

18
00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:09.080
You first must get to the essence of
what you want to communicate, and

19
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.000
then find the best possible
way to present it.

20
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.710
Simplicity means getting rid
of what is not essential.

21
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.070
For example,
suppose that I want to show results of our

22
00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.270
efforts to increase the graduation
rate at the lead school.

23
00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.430
So I could use this graph
that shows the change

24
00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.790
in the Leeds' graduation rate compared
to the Arts and Sciences department and

25
00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.610
also compared to the CU border campus.

26
00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.880
But is this really what
I want to communicate?

27
00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.350
Suppose that I'm presenting this
to the Leeds school board members.

28
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.390
They probably just care about how
much progress we have made from

29
00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.810
where we were five years ago.

30
00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.390
If that's true,
then I can simplify things tremendously.

31
00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.630
I can use a visual like this,

32
00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.590
which emphasizes where we are now
compared to five years ago.

33
00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.930
Your story must seamlessly
integrate words and pictures.

34
00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.020
Images and words are processed
by different parts of the brain.

35
00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.580
So visual and verbal communication
can be presented in parallel and

36
00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.680
this results in richer understanding.

37
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.170
Stories should be informative.

38
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.951
This means that the results that you
are presenting should be something new for

39
00:02:20.951 --> 00:02:22.220
the audience.

40
00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.740
There is also need to be shocking or
surprising but

41
00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:31.420
they don't need to reveal something
that the audience doesn't already know.

42
00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.190
Of course if you have something
surprising to reveal,

43
00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.530
then your message will stick even more.

44
00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.555
You should tell true stories.

45
00:02:38.555 --> 00:02:43.960
The story should not only be true, but
the audience should perceive it as true.

46
00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:48.310
The story should not only be
validated with relevant evidence, but

47
00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.220
it should also be supported
by citing relevant sourcing.

48
00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.380
Projecting conviction and
transparency will strengthen your message.

49
00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:03.430
Numerical patterns and trends are best
understood when presented in some context.

50
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.930
Relevant comparisons
give meaning to numbers.

51
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.770
And enable judgment decision making and
action.

52
00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.500
Contextual data may include targets,

53
00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:21.186
forecast, historical values or
benchmarks, such as industry standards.

54
00:03:21.186 --> 00:03:24.180
Suppose that you're
presenting sales revenue, for

55
00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:30.210
this year in a line chart like this,
has this been a good year so far?

56
00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:33.510
Well, we can't tell, we need context.

57
00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.940
So we can add sales revenue from last
year to create the following chart.

58
00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:44.070
Now, we can tell that this year's sales
volume is higher than last year's.

59
00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:49.450
Also we shouldn't worry about sales
leveling off from June to July,

60
00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.870
because that's better that what
happened last year when sales revenues

61
00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.330
decrease from June to July.

62
00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.040
We could even add more context,
for example,

63
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.260
we could add these years target
revenues and create a chart like this.

64
00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.834
This chart really tells a story,
the story is so far,

65
00:04:08.834 --> 00:04:11.302
we're doing better than last year.

66
00:04:11.302 --> 00:04:16.260
And not only that, we're exceeding
the targets that we set for this year.

67
00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.130
In the last video,
they talked about knowing your audience.

68
00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.760
The main idea about knowing your
audience is to present results in terms

69
00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.030
that are familiar to them.

70
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:32.052
If you can present your findings in simple
language that is familiar to everyone,

71
00:04:32.052 --> 00:04:36.790
there is no reason to use technical or
cryptic terms.

72
00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.640
You won't get any style points for that.

73
00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:44.300
Experts have no problem
understanding abstract concepts.

74
00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:49.380
But unless everyone in your audience is
an expert you should provide concrete

75
00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:54.050
examples to help people
make sense of abstractions.

76
00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:59.880
For instance, very large or very small
numbers are difficult to understand.

77
00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.250
Take production scheduling,
in this area we know that examining

78
00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:09.230
all possible job sequences,
to select the best, is not practical.

79
00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:15.620
If you have 20 jobs then there
are 2.1 quintillion sequences.

80
00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:20.560
Now this sounds like a large number,
but how large is it?

81
00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:26.000
Instead of quoting the number we can
say that a modern computer with a fast

82
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.440
processor will require almost four months
to examine all the sequences of 20 jobs.

83
00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:37.429
And what's more shocking is that
the time explodes to almost seven years

84
00:05:37.429 --> 00:05:39.414
by just adding one more job.

85
00:05:39.414 --> 00:05:39.990
You see,

86
00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:46.210
we had translated a very large number into
a value that has more practical meaning.

87
00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:50.220
In this case, what's meaningful
is the time that it would take

88
00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:55.240
to find an optimal sequence by
examining all possible sequences.

89
00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.900
So remember,
you want a story that is simple.

90
00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:03.670
That is seamless in the integration
of words and visuals,

91
00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:10.278
that is informative, that is true,
that is framed in the right context.

92
00:06:10.278 --> 00:06:15.640
That is told in terms that are familiar to
the audience, and that it uses concrete

93
00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:21.330
examples to help audiences
understand abstract concepts.

94
00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:24.310
Are you ready to create these
type of stories with numbers?

95
00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:25.009
I hope so.
