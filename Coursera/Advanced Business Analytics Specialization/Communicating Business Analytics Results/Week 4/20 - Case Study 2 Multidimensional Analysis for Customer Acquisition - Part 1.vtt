00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.190
In the next few videos,
we'll walk through a comprehensive example

2
00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:06.660
of how data analytics is applied in
concert with more qualitative and

3
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.300
business analysis to help guide
a major strategic decision.

4
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.070
This case study illustrates
a number of things.

5
00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.820
First, it shows how we apply
the idea of thinking backwards.

6
00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.130
By way of review,
this means the following.

7
00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.480
We start with the decision
we want to make.

8
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.360
We then determine what analysis
outputs would help make that decision.

9
00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.270
We design the analysis that
creates those outputs.

10
00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.670
We determine what data is needed for
analysis and how to get it.

11
00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:33.980
And finally, we execute the analysis.

12
00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.520
The example also illustrates how different
types of analytics can be used in

13
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.800
one larger effort, and
how quantitative and

14
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.500
qualitative considerations contribute
to business decision making.

15
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.090
Finally, it illustrates a couple of
ways in which data can be displayed and

16
00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.420
presentation materials created.

17
00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.370
In this video we'll tee
up the situation and

18
00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.400
walk through the thought process
leading up to the analysis.

19
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.190
In the next video we'll walk
through the analysis itself.

20
00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.030
And in a third video we'll see how the
results were constructed and presented.

21
00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.070
Let's start by setting the context.

22
00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.650
A technology company in a highly
competitive industry was at

23
00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.680
a key strategic juncture.

24
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.610
They needed to grow their customer base,
but they felt that the existing

25
00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.370
approach to customer acquisition
was too broad and unfocused.

26
00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.500
There were a number of internal opinions
on how a new strategy should be focused.

27
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.490
Some felt the company should focus
more on younger customers and

28
00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.250
set the stage for the future.

29
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.800
Others wanted to concentrate
on growing minority and

30
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.740
ethnic segments that reflected
increasing diversity in the market.

31
00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.070
Still more proposed a strategy targeting
families that cut across age, race, and

32
00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.150
ethnicity.

33
00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.860
At the same time,
the company had to consider the impact of

34
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.470
any strategy on a set of key
metrics important to shareholders.

35
00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.460
These included new customers added and
customers lost,

36
00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.940
overall revenue, revenue per customer and
overall customer profitability.

37
00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.977
The strategy needed to achieve
growth in the customer base but

38
00:01:53.977 --> 00:01:57.970
couldn't sacrifice revenue or
customer profitability in the process.

39
00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.740
Finally, the strategy
needed to be actionable.

40
00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.610
There had to be a way to appropriately
target new customers using a combination

41
00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.330
of mass media like television and radio as
well as direct marketing like email, mail,

42
00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.820
or outbound calling.

43
00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.830
The company was committed to a data driven
approach and wanted a comprehensive

44
00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.000
analysis that could identify and
quantify a number of options for action.

45
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.380
They had a clear idea of
the decisions they wanted to make.

46
00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.790
With this objective in mind, the nature
of the analysis outputs was considered.

47
00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.710
Ultimately the analysis would drive
toward the creation of option summaries.

48
00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:33.238
Perhaps one or
two slides that described each option and

49
00:02:33.238 --> 00:02:36.848
a summary that compared those
options on key dimensions.

50
00:02:36.848 --> 00:02:39.690
Each summary would need to show
how the option was constructed and

51
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.430
provide key metrics and other
information important to stakeholders.

52
00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.945
A comprehensive analytic approach was
designed to produce the information

53
00:02:46.945 --> 00:02:49.730
required for options summaries and
comparisons.

54
00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.320
At the high level
the approach look like this,

55
00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.490
first a way to segment
customers would be determined.

56
00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.380
We'll get into more detail in a bit, but

57
00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.680
this would involve the assessment of a
number of third party segmentation schemas

58
00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.270
that would allow the company to link
internal data to external market data.

59
00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.570
Secondly, the right geographic
segmentation method would be determined.

60
00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.250
The company operated nationally
across many types of markets, but

61
00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.540
some consolidation of markets would
be necessary to execute the strategy.

62
00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.500
Furthermore, the team thought
that the customer segments could

63
00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.790
be used to help inform the geographic
segmentation decision.

64
00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.520
So the customer segments
would be used as inputs

65
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.010
to the geographic segmentation effort.

66
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.380
A combined segmentation approach
using customer characteristics and

67
00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.210
geography would then be driven
into two parallel efforts.

68
00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:40.930
The first would use internal data to
describe the current customer base and

69
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.300
to establish the historical performance
of customer segments in terms of

70
00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:45.990
lifetime value.

71
00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:48.580
The second would use external market data

72
00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.740
to determine what the acquisition
opportunity was for each segment.

73
00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.290
The internal and external analysis
streams would then converge

74
00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.560
to construct complete
characterization of each option.

75
00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.590
After consultation with key leaders,

76
00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.770
it was determined that the following seven
potential strategies should be assessed.

77
00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:10.350
The first four driven solely by metrics,
the other three driven by demographics.

78
00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.650
The first strategy would seek to maximize
the total size of the customer base.

79
00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.050
A second strategy would try and
maximize total revenue.

80
00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:21.550
A third would attempt to
maximize revenue per customer.

81
00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:25.080
A fourth strategy would maximize
customer profitability.

82
00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.050
The fifth would focus on teens,
tweens, and young adults.

83
00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.150
The sixth would focus on minority groups
like African-American, Hispanic, and

84
00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.704
Asian communities.

85
00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.560
And finally, the seventh
strategy would focus on families.

86
00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.730
Before the team started to
execute on the analytic plan, and

87
00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:44.940
inventory of potential data
sources was constructed.

88
00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.710
Most of the external data required for

89
00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.460
the analysis was expected to be
available via third-party sources.

90
00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.080
Specifically by using tools related
to the segmentation schemas

91
00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.440
that would be evaluated in step one.

92
00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.570
Sources were identified for key pieces
of internal data as well, including

93
00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:05.450
revenue information, cost drivers related
to products activity and contacts, and

94
00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:09.360
other customer characteristics like
credit risk, tenure and status.

95
00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.400
Additionally, there were various internal
documents and results of earlier analysis

96
00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.400
that were assembled and reviewed to help
build context around the current state and

97
00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.110
how certain future strategies
might be implemented.

98
00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.730
At this point the team was confident that
it can accomplish a high quality analysis

99
00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:27.180
that would be used to inform a business
decision around the acquisition strategy.

100
00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.990
In our next video we'll
dig a little deeper and

101
00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.170
see how the analysis was actually done.

102
00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:32.705
See you then.
