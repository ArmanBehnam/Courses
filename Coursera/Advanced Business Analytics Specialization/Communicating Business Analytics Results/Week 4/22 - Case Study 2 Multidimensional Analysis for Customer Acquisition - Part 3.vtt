00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.540
Welcome to our third and
final video outlining a case setting on

2
00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.760
how one company applied
a multi-dimensional analytic approach

3
00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.990
to decide on a strategy for
acquiring new customers.

4
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.940
In our last video, we walked through most
of the steps in the analysis itself.

5
00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.240
Again, here's the high level process
the team used to execute the analysis.

6
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.200
By way of a quick review, a customer
segmentation effort fed into a geographic

7
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.970
segmentation effort, which jointly guided
internal and external analysis streams.

8
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.810
The internal stream provided
the information about the current customer

9
00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.530
base and
the relative value of different segments.

10
00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:35.800
The external analysis provided
information about the market size,

11
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.750
market penetration and overall opportunity
for acquiring customers no segments.

12
00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.000
In this video, we're going to pick up
where we left off and see how the internal

13
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.880
and external analysis were brought
together, summarized and presented.

14
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.560
The first step in bringing the analysis
together was to calculate forward looking

15
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.650
metrics for each of the seven potential
strategies the team was asked to examine.

16
00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:56.700
As a reminder,

17
00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.780
these strategies were, maximize
the total size of the customer base.

18
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.550
Maximize total revenue.

19
00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.650
Maximize revenue per customer.

20
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.930
Maximize customer profitability.

21
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.500
Focus on teens, tweens and young adults.

22
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.000
Focus on minority groups.

23
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.820
And focus on families.

24
00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.440
A financial model was built
in Excel to calculate

25
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.660
the annualized acquisition volume and
revenue opportunity

26
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.180
on each option based on the values
obtained from the internal analysis and

27
00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.060
the opportunities obtained
from the external analysis.

28
00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.490
Specifically, projections were
provided for each strategy and

29
00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.510
acquisition volume, total revenue,
revenue per customer and

30
00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:37.680
relative desirability which if you recall
was was mobilized customer value measure.

31
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.330
At this point the analysis hit a snag.

32
00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.410
When the team looked at the matrix for the
last three groups base strategy it become

33
00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.120
immediately obvious that the volume in
total revenue opportunities for any of

34
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:53.200
these strategies alone would be far to low
to be practical options for the company.

35
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.390
Rather than just blindly
adhere to the plan and

36
00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.585
complete the assessment as directed,
the team paused and

37
00:01:58.585 --> 00:02:03.050
re-engaged leadership to outline the
initial findings and get further guidance.

38
00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.360
A short focus deck was prepared
to discuss the issue and

39
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.280
the working materials
the team had developed so

40
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.940
far were available in appendix in case
there are any more detailed questions.

41
00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.700
The outcome of the meeting was some
consolidation on the last three

42
00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:16.870
strategies.

43
00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.280
The youth and minority strategies would be
combined into one growth segment strategy.

44
00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.950
And families would be included in a new
strategy that focused on segments with

45
00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.010
high switcher and intender opportunities
as informed by the external analysis.

46
00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.760
With this new direction the team refined
some of the opportunity values and

47
00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.740
modified the financial model to provide
key metrics for these new strategies.

48
00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.480
At this point the team had all the hard
quantitative information it needed to

49
00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.600
characterize each key strategy.

50
00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.650
In many analytical projects,
this might be the point which results or

51
00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.210
summarize the presented.

52
00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.860
However, given the strategic
nature of this project,

53
00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.840
it was important to supplement
the quantitative outputs with more

54
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.230
qualitative information around the
implications of selecting each strategy.

55
00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.750
The team consulted with the number of
subject matter experts in the company to

56
00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.940
assess the impact of each strategy
on a variety there is including.

57
00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:12.000
Products and services, equipment,
offering and pricing, advertising,

58
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.840
distribution, technical infrastructure and
customer services.

59
00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.630
Unique issues were captured as well and
each strategy was placed in context

60
00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.210
by identifying competitors that
might have similar strategy.

61
00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:28.400
We walk into a lot of detail
around how this is done but

62
00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.500
it is important to recognize that most
data analytics projects are really part of

63
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.300
some larger decision analysis process.

64
00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:40.040
As a data analyst, you may not have a
direct hand in other parts of that process

65
00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.430
but it is important to understand how
your piece fits into a larger content.

66
00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.130
With both quantitative and quality of
aspects of the assessment in hand,

67
00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.390
the team is ready to summarize
the results of the analysis.

68
00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.670
The team elected to use a summary and
visualization technique

69
00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.150
commonly referred to as the Baseball Card
Approach to show the different strategies

70
00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.880
in a way they could easily be compared to
each other across a variety of dimension.

71
00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.790
For those not familiar with baseball
cards, they're small, wallet-size,

72
00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.110
cardboard summaries of baseball players.

73
00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.430
They usually have a picture of the player,
the team they play for,

74
00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.790
key characteristics of the player,
and performance statistics.

75
00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.750
They follow a standard format, and
the nice thing about the cards is

76
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.040
they can be arranged next to
each other and easily compared.

77
00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.050
Here's one example of
an actual Baseball Card.

78
00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.560
The Baseball Card approach involves
developing the standard slide format that

79
00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.660
shows key characteristics and measures
around each option, usually in one or

80
00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.190
two slides at the most.

81
00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:38.300
These slides can easily be arranged
next to each other on a table or

82
00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.800
large display so that options can be
compared with same level of detail.

83
00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.310
The baseball card slides themselves
are usually supplemented with the summary

84
00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.540
slide or two, which compares options at
a high level, as well as an executive

85
00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.320
summary slide, which provides
the punchline or recommendation.

86
00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:57.440
Earlier in the course, we talked about
there being an art to putting enough

87
00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.310
detail on slides to allow them
to stand on their own, but

88
00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.190
not overloading slides
with too much information.

89
00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:06.740
The baseball card approach really
pushes the limit of this idea.

90
00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.430
We need to have a lot of
information on each slide but

91
00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.850
we need people to understand it easily.

92
00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.680
To get around this problem,
the team actually incorporated some

93
00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.150
instructions in their deck for
how to read each set of cards.

94
00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:19.390
Here's how they did it.

95
00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:22.990
This will also give you a sense for what
the actual baseball cards look like for

96
00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:24.012
each strategic option.

97
00:05:24.012 --> 00:05:28.780
[BLANK AUDIO] Let's look at

98
00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.950
the structure of the cards at a high
level, starting with the first card,

99
00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:34.809
which shows most of the factors from
the core quantitative analysis.

100
00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:39.460
The upper left area uses a graphical
map to show which age groups and

101
00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.310
minorities and
non minority groups are covered.

102
00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:44.200
It also provides key summary matrix.

103
00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:47.770
The lower left are shows
a breakdown of the top

104
00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:51.170
customers segment that will
be targeted by that strategy.

105
00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:54.780
Note the use of numeric textual and
graphical information

106
00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:58.359
all in the same table to officially
communicate a lot of information.

107
00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:03.670
The upper-right area gives a sense of
concentration by showing which segment

108
00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:07.770
groups are targeted as we move
more deeply into a population.

109
00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:12.040
The fewer and taller the bars,
the more focused the strategy.

110
00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:16.310
The lower right area shows how those same
segment groups are targeted geographically

111
00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:17.700
with a similar interpretation.

112
00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:22.260
The second card focuses more
on the qualitative factors.

113
00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.830
The upper left provides
a textual summary of the option.

114
00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:29.030
The lower left shows the key
competitors that were likely to target

115
00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:29.878
the same customers.

116
00:06:29.878 --> 00:06:34.390
And the right-hand side provides
an assessment of how well the strategy

117
00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:38.550
aligns with a variety of internal
capabilities and other factors.

118
00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:41.300
Round ideograms called Harvey balls

119
00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.570
are used to indicate the degree
of alignment in each area.

120
00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:49.220
This is a great example of adding a degree
of quantification to qualitative data

121
00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:53.200
to help the audience quickly
identify the most important factors.

122
00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:57.410
Together each pair of slides provided
a fairly detailed look in to how each

123
00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:59.180
strategy would be structured, and

124
00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:03.280
because they all follow the same format,
they were pretty easy to compare.

125
00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:07.030
However, the team new they needed to
provide higher level summary as well.

126
00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:10.090
So, they constructed two slides
that showed all options on a few

127
00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:11.380
key dimensions.

128
00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:13.180
Here is the first slide.

129
00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:16.840
The left side illustrates the size of
the opportunity in terms of customers and

130
00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:18.840
total revenue for each strategy.

131
00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:20.620
Which tend to move together.

132
00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:23.630
The right side shows a tradeoff
between profitability and

133
00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:26.140
revenue per customer across strategies.

134
00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:29.753
A few bullet points are provided on each
slide to convey the most critical points.

135
00:07:34.069 --> 00:07:37.808
Here is the second slide,
this slide uses Harvey Balls to summarize

136
00:07:37.808 --> 00:07:43.210
the quantitative and qualitative factors
in a similar way across all strategies.

137
00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:45.460
A few things to take note of here.

138
00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:48.160
See how the color shading is
used to group the factors and

139
00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.590
map them to the focus of each strategy?

140
00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:55.150
Also, putting the balanced strategy at
the far right was a strategic choice.

141
00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:58.760
The team was advocating for
the strategies of the prefered option,

142
00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:02.080
putting it at the end, allowed
the audience to see the shortcomings in

143
00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:06.100
the other strategies first, as they
naturally moved from left to right.

144
00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:08.870
A small visual clue in
the form of a plus sign

145
00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:12.290
was a subtle nod to the balance
strategy as the favorite.

146
00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:16.213
In fact, the selection of the term
balanced itself to describe the strategy

147
00:08:16.213 --> 00:08:19.954
was meant to appeal to the conservative
nature of the leadership team and

148
00:08:19.954 --> 00:08:24.084
was another subtle clue to team used to
draw attention to the preferred option.

149
00:08:26.018 --> 00:08:29.782
Okay, before we wrap up let's take just
a moment and talk about the overall

150
00:08:29.782 --> 00:08:34.560
communication process and the material the
team developed to support that process.

151
00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:38.060
Through the course of the project the team
developed a variety of summary materials

152
00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:42.240
that described the analytic process and
the detailed findings of the analysis.

153
00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:46.370
These were assembled into one large
deck with about a 100 slides.

154
00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:50.310
A summary deck of about 20 slides
which included the base ball cards was

155
00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:51.980
also constructed.

156
00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:56.680
Finally, a short six slides executive
summary was added to facilitate high level

157
00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:57.800
briefings.

158
00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:01.280
If you remember the pyramid principle
we discussed earlier in the course,

159
00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:03.820
that's basically what was
applied in this case.

160
00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:07.450
The series of meanings that follow
the analysis all use some combinations of

161
00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:11.010
these materials, depending on
the audience and the time available.

162
00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:13.900
In all cases the full side of
the materials was available incase

163
00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:15.310
they are any detailed questions.

164
00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:18.190
So that's it, hope you enjoyed the case.

165
00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:23.950
Wait, you actually want to know
what happened, fair enough.

166
00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:25.960
Thanks to the backwards thinking process.

167
00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:29.960
The clear but flexible analysis plan and
the purpose for visualization and

168
00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:33.220
communication of the findings
the leadership team did feel comfortable

169
00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:36.560
in moving forward the balanced option
that was proposed by the team.

170
00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:40.520
The resulting actions and outcomes were
widely considered to be a success.

171
00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:42.850
Now we've reached the end
of our case study.

172
00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:46.380
Hopefully we've delivered on the objective
that we said out in the first video.

173
00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:50.210
Namely showing you how we apply
the idea of thinking backwards.

174
00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:53.540
Providing an example of how different
types of analytics can be used in

175
00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:54.780
one larger effort.

176
00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:55.870
And how quantitative and

177
00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:59.750
qualitative considerations contribute
to business decision making.

178
00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:03.540
And finally, illustrating a couple of
way in which we can display data and

179
00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:05.510
create presentation material.

180
00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:08.640
I sincerely hope you enjoyed this
case study and this course, and for

181
00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:12.480
those of you taking multiple course,
the specializations as a whole.

182
00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:15.320
If we've been successful we've
helped you lay a foundation for

183
00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:18.880
understanding how data analytics
are actually done in the real word.

184
00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:22.250
Now it's up to you to continue to
build your knowledge, and experience.

185
00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:24.482
Best of luck as you start
your own analytic journey.
