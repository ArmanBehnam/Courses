00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:02.510
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:03.630
In our first three modules,

3
00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:07.230
we spent a lot of time talking about
how analytics are accomplished.

4
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.350
We outline the overall process for
how data is generated, captured,

5
00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:16.410
stored, extracted, analyzed, and
driven towards a business action.

6
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.270
However, we haven't spent a lot of time
talking about who actually performs these

7
00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.040
operations.

8
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.880
Now hopefully you as a data analyst,
will be doing many of these things.

9
00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.380
But there are a lot of other
people involved in creating and

10
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.160
maintaining the data environment
that you rely on to be successful.

11
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.320
In this video we'll outline some of
the most common roles in data and

12
00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.200
analytics organization.

13
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.710
Understanding who this people are and
what they do in your organization

14
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.370
will help you both understand
the environment better and

15
00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.880
help you to identify the relationships
you'll need to build to be most effective.

16
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.250
Our value chain discussion in
module one assumed that somewhat

17
00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.040
linear pathway between
events in the real world and

18
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.370
action in the market place
that's fueled by information.

19
00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.890
However, real organizations aren't
constructed around information alone.

20
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.290
It's more likely that your organization
would be organized around functional

21
00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.010
groups like marketing or finance,
customer groups like enterprises or

22
00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:14.350
small businesses, or line of business like
a software group versus a hardware group.

23
00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.280
Furthermore, there's often some sort of
separation between organizations that

24
00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.700
focus on information technology, IT and

25
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.870
organizations that focused on
the customer facing side of the business.

26
00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:27.440
With these different structures and

27
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.440
divisions come people with specialized
skills or knowledge in each group.

28
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.210
This presents a bit of a trade of between
technical skills and contextual acumen.

29
00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.970
It's often the case that resources with
more technical skills tend to do the heavy

30
00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:41.670
lifting in the data environment.

31
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.880
While those with more context to do
interpret data and make decisions.

32
00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.070
When we think about data and

33
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.490
analytics we find ourselves at
the intersection of these worlds.

34
00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.580
We're one part IT, one part business and
we're one part technical and

35
00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.110
one part contextual.

36
00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.390
However, we can still think about
division of responsibilities

37
00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.049
in terms of the outputs that are produced.

38
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.970
Let's outline the major functional
activities that take place in a real data

39
00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:06.910
environment.

40
00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:11.135
Specifically data architecture,
data management, reporting,

41
00:02:11.135 --> 00:02:13.870
Ad-Hoc analysis and modelling.

42
00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.466
You'll notice that this
functions are similar but

43
00:02:16.466 --> 00:02:20.521
not exactly the same as the classes of
analytic tools we outlined in module two.

44
00:02:20.521 --> 00:02:24.755
The reason is that here we're focusing
on who does the work not how the work

45
00:02:24.755 --> 00:02:26.210
gets done.

46
00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.720
Each of this functions may use multiple
classes of tools to get the job done.

47
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.520
Let's defined each of this functions.

48
00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.320
Data architecture refers to the design in
the data environment to meet the need of

49
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.820
the enterprise.

50
00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.570
Data management involves
the actual building and

51
00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.000
maintenance of the data environment.

52
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.710
Reporting, as we discussed in module two

53
00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:51.000
enables standard periodic renderings of
specific metrics or data relationships.

54
00:02:52.475 --> 00:02:56.750
Ad-hoc analytics broadly refers to
the directed analysis that seek to answer

55
00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.770
a specific question, particularly
one that is new or infrequent.

56
00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:05.270
If we find ourselves doing the same thing
repeatedly, we're really doing reporting.

57
00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.740
However, there's a natural linkage
between ad-hoc analytics and reporting.

58
00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.940
For example, I may seek to answer
a question that's never been asked before.

59
00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.960
I'd execute an ad-hoc analysis to do that.

60
00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.040
If the analysis reveals
something interesting and

61
00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.480
I determine I'd like to see
the result each week or

62
00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.279
each month, I'd streamline and automate
the results into a standard report.

63
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.480
Finally, modeling refers to advance
analysis or application of data using

64
00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.420
higher order techniques,
including statistical procedures.

65
00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:40.155
Broadly, the three more analytic
functions in this list namely reporting,

66
00:03:40.155 --> 00:03:44.810
ad-hoc analysis and
modeling may be described as data mining.

67
00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.230
A term that refers to the process of
extracting useful information from data or

68
00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.510
mining insights.

69
00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.760
Let's add one more subjective
distinction to this list or

70
00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.750
there are always exceptions to the rule.

71
00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.010
It turns out that the functions at
the ends of the spectrum tend to rely

72
00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.040
a little more on creativity and
design, thinking and problem solving.

73
00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.580
Well, those toward the center tend to rely
more on operational and management skills.

74
00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.220
Think about of building a house,
the same type of idea applies.

75
00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.130
The architecture designs the house and
the interior decorator who finishes it

76
00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.511
tend of somewhat more
creative personalities.

77
00:04:18.511 --> 00:04:22.340
The master plumbers,electricians and
carpenters who actually build out

78
00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.510
structures and systems in
the house are equally skilled but

79
00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.129
more focused on structural repeatability
and robustness of function.

80
00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:32.145
The same things are true
in our data environment.

81
00:04:32.145 --> 00:04:35.140
Now that we've the sense of
the broad functions performed in

82
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:36.079
the data environment,

83
00:04:36.079 --> 00:04:40.180
let's talk about the specific teams or
roles that support all those function.

84
00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.130
We'll start with the more
technical IT centric roles and

85
00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:45.750
move towards more analytical and
business related roles.

86
00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.990
Let's start with a couple of
highly technical IT support areas,

87
00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:52.810
one is infrastructure.

88
00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.580
Infrastructure teams manage the physical
hardware and connections that exist both

89
00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.990
inside the company and
which link to the outside world.

90
00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:04.080
Most of this activity will likely be
transparent to users of the data but

91
00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.280
it's critical to the operation
of the data environment.

92
00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:11.860
Another area is system and
application development in administration.

93
00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.330
These teams build and maintain systems
that capture information for the business.

94
00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:20.000
They may also provide ancillary
functions like corporate IT

95
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.260
that help to administer software and
other tools.

96
00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:27.870
Both of these types of teams are almost
always located in an IT organization or

97
00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.070
an organization devoted
to software development.

98
00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.700
There are another set of technical roles
that are more directly associated with

99
00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:36.170
the data environment.

100
00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:40.990
We'll call these technical data management
and business intelligence delivery roles.

101
00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.210
The first of these is the data architect.

102
00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:47.100
The data architect is responsible for the
actual design of the data environment and

103
00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.530
is usually the person responsible for
structuring the data models

104
00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:53.139
used in enterprise databases for
the data storage and access.

105
00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.430
This role is normally found
in an IT organization

106
00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:00.880
either in a data warehousing team or
larger enterprise architecture team.

107
00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:07.470
A second role is that of
the database administrator or DBA.

108
00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:10.880
The DBA is broadly responsible for
the database itself.

109
00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.810
Including creation of the database and
maintenance of the database to

110
00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:17.480
ensure stability, accessibility and
efficient performance.

111
00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.600
One important role, the DBA can
also play is helping analyst or

112
00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.820
other database users to tune
their queries to run efficiently.

113
00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:27.660
This can be really helpful if you
find you're queries are failing or

114
00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:28.769
taking a long time to run.

115
00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:34.280
A third role in this area is that of
the ETL developer, or more generally,

116
00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.320
a data integration developer.

117
00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:41.700
As a reminder, ETL stands for extract,
transform and load, or the process of

118
00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:46.310
taking data from one place, manipulating
it and placing it somewhere else.

119
00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:49.800
These developers are largely responsible
for populating a database and

120
00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:53.600
making sure the data is loaded correctly
into the various database structures.

121
00:06:54.820 --> 00:07:00.000
Both DBA's and ETL developers are also
usually located in an IT organization

122
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.560
often within a data warehousing team.

123
00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:06.160
The last role we'll discuss in this
area is the business intelligence or

124
00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.710
BI development.

125
00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:11.180
The BI developer sits right on
the boundary of what most organizations

126
00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:13.060
consider an IT function.

127
00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:15.260
This role can take a few
different forms but

128
00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:19.020
generally the BI Developer manages
some of the more technical aspects of

129
00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:22.220
a business intelligence tool
set including maintenance.

130
00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:25.030
And is often responsible for
the technical implementation and

131
00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:26.429
distribution of standard reports.

132
00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:30.820
Let's move onto some rolls more closely
aligned with data manipulation and

133
00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:32.080
analysis.

134
00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:35.980
The first is the database analyst, who
is someone who has the skills to access

135
00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:39.580
the database directly usually
by writing SQL queries, and

136
00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:42.690
who may have the ability to do at
least some analysis on the data.

137
00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:47.300
Some organizations establish a layer
of database analyst between the data

138
00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:50.640
environment and the more contextual
analysts in the business.

139
00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:55.410
Consequently, these roles sometimes
actually exist within an IT organization.

140
00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:59.220
Although best practices increasingly
to locate them with business functions.

141
00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:03.980
A data analyst may or
may not access the database directly, but

142
00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:06.710
usually has enough additional
context about the business to

143
00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:10.830
execute a wide range of analysis
on the data and draw a conclusion.

144
00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:14.450
This is the central role around which
most data analytics functions revolve

145
00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:15.630
in many organizations.

146
00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:20.580
The modeler is a more skilled
extension of the data analyst.

147
00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:24.230
The modeler usually spends most of his or
her time perform predictive and

148
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:27.820
prescriptive analytics on data
using sophisticated techniques

149
00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:30.670
which is somewhat more advanced
than a basic data analyst role.

150
00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:33.330
Both the data analyst and

151
00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:36.450
the modeler are normally part
of a business side organization,

152
00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:40.220
either a functional team or a cross
functional team dedicated to analytics.

153
00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:43.790
The last role in this area
is a bit different and

154
00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:46.120
is a role that is often misunderstood.

155
00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.940
This is the role of the business analyst.

156
00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:52.440
Business analysis is not really
a data analytics function.

157
00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:55.520
It's the process of analyzing
how a business works.

158
00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:58.450
Normally with the goal of identifying
ways in which a process or

159
00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:00.740
business system can be improved.

160
00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:03.710
Sometimes business analysis
incorporates data, but

161
00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:07.350
unlike data analytics it's not
really the core objective.

162
00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:08.830
With these roles in particular,

163
00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:11.470
you might be thinking that
the distinctions are pretty fine,

164
00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:15.270
and that we seem to have spoken to all
these ideas already in the course.

165
00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:17.130
You're exactly right.

166
00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:19.730
Even though this roles have
been separated in the past,

167
00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:22.330
what we're finding is the best
analytic to perform by

168
00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:25.920
individuals who can move
seamlessly across all of them.

169
00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:29.620
They have the technical ability to pull
data like the data base analyst but

170
00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:31.510
they also have the strong context that and

171
00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:33.880
business understanding
of the business analyst.

172
00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:38.380
Not to mention the analytical chops to
accomplish data analytics in modeling.

173
00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:42.700
This idea is actually a pretty nice segue
to the last role we'll discussing this

174
00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:44.820
video, the data scientist.

175
00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:48.540
It turns out, the data scientist is used
to describe a lot of different roles

176
00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:50.420
depending on the organization.

177
00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:54.600
Sometimes it is used as a alternative to
the modeler role we discussed earlier,

178
00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:57.630
especially when the organization
is seeking someone with very deep

179
00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:00.959
knowledge of statistical procedures
like a PhD in statistic.

180
00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:06.080
Increasingly however organizations
are using the term of data scientist to

181
00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:10.105
describe exactly the type of blended role
that blurs the lines between traditional

182
00:10:10.105 --> 00:10:10.930
roles.

183
00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:13.690
This person has a broad
analytical skill set, but

184
00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:16.140
also has a high degree of context.

185
00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:20.150
They also apply scientific approach but
our master communicator's who can

186
00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:23.209
explain how analytical findings
translate to business action.

187
00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:28.540
A consultant and blogger, Brendan Tierney,
has actually put together a nice visual,

188
00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:30.840
describing what the data
scientist is expected to do.

189
00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:32.420
It looks like this.

190
00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:36.630
What you see here is that data
science sits in the middle of

191
00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:40.680
all sorts of different data manipulation
and analysis activities and operates

192
00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:44.730
within a process of driving analytics
understanding to problem solving.

193
00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:48.150
It's actually nice summary of a lot of
the ideas we presented in this course.

194
00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:52.190
Okay, let's quickly recap
what we've covered.

195
00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:56.250
First, we noted that real organizations
are usually organized around functions,

196
00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:58.690
customer groups, or lines of business.

197
00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:01.270
Next, we defined some
broad classes of data

198
00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:04.180
analytics activities
performed in an organization.

199
00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:08.325
Specifically data architecture,
data management, reporting,

200
00:11:08.325 --> 00:11:11.490
ad-hoc analysis and modeling.

201
00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:14.200
We then covered the number of
specific roles that perform one or

202
00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:15.680
more of these functions.

203
00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:17.540
Namely, highly technical IT and

204
00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:20.375
support roles like infrastructure and
application development.

205
00:11:20.375 --> 00:11:24.612
Technical data management and
BI roles including the data architect,

206
00:11:24.612 --> 00:11:28.220
data base administrator,
ETL developer and BI developer.

207
00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:34.080
Data manipulation and analysis roles like
the data base analyst, the data analyst,

208
00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:36.820
the modeler and the business analyst.

209
00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:37.420
And finally,

210
00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:40.140
we discuss the multi-dimensional
role of the data scientist.

211
00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:45.253
Knowing who the players are in your
organization will allow you to better

212
00:11:45.253 --> 00:11:48.878
understand how the analytical
process works, where you are and

213
00:11:48.878 --> 00:11:52.251
who you can go to for information,
advice and assistance.
