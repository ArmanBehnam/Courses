00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:03.940
Imagine you're trying to organize
a game of football in an international

2
00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:05.130
summer camp.

3
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.090
You've gathered some interested people,
you've placed them at different positions

4
00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.430
on the field, and you've introduced
equipment to use during the game.

5
00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:14.290
You blow the whistle to start,
and all of a sudden,

6
00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.060
you realized the game isn't working
quite as well as you planned.

7
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.090
First of all, some folks think
you're playing American football.

8
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.960
Others are thinking soccer and
a few came ready for rugby.

9
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.395
Also, it turns out that some of your
players have never actually played

10
00:00:28.395 --> 00:00:31.039
the game before, or
have only practiced on their own and

11
00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:32.632
don't know how to play as a team.

12
00:00:32.632 --> 00:00:34.955
There's general confusion as
to what the rules are and

13
00:00:34.955 --> 00:00:37.210
what the overall game plan should be.

14
00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.309
Without some guidance, our game has
quickly deteriorated into chaos.

15
00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.595
Managing how data is used across
an organization can be a lot like this.

16
00:00:45.595 --> 00:00:48.920
There are typically many people involved,
and those people have different points of

17
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.850
view and
expectations on how things should work.

18
00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.680
The idea of data governance is
intended to put some structure

19
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.860
around how data is managed and
used in an organization.

20
00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.533
By establishing rules and processes around
a variety of data related operations and

21
00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:03.270
decisions.

22
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.473
In this video, we'll cover some of
the most common areas addressed by

23
00:01:06.473 --> 00:01:10.070
data governance, and how data governance
might be set up in an organization.

24
00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.646
Let's start by discussing four
major functions of data governance.

25
00:01:14.646 --> 00:01:17.650
Establishing & Maintaining Standards.

26
00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.739
Establishing Accountability for Data.

27
00:01:19.739 --> 00:01:22.600
Managing & Communicating Data Development.

28
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.710
And Providing Information
about the Data Environment.

29
00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.790
A primary role of data
governance is to establish and

30
00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.840
maintain standards around data.

31
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.200
This can take a few different forms.

32
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.780
The first, is identifying what sources
are preferred for each type of data or

33
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.170
metric used in an organization.

34
00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.590
There's an idea called Master Data
Management, or MDM, which identifies

35
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.310
the most critical data within an
organization and ensures there is a clear

36
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.510
understanding of where that data should
come from and where it should be stored.

37
00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.550
A related idea is that of
common reference data.

38
00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.200
Generally speaking, reference data
provides sets of allowable values for

39
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.150
certain data attributes, or
provides additional descriptive

40
00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.450
information about key ideas in
the company's data environment.

41
00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.590
Sometimes this data is loosely referred
to as look up data, or dimensional data.

42
00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.040
Data governance helps to ensure that
reference data is complete and accurate.

43
00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.670
Data governance also helps to establish
common definitions and calculations.

44
00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.000
The same term might have different
meanings across the organization.

45
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.060
And different teams might use slightly
different calculations to arrive at

46
00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.579
the same metric.

47
00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.300
Governance helps to ensure that
everyone is on the same page and

48
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.480
does things the same way.

49
00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.480
The last set of controls are around
data access and compliance.

50
00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.030
A governance process can help to find who
should have access to data under what

51
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.740
circumstances, and is often applied in
support of more general sarbanes oxilly,

52
00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.340
or sox controls and data privacy concerns.

53
00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.530
We'll talk about data privacy
more in a separate video.

54
00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.220
The second major role of data
governance is to establish and

55
00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:55.982
maintain accountability for data.

56
00:02:55.982 --> 00:02:59.265
We'll talk a bit more about how data
governance programs are structured in

57
00:02:59.265 --> 00:03:00.400
a few minutes.

58
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.220
But usually organizations
assign responsibility for

59
00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.590
specific data domains to
individuals called data stewards.

60
00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.740
Data stewards are generally
accountable for

61
00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.670
ensuring that their area has the correct
definitions and are responsible for

62
00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.240
the overall state of their data domain.

63
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.070
Governance can also help
identify who is responsible for

64
00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.300
addressing various types
of data quality issues.

65
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.300
Like data privacy,

66
00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.989
we'll cover data quality in more
detail in a separate video.

67
00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.685
The third role of data governance, is to
help manage the overall process of data

68
00:03:31.685 --> 00:03:35.260
development and to communicate
changes to the data environment.

69
00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.623
Lots of teams use data and everyone of
them probably has a laundry list of

70
00:03:38.623 --> 00:03:42.272
additions or modifications
they'd like to see implemented.

71
00:03:42.272 --> 00:03:46.060
However, there's usually not enough
capacity to accomplish them all and

72
00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.810
there needs to be some way of prioritizing
the work that needs to get done.

73
00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.640
Governance can help by providing
a process for vetting, assessing, and

74
00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.050
prioritizing which data projects
are undertaken, usually by rationalizing

75
00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.400
those projects against the overall
business priorities of the enterprise.

76
00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:07.238
Because data environments are constantly
evolving, there also needs to be some

77
00:04:07.238 --> 00:04:10.690
mechanism for letting the users of
the data know when new data is added.

78
00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.080
Or some change or improvement is made.

79
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.720
Having a well structured data governance
approach can facilitate communication

80
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.000
about data and make sure everyone is
informed and aware of the changes.

81
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.530
The last role that data governance plays,

82
00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.840
is in providing information about
the data environment itself.

83
00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.273
There's a broad class of activities
called metadata management,

84
00:04:30.273 --> 00:04:34.170
which helps to keep track of metadata,
or data about data.

85
00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.350
Given that we've gone through all the
trouble of creating standard definitions

86
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:41.080
and calculations, it's generally
useful to formally document them and

87
00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.770
provide that documentation
to the enterprise.

88
00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.910
We also might want to provide information
about the lineage of data and

89
00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.520
metrics, which traces where
data elements come from.

90
00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.060
Or keep a history of changes that
have been made to a data environment.

91
00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.980
All of these would fall
under metadata management.

92
00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:00.460
We also might want to provide information
about the quality of certain data domains

93
00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:01.670
or metrics.

94
00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:04.609
Governance mechanisms can help
serve as a clearing house for

95
00:05:04.609 --> 00:05:05.941
this type of information.

96
00:05:05.941 --> 00:05:09.729
Metadata can speak to the what and
where of the data environment, but

97
00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:12.485
it can also indicate how
good the information is.

98
00:05:12.485 --> 00:05:16.666
Likewise, governance can help keep track
of the who, including tracking who data

99
00:05:16.666 --> 00:05:21.040
stewards are and who may be involved
in other data governance functions.

100
00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.220
Users can consult this information to
determine who to contact with questions or

101
00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:26.230
concerns about the data.

102
00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:31.433
So that's what data governance does,
let's switch gears a bit and

103
00:05:31.433 --> 00:05:32.726
talk about how it works.

104
00:05:32.726 --> 00:05:35.933
There can be a lot of variance in how
data governance is implemented within

105
00:05:35.933 --> 00:05:37.240
an organization.

106
00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.780
However, there are a few
characteristics that are almost

107
00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.670
always present in a successful program.

108
00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.536
The first is cross-functional
representation.

109
00:05:45.536 --> 00:05:48.853
The whole point of data governance
is to get everyone on the same page.

110
00:05:48.853 --> 00:05:51.840
To do that, everyone needs to be involved.

111
00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.625
The best governance structures have
broad participation across technical and

112
00:05:55.625 --> 00:05:59.870
nontechnical teams, usually via
something like a data governance council

113
00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.600
that brings those groups together and
addresses governance issues.

114
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.720
The second,
is an ongoing process and schedule.

115
00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.940
A data governance council doesn't
do much good if it never convenes,

116
00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:11.740
or doesn't convene often enough.

117
00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:13.720
Or if it doesn't make any decisions, or

118
00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.400
if it has no mechanism
to execute on decisions.

119
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.900
A sound data governance program
provides the structure.

120
00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:23.100
The third common element,
is a set of defined roles.

121
00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:26.180
Someone needs to act as
the defacto leader of the program.

122
00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.980
This may be a Chair of
the Governance Council or other leader.

123
00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:32.500
Earlier, we discussed to
role of data stewards.

124
00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.070
Some form of data stewardship or

125
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:36.635
ownership is critical to
a successful governance program.

126
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.340
Beyond these ideas, data governance
structures can take many forms and

127
00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:44.310
you may see some functions
implemented in different ways.

128
00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:46.950
For example,
sometimes an organization will

129
00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:49.520
formally staff a data governance
to team that develops and

130
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:53.980
coordinates processes and handles things
like meta data management or data quality.

131
00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:58.070
However, more often than not,
data governance is executed virtually,

132
00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:01.630
with responsibilities rolled into the
normal job functions on those on the cross

133
00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:02.220
functional team.

134
00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:04.401
Likewise, the drive for

135
00:07:04.401 --> 00:07:07.362
data governance can come from
different parts of the organization.

136
00:07:07.362 --> 00:07:10.540
In some cases,
the function is executed out of IT.

137
00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:12.850
Other times is driven
by an analytics team.

138
00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:16.604
It's also quite common to see data
governance driven by a functional group,

139
00:07:16.604 --> 00:07:18.057
like finance or operations.

140
00:07:18.057 --> 00:07:21.226
This doesn't change the cross
functional nature the activity, but

141
00:07:21.226 --> 00:07:24.790
who takes the lead can say a lot about
how the organization thinks about data.

142
00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:29.890
Finally, some organizations may adopt
more formal tools to assist in their data

143
00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:31.100
governance efforts.

144
00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:34.160
While others take a less formal or
manual approach.

145
00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:37.591
There are robust software tools that
can help with master data management,

146
00:07:37.591 --> 00:07:39.480
metadata management, or data quality.

147
00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:42.400
But not all organizations
find them necessary.

148
00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:45.180
It's not uncommon to see organizations
build their own tools or

149
00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:47.810
use informal documentation methods,
like Wikis or

150
00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:50.549
even standalone documents,
to manage data governance activities.

151
00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:52.770
At this point,

152
00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:56.560
we've covered the major roles the data
governance programs play in organizations.

153
00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:58.230
As well as how those
functions are executed.

154
00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:01.270
With some detail around what
good programs have in common and

155
00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:02.150
how they tend to differ.

156
00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:06.130
Why is this important to
you as the data analyst?

157
00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:09.220
It's really all about knowledge,
context, and the ability for

158
00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:11.749
you to have confidence in the data
you're using for analysis.

159
00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:15.515
Being tied into your company's
data governance program,

160
00:08:15.515 --> 00:08:18.849
or helping to create one if it doesn't
exist, can help you rapidly learn

161
00:08:18.849 --> 00:08:22.093
about what's available,
understand what's good and what's not.

162
00:08:22.093 --> 00:08:25.752
And keep abreast of new additions or
changes to the data environment.

163
00:08:25.752 --> 00:08:29.070
This in turn will assure that you're
always using the best data available

164
00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:30.150
for the job.

165
00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:32.267
And will help you produce
the best insights you can and

166
00:08:32.267 --> 00:08:33.643
have confidence in your results.
