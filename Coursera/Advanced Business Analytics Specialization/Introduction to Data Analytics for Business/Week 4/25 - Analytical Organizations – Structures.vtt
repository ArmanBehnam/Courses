00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:04.330
In some of our other videos in this
course, we discuss the types of analytical

2
00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:06.820
functions that are performed
within the organization.

3
00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:09.500
And the various roles that
accomplish those functions.

4
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.199
In this video, we're going to talk
about how analytics teams in general

5
00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:15.638
are situated within
the larger organization.

6
00:00:15.638 --> 00:00:19.816
It turns out that how your organization
thinks about analytics can have a big

7
00:00:19.816 --> 00:00:22.765
impact on not only the types
of analysis you perform.

8
00:00:22.765 --> 00:00:24.723
But on the efficiencies
of those analytics,

9
00:00:24.723 --> 00:00:27.620
as well as the speed at which your
skills and knowledge can evolve.

10
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.440
The material in this video is derived both
from our experience in advising companies

11
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.840
on how to develop high performing
analytical capabilities.

12
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.340
As well as building and
leading analytic teams of our own.

13
00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.130
For the purposes of this discussion
we're really talking about some

14
00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.230
combination of reporting,
ad hoc analytics and modeling functions.

15
00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.230
And roles like database analysts,
data analysts, modelers and

16
00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.360
data scientists, although other
roles could be included as well.

17
00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.870
How analytic teams are structured within
an organization tends to hinge upon one

18
00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.180
basic question.

19
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.050
How centralized or decentralized
should these organizations be?

20
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.950
Should analytics activities
be gathered under one team or

21
00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.830
should they be embedded within many teams?

22
00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.610
As you might imagine, the answer depends
on a number of different factors.

23
00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.220
What we'll do here is present
four different models for

24
00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.250
analytical organizations that speak to
different degrees of centralization.

25
00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.650
We'll describe each model and
outline some of it's major pros and cons.

26
00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.230
To illustrate, we'll use a visual
representation like this.

27
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.500
What we have here is one circle in
the center that represents functions that

28
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.710
are centralized.

29
00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.739
With a ring a ring of satellites circles
that represents non-centralized teams

30
00:01:36.739 --> 00:01:40.005
based on the overall organizational
structure of the business.

31
00:01:40.005 --> 00:01:42.060
These might be areas like marketing or
finance,

32
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.720
in a functionally organized company.

33
00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.627
Where teams align to customer groups or

34
00:01:45.627 --> 00:01:49.140
lines of business if the company
is organized that way.

35
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.870
We use dark shading to illustrate
where analytics functions take place.

36
00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.190
And we'll show collaboration between
the peripheral teams in the center using

37
00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:57.970
dotted lines.

38
00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:59.460
So, let's get started.

39
00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.230
We'll begin with a fully centralized
model, where some set of analytical

40
00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.830
activities are accomplished
using one centralized team.

41
00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.420
For example, an enterprising analytics
team might serve the needs of marketing,

42
00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.630
finance, operations, customer care, etc.

43
00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.419
With respect to reporting,
ad hoc analysis and statistical modeling.

44
00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.570
A centralized model has
a few key advantages.

45
00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.820
First, we can usually achieve
a higher level of consistency when

46
00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.450
analysis is done by a single team,
since it's

47
00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.070
easier to ensure that common methods
are used from one analysis to the next.

48
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.300
It's also easier to ensure that
the priorities of the team,

49
00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.290
including what analyses are done and
when, are aligned with the overall

50
00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.910
needs of the enterprise versus
the needs of only one group.

51
00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.210
Finally, analysis tens to become very
efficient in the centralized team it gets

52
00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:48.602
a lot of practise.

53
00:02:48.602 --> 00:02:52.470
Especially when analytics or
less contextual an more procedural.

54
00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.380
This usually means, I get more analytical
output out of fewer resources.

55
00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.320
However, these advantages come at a cost.

56
00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.650
In a centralized model,
the team that executes the analysis

57
00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.020
is usually not the same the team
that asked for the analysis.

58
00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.730
Collaboration is required and

59
00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.030
the requesting organization may
not get priority of other needs.

60
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.368
In this case, the centralized team is less
responsive to peripheral organizations and

61
00:03:17.368 --> 00:03:20.720
it's harder for those organizations
to control their destinies.

62
00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.579
A second disadvantage is around contexts,
someone who sits in marketing and who does

63
00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:30.046
marketing all the time is going to have
a higher degree of marketing contexts.

64
00:03:30.046 --> 00:03:32.489
Than an analyst in
the centralized organization,

65
00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:35.400
who may work on a lot of different things.

66
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.930
Finally, while the centralized
model requires fewer people,

67
00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.950
it does rely on some
consistency on work load.

68
00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.230
It's harder to fill the plate
of a centralized analytical team

69
00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.080
with non-centralized, non analytical
activities when the workload is light.

70
00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:53.130
The second model called
the allocated model

71
00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.480
seeks to improve on the responsiveness
of the analytical organization while

72
00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.770
retaining most of the benefits
of a centralized approach.

73
00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:00.720
In this model,

74
00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.750
a sentimental analytical activity is still
accomplished using a centralized team.

75
00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.690
But within that team specific
capacity is reserved for one or

76
00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.850
more of the peripheral functions.

77
00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:12.730
Usually, this means that the peripheral
organization gets to make

78
00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.150
prioritization decisions
around what work is done and

79
00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.760
when up to the limits of
their allocating capacity.

80
00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.640
Some additional capacity is reserved in
a centralized team to handle ebbs and

81
00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.460
flows in peripheral demand, or

82
00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.360
to direct additional effort towards
overall enterprise priorities.

83
00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.000
Again, the main benefit of
this approach is improved

84
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.300
responsiveness to the organization
requesting analysis.

85
00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.170
It can also have the benefit of improving
the context of the analyst group,

86
00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:41.290
especially when individuals
are allocated to a single function for

87
00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.250
an extended period of time.

88
00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:44.440
At the same time,

89
00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.470
it's still possible to maintain a good
level of consistency and methods.

90
00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.470
And the team still has some
discretion to balance efforts and

91
00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.080
support on broader priorities.

92
00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:58.260
The challenge with the allocated approach
is that it can be hard to match the level

93
00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.850
of allocation desired with
the overall needs of the enterprise.

94
00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:04.930
Inevitably, some organizations
will end up too much or

95
00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.980
too little capacity,
where the reload perceived.

96
00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:11.670
This approach also tends to require
slightly larger resource for.

97
00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:15.589
Since we will move some of the flexibility
and how those resources can be deployed.

98
00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:19.670
Let's say we take this
one step further and

99
00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:24.170
actually distribute our analytical
resources across functional teams.

100
00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:27.450
But we put structures of
processes in place to allow some

101
00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:30.310
degree of coordination across those teams.

102
00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:33.360
What we have in this case is
called the coordinated model.

103
00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:34.970
In this model, the staffing and

104
00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:39.420
priorities of the analytical resources are
completely controlled by functional teams.

105
00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:43.864
However, these teams are tied together
by some set of government structures,

106
00:05:43.864 --> 00:05:48.661
standard methodologies or communities like
users groups or centers of excellence.

107
00:05:48.661 --> 00:05:52.344
For example, let's say we add separate
analytics teams within marketing,

108
00:05:52.344 --> 00:05:53.600
finance and operations.

109
00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.468
But those teams regularly
convened in a users group and

110
00:05:56.468 --> 00:06:00.520
participated in an enterprise
level data governance program.

111
00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.040
This would be a coordinated model.

112
00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:06.724
The benefits of this approach build
on those of the allocated model.

113
00:06:06.724 --> 00:06:08.929
With full control of resource priority,

114
00:06:08.929 --> 00:06:11.900
functional analytics teams
can be highly responsive.

115
00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.454
And since they are integrated
into specific functions,

116
00:06:14.454 --> 00:06:17.337
a high level of context within
those functions can be achieved.

117
00:06:17.337 --> 00:06:22.278
At the same time, coordination of across
teams helps to ensure that there is some

118
00:06:22.278 --> 00:06:25.270
degrees of consistency in method and
approach.

119
00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:31.930
However, coordination’s across teams
is notorious with difficult to achieve

120
00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:36.170
it's also much more likely the work will
be duplicated across organizations or

121
00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:39.580
the different group will come up
different answers to the same question.

122
00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:43.220
You'll hear this described as
multiple versions of the truth,

123
00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:46.870
which can be a big drain on
an organization's effectiveness.

124
00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:50.930
Finally, the coordinated approach tends
to require more resources than more

125
00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:52.180
centralized structures,

126
00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:55.610
sends each organization's staffs to
handle its own peaks and workload.

127
00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:59.974
The last organizational model we'll
discuss is the distributed model,

128
00:06:59.974 --> 00:07:03.440
were analytic activities are wholly
accomplished within peripheral

129
00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:06.500
organizations with little or
no coordination.

130
00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:10.090
For example, the business and
consumer division of a large bank

131
00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:13.640
might have completely separate analytics
teams that work in different locations and

132
00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.460
on different problems.

133
00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:18.735
The advantages of this model
are similar to the coordinated model.

134
00:07:18.735 --> 00:07:20.960
Namely, a very high degree
of responsiveness and

135
00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:22.820
context could be achieved.

136
00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:26.310
The team also has complete flexibility
in how they accomplish analytics

137
00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:30.290
since they don't necessarily need
to adhere to centralized standards.

138
00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:34.017
On the downside, there's little
guarantee of consistency in methods or

139
00:07:34.017 --> 00:07:35.047
even data sources.

140
00:07:35.047 --> 00:07:37.486
It's much more likely the efforts
may be duplicated, and

141
00:07:37.486 --> 00:07:40.395
this approach generally requires
the largest number of resources.

142
00:07:40.395 --> 00:07:44.740
Since they're few mechanism to identify
overlap and streamline activities.

143
00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:48.480
So which of these models is preferred?

144
00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:49.950
Well, that really depends.

145
00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:53.420
There are organizations that have found
success using each of these models, and

146
00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:55.600
even combinations of these models.

147
00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.830
Rather than ranking the models,
why don't we look for

148
00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:01.590
some factors that tend to make each model
more or less viable in an organization?

149
00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:06.000
The most significant factor that
influences our organizational model

150
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.840
is the size of the company.

151
00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:10.580
It turns out that analytical
organizations really start

152
00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:14.040
performing well when they reach
a critical mass of resources.

153
00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:18.030
The specific number varies but
at least a few analysts.

154
00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:21.610
Having multiple perspectives on the team
generally encourages knowledge sharing,

155
00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:24.760
learning and
development of skills across team members.

156
00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:28.950
More senior members can help teach more
junior members and newer members may have

157
00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:32.660
new perspective that complement
a knowledge based of more tenured members.

158
00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:34.180
The larger an organization is,

159
00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:37.560
the easier it is to create
multiple teams with critical mass,

160
00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:40.690
hence a higher likelihood that less
centralized models will work well.

161
00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:45.840
It's entirely possible that you'll find
yourself as the only analyst on the team.

162
00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:48.020
Does this mean you're set up for failure?

163
00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:51.860
Not necessarily, it just means that you'll
need to work harder to find other people

164
00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:54.690
to learn from, or you might need to
get really good at self teaching.

165
00:08:56.450 --> 00:08:59.260
The second factor influencing
organizational design

166
00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.995
is how different the analytical
methods are across the organization.

167
00:09:02.995 --> 00:09:06.775
The more similar the methods, the more
to be gain from centralized model where

168
00:09:06.775 --> 00:09:10.855
many different resources could be brought
together to execute the analysis.

169
00:09:10.855 --> 00:09:14.705
If the methods are completely different or
require highly specialized knowledge,

170
00:09:14.705 --> 00:09:16.765
something more decentralized
may work just fine.

171
00:09:17.885 --> 00:09:21.435
Depending on the nature of the work,
the physical location of an organizations

172
00:09:21.435 --> 00:09:25.610
functions can also have a meaningful
impact on the viability of the model.

173
00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:29.480
When an organization and it's functions
are centrally located, it's much easier to

174
00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:33.750
manage things like responsiveness and
collaboration with a centralized team.

175
00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:36.510
When organizational groups
are geographically distributed,

176
00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:40.540
especially at a global scale,
it can make more sense to embed some or

177
00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:43.999
all analytical functions in those
groups via a decentralized design.

178
00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:48.820
Even though telepresence technologies
make remote collaboration much easier,

179
00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:51.640
differences in time zones
alone are often enough to push

180
00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:53.020
organizations in this direction.

181
00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:58.560
The last factor we'll discuss
is our old friend, context.

182
00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:02.180
As we noted earlier, more decentralized
models tend to place analysts

183
00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:04.240
closer to the business
functions they serve.

184
00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:07.390
It can build a higher degree
of context in that area.

185
00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:10.570
Depending on how much context and
specialization is needed,

186
00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:14.060
a decentralized model might be
more effective in certain cases.

187
00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:16.650
More often than not,
when companies grapple with how to setup

188
00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:21.430
analytics organizations, it's usually
a battle between responsiveness and scale.

189
00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:25.000
Most organizations want the efficiency
that some degree of centralization

190
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.710
provides, but want to retain the context
to control of more decentralized modules.

191
00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:33.300
For that reason, many companies
end up in either the allocated or

192
00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:34.520
coordinated structures.

193
00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:38.540
Of course, this assumes the company has
actually thought through how to best

194
00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:40.300
organize for analytics.

195
00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:42.100
This may or may not be the case.

196
00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:46.100
It's entirely possible and even probable
that an organization is failing to reach

197
00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:49.200
its potential because of
an ineffective structure.

198
00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:52.700
This is where you have the opportunity
to leverage what we've learned here.

199
00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:56.260
As you explore your organization and
get familiar with where and how analytics

200
00:10:56.260 --> 00:11:00.620
are done, you can assess what's working
well and where there might be opportunity.

201
00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:03.829
And over time, you can help to influence
the way your organization evolve.

202
00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:07.510
You probably won't be able
to do this on day one, but

203
00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:11.770
there are some things you can do that are
consistent with the ideas we've covered.

204
00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:15.460
Let's say you do find yourself as
the loan analyst in a functional team.

205
00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:18.670
There's no reason why couldn't seek out
other analysts and other functions and

206
00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:21.470
put together an informal
knowledge sharing group.

207
00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:24.010
The point here is that you
can use the creativity and

208
00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:27.160
inquisitive nature that drew you
to analytics in the first place

209
00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:30.490
to help make your analytics
organization the best it can be.

210
00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:33.349
Now that you understand the common
ways analytics are structured in

211
00:11:33.349 --> 00:11:35.858
an organization and
what factors drive those structures,

212
00:11:35.858 --> 00:11:39.185
you're well prepared to help lead your
organization in the right direction.
