00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:02.910
Welcome to module four.

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:06.510
So far in this course we've really been
focused on you as the data analyst and

3
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:07.950
the tools of the trade.

4
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.920
We've learned how to think through
analytical problems and outlined a value

5
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.630
chain of events that describe how
the analytic process is executed.

6
00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:18.500
We've examined the wide variety of tools
available in the data environment and

7
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.070
how those environments are built.

8
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.580
We've even spent a fair amount of time
learning some technical SQL skills

9
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.610
that help us directly
access the data we need.

10
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.030
Now it's time to turn our attention
outwards and look at what else is around.

11
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.630
If you watched the introduction
to the course,

12
00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.830
you might recall that we used a surfing
analogy to describe our approach to

13
00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:36.470
data analytics.

14
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.470
Even the best surfers in the world don't
just show up on an unfamiliar beach and

15
00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.260
start paddling into the surf.

16
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.770
They take the time to
understand the environment,

17
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.060
they take the time to understand what's
out there and how the break works.

18
00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.660
They learn what's below the surface,
they observe for

19
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.210
a while to see where to paddle out and
where to catch the wave.

20
00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:56.993
They also understand
who else is out there.

21
00:00:56.993 --> 00:01:00.168
They recognize there are locals who know
the environment better than they do.

22
00:01:00.168 --> 00:01:03.710
They understand the customs and the do's
and don'ts of that particular location.

23
00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:05.750
Just like the surfer,

24
00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.400
you'll need to understand your environment
if you want to perform at your best.

25
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.535
In this module we'll focus on
real analytical organizations and

26
00:01:12.535 --> 00:01:15.504
on the people, structures and
practices that support them.

27
00:01:15.504 --> 00:01:19.600
We'll start by examining various roles
that exists in your organization.

28
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.969
As a data analyst, yours is one.

29
00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:25.374
But there are many other people whose jobs
are critical to enabling your success.

30
00:01:25.374 --> 00:01:29.722
We'll then take a look at how analytic
organizations are structured.

31
00:01:29.722 --> 00:01:32.210
We'll review the pros and
cons of different approaches and

32
00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.259
understand what factors drive companies
to organize in different ways.

33
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.830
Finally, we look at a few related
practices that helped to provide rules and

34
00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.200
standards that guide how data is used.

35
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.870
Namely data governance,
data privacy and data quality.

36
00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.280
By the end of the module you should be
able to identify the people who worked in

37
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.030
your data environment and
understand what they do.

38
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.330
You should also be able to recognize
what type of structure you have and

39
00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.540
perhaps whether it's the best one for
your organization.

40
00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.290
Additionally, you should be able
to describe the basic tenants of

41
00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.960
data governance, privacy and quality and

42
00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.706
generally how to apply
them in your organization.

43
00:02:07.706 --> 00:02:09.153
Surf's up so let's get at it.
