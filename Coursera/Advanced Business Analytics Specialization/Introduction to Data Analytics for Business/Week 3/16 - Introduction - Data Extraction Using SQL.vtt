00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:02.290
Welcome to Module 3.

2
00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:06.390
In this module we'll focus on data
extraction from relational databases using

3
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.390
structured query language or SQL.

4
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.400
Up till now, we've been focused mostly on
thinking about analytical problems and

5
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.420
understanding where data comes from and
how we capture and store it.

6
00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.210
Now we take our first step
in actually working with and

7
00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.590
manipulating the data we need
in order to execute an analysis.

8
00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.220
As an analyst the ability to extract data
from a database yourself, is one of those

9
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.050
skills that can really enhance
the value you bring to an organization.

10
00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.310
It makes you more efficient and
more effective, since you gain a much

11
00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.799
deeper level of understanding of the
database itself and the data it contains.

12
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.010
There are two thing about SQL that make it
really great to learn in specialization

13
00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.140
like this one.

14
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.030
First, it's incredibly simple.

15
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.170
By the time we finished this module,
you'll learn the basic commands and

16
00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.480
operations that drive 80% to 90% of
the SQL coding we see in data analytics.

17
00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.470
Secondly, SQL is almost ubiquitous.

18
00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.780
While there are many other languages
that companies use either directly or

19
00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.850
indirectly to support analytics,
SQL is easily the most common.

20
00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.170
And there's a really good chance you'll
find it in just about any organization

21
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.100
working with databases.

22
00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.350
And even if you don't end up using SQL,

23
00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.000
you can benefit from learning the thought
process that goes into writing it.

24
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.560
It's the same thought process you'll need
to go through regardless of how you get

25
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.710
data out of your databases.

26
00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.570
By the end of this module you should
be able to construct simple to

27
00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.810
moderate SQL queries using
a set of basic commands.

28
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.950
Namely select, from, where,
group by, having, and order by.

29
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.990
Combine or stack data from multiple
tables using join and union commands.

30
00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.720
Enhance queries using relational,
arithmetic, and logical operations, and

31
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.330
build even more complex queries
by utilizing sub queries.

32
00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.470
This will be your first chance to get your
hands dirty with some actual data work.

33
00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.490
So I hope you're as excited as I am.

34
00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.578
And I hope you'll love
writing SQL as much as I do.
