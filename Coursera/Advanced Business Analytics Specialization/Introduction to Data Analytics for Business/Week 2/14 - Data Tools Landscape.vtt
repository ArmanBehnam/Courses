1
00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:04.710
In this module, we spent quite a bit of
time talking in general terms about how

2
00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.630
data is stored and manipulated.

3
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:09.940
We've tried to avoid focusing too
much in any one type of software or

4
00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:11.220
software vendor.

5
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:11.720
The reason for

6
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.820
this is simply is that different
organizations use different tools.

7
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.340
Our objective in this course is to give
you a strong foundation in data analytics

8
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.130
that you can apply anywhere.

9
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.900
In this video however,
we're going to try and

10
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.420
give you a lay of the land in terms
of real data analytics tools.

11
00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.360
This means we're going to name names.

12
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.800
A few caveats before we begin.

13
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.280
First, we're only going to show a subset
of the most popular software and

14
00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.630
software vendors that
you're likely to encounter.

15
00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.500
There are a lot more options out there.

16
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.580
And our focus on this subset shouldn't
be taken as an endorsement of

17
00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:41.960
only this group.

18
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.850
Secondly, we're going to focus on a
somewhat more traditional group of tools.

19
00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.360
If you've watched our other
video on big data in the cloud,

20
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.900
you've seen that there
are literally dozens of tools and

21
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.430
technologies that are emerging
to manipulate and analyze data.

22
00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.880
While you definitely want to get familiar
with those, you will almost certainly need

23
00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.389
to be able to operate in an environment
that uses more established tools as well.

24
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.940
Finally, the way we group these tools
is only one way to look at the world.

25
00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.120
Other folks may group these
tools in different ways or

26
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.690
take exception with how we've done it.

27
00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:11.190
That's okay.

28
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.810
I encourage you to learn as much
as you can about technology and

29
00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.350
reach your own conclusions about which
tools are best for which functions.

30
00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.460
Also keep in mind that these tools
are evolving all the time, and

31
00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.470
most vendors are trying to expand their
solutions to include more functionality.

32
00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.540
Okay, let's start by defining some classes
of tools that you're likely to encounter.

33
00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.110
Namely, database systems,
standard reporting tools,

34
00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.980
dashboarding tools, data visualization
tools, data exploration tools, and

35
00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.070
statistically modeling and
advanced programming tools.

36
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.440
Broadly speaking, this ordering of tools
begins with the most IT or development

37
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.520
centric, and moves towards tools that are
more analytic or exploratory in nature.

38
00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.300
We talked quite a bit about database
systems in our previous videos.

39
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.490
As a reminder,
these tools are used create, maintain, and

40
00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.520
extract data from databases.

41
00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.980
In this video, we'll focus on
the most popular options for

42
00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.470
relational database systems.

43
00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.980
Standard reporting tools are used to
provide stable repetitive use of data.

44
00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:12.960
Usually standard reports are created once
we've already identified a specific way of

45
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.740
looking at data that we think is
particularly useful or insightful.

46
00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.650
We use reporting tools to
automate the generation of these

47
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.980
reports on some periodic basis.

48
00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.510
Monthly, weekly, daily, hourly, so
we don't have to do it annually.

49
00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:27.420
These reports may or

50
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.810
may not provide some limited
manipulated functions like filtering or

51
00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.480
draw down capability, and they're usually
directed toward business and users.

52
00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.430
Standard reporting tools were some of the
first business intelligence tools created

53
00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.150
and have been around for quite a while.

54
00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.883
Although the level of sophistication and

55
00:02:42.883 --> 00:02:45.020
usability is increased
substantially overtime.

56
00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.220
The idea of dashboarding is
an extension of standard reporting.

57
00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.610
As more and more standard reports
are created in an organization,

58
00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.980
it becomes more difficult to isolate the
most important pieces of information that

59
00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.470
an executive or other decision maker
might need to make sense of the business.

60
00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.580
One solution to this problem is
to take a subset of reports and

61
00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.490
present them in one simplified
view that allows the most

62
00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:10.880
important metrics to be quickly
identified and interpreted.

63
00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.570
Dashboards also tend to
be a bit more dynamic and

64
00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:17.170
may present more timely information
than some standard reports.

65
00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.760
As the name suggests, the analogy
here is the dashboard in your car,

66
00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.450
which allows you to see the most important
things that are going on as you drive.

67
00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.920
Executive dashboarding emerged from
the executive information systems

68
00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.620
in the 1980s, but
really gained popularity in the 1990s.

69
00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.090
But like standard reporting tools,

70
00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.020
the sophisticated dashboarding
tools continues to evolve.

71
00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.230
While we may or
may not spend time developing reports or

72
00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.700
dashboards, the idea of data visualization
is squarely within the domain of the data

73
00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.670
analyst data visualization is the process
of arranging data in such a way that we

74
00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.910
can more easily see what's going on and
draw conclusions based on what we see.

75
00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.630
The idea of data visualization has
been around for hundreds of years, but

76
00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.220
it's only been in the last decade or so
that the class of sophisticated tools

77
00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.179
explicitly designed to make sense of large
amounts of complex data have emerged.

78
00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.142
These tools both the facilitate the
aggregation and manipulation of data and

79
00:04:10.142 --> 00:04:14.580
provide a spectrum of advance
visualization techniques to the user.

80
00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.160
In fact, these tools are quickly
becoming the work course applications in

81
00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.040
many business analytics organizations.

82
00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.310
Data exploration is an intelligent
extension of the idea of data

83
00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:25.760
visualization.

84
00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.480
Data exploration tools seek to
proactively guide the data analyst

85
00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.120
by automatically scanning data and
providing cues or

86
00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.750
suggestions on what thing the data
analyst might look at next.

87
00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.860
They also provide advanced navigation
tools that allow the analyst to

88
00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.960
efficiently explore a data set.

89
00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.130
These capabilities are most often
built into some of the same tools that

90
00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:45.599
specialize in data visualization.

91
00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.100
The last class of tools we'll introduce
are statistically modeling and

92
00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.950
advanced programming tools.

93
00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.750
These tools are used to
execute highly sophisticated

94
00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.090
analytical procedures on data,
often using statistical techniques.

95
00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.520
They're the core tools of data scientists,
and

96
00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.330
a key part of the data
analyst toolkit as well.

97
00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.260
They range from highly integrated
interface driven software packages to raw

98
00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:12.170
programming environments where analysts
can manipulate data directly using one or

99
00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:13.490
more programming languages.

100
00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.680
Now that we've defined some of
the classes and tools that are out there,

101
00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.140
let's try and map them out and get
a sense for who some of the players are.

102
00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:24.220
Again the way we'll do this is just
one way of looking at the world.

103
00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:27.160
You may find another view that makes more
sense to you based on your experience.

104
00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.680
I'll start by outlining two dimensions,

105
00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.410
on the horizontal we use the same
classifications spectrum we just covered.

106
00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:37.080
We'll start on the data based
tools on the left and proceed

107
00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.320
all the way to the statistical modeling in
advance programming tools on the right.

108
00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.620
On the vertical, we use something
that's a little more subjective.

109
00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.330
One way I like to think of tools
is by a combination of their

110
00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:50.920
technical sophistication and
general cost range.

111
00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:54.000
For example, you may have tools
that are very expensive or

112
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.680
built on open source software.

113
00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.550
But they usually have some limitations or
require more overhead to use.

114
00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:02.620
Alternately, you might have tools
that are intended to be large scale

115
00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:06.320
enterprise software suites that come
with establish support structures and

116
00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:08.990
other benefits that
are reflected in their cost.

117
00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:12.320
All place tools in the spectrum based
on general market position in my own

118
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:16.340
experience, but recognize that many of the
companies that produce these tools provide

119
00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.400
options and various price points and
support levels.

120
00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:21.890
Let's start with database systems.

121
00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:24.010
Arguably the simplest,
least expensive, and

122
00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:27.460
most widely available database
software is Microsoft Access.

123
00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:30.980
While most large organizations implement
much more sophisticated systems for

124
00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:34.790
enterprise data needs, you're likely to
come across quite a few localized business

125
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:37.440
functions that use access for
some purpose.

126
00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.870
There are also a couple of reading open
source database software applications

127
00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:44.410
namely MySQL and
PostgreSQL which provide a flexible and

128
00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:47.370
inexpensive option for creating databases.

129
00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:50.030
All Open Source source options
are quickly gaining popularity,

130
00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:53.880
the dominant database applications
are still provided by a few big names.

131
00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:58.910
There's Microsoft SQL server,
IBM DB2, Oracle and Teradata.

132
00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:01.660
It's very likely that at
least some of the data you're

133
00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:04.320
using in analysis is stored in one or
more of these systems.

134
00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:07.990
Let's move on standard reporting.

135
00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:10.840
I'm going to introduced one more
convention of this landscape diagram that

136
00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:13.376
reflects how some of this
tools span more than one area.

137
00:07:13.376 --> 00:07:16.920
And to give a sense for
how specific tools are evolving,

138
00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:21.460
I'll use an arrow like this one extending
from the Access icon to reflect that

139
00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:25.960
Access provides some reporting capability
in addition to database functionality.

140
00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:30.640
Not surprisingly the tool that embodies
this idea in spades is Microsoft Excel.

141
00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:33.020
Excel is a very flexible
tool that can be used for

142
00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:37.610
almost any function on our spectrum with
low to medium degrees of sophistication.

143
00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:40.540
It is also used in almost every
organization that exists today,

144
00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:45.190
and it's understood by perhaps more people
than any other application we'll discuss.

145
00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:48.980
Microsoft also has a complimentary
added to Excel called power pivot,

146
00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:52.579
which extends the business intelligent
capabilities of the basic Excel software.

147
00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:57.040
Most companies however use something
a bit more sophisticated for

148
00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:58.880
their standard reporting needs.

149
00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:01.730
A leading open source tool is
called Pentaho, but again,

150
00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:05.760
the market is led by some long standing
software tools by large vendors,

151
00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:11.619
namely SAP's Business Objects, Oracle's
OBIEE, IBM's Cognos, and MicroStrategy.

152
00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:16.930
For dashboarding, some of the early
products were Xcelsius and crystal reports

153
00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:21.410
both of which are currently part of SEP
business intelligent product portfolio.

154
00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:24.450
All the major standard boarding
tools as well as Pentaho

155
00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:28.310
have extended functionality that
facilitate the creation of dashboards, and

156
00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:31.780
often the tools of choice of how we
automated and distributed reports and

157
00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:34.460
dashboard delivery at
the end of process level.

158
00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:37.410
However, there are somewhat
newer class of tools

159
00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:40.670
that attack the idea of dashboarding
from an analytical perspective

160
00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:43.920
versus from the data where it
has reporting perspective.

161
00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:49.330
Tools like TIBCO Spotfire, Tableau,
QlikView and Microsoft's Power BI look to

162
00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:53.460
enable data exploration and visualization,
and then enable the deployment and

163
00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:58.290
distribution of those visualizations to
a broader user group including executives.

164
00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:02.330
Where these tools are evolving most
rapidly is in the data exploration space

165
00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:04.200
by making an increasingly easier and

166
00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:07.630
more intuitive to find the most
interesting insights in the data.

167
00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:11.720
Some of these tools like Spotfire, have
gone so far as to explicitly integrated

168
00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:15.160
more advanced statistical tools
into the same software application.

169
00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:19.780
In Spotfire's case the statistical power
the S-Plus application is integrated into

170
00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:24.270
their software suite, however, there are
number of powerful standalone statistical

171
00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:27.750
applications that are broadly used
in data Science and analytics.

172
00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:31.780
One that is rapidly gaining popularity
is the open source R application.

173
00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:35.912
R is very flexible, it can be incorporated
into a lot of other processes and

174
00:09:35.912 --> 00:09:37.260
applications.

175
00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:41.770
In fact, many of the other tools in this
landscape are increasingly being enhanced

176
00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:44.770
to allow or incorporate some use of R.

177
00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:48.710
There's also a very large installed base
of users in a number of other more refined

178
00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:54.570
applications like SAP predictive
analytics, IBM's SPSS, and SAS.

179
00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:58.370
Generally speaking, as we move from
stand reporting to dashboarding

180
00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:00.770
to data visualization and exploration and

181
00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:04.710
to statistical modeling, we find that the
skill sets that the analyst using those

182
00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:09.660
tools become somewhat more sophisticated
and sometimes more programming intensive.

183
00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:10.520
For example,

184
00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:15.370
to use R we typically need to write at
least some code to execute a procedure.

185
00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:17.880
In the extreme case,
we may not even want or

186
00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:20.490
need any of the software
to operate on the data.

187
00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:22.810
We may actually want the high
degree of control and

188
00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:27.170
performance that comes with writing code
directly against the data ourselves.

189
00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:29.710
There are many languages that
one can use to do this, but

190
00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:32.950
two of the most popular are Python and
Java.

191
00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:35.750
Manipulating data directly in
code can allow us to perform

192
00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:39.090
certain operations that are not
supported in other software.

193
00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:42.430
And can allow us to embed analytical
operations directly into other

194
00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:43.940
applications.

195
00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:48.110
So what we've created here is a landscape
of some of the most popular data tools.

196
00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:51.254
Hopefully, you come away from this video
with a better sense of the type of

197
00:10:51.254 --> 00:10:53.132
activities these applications support and

198
00:10:53.132 --> 00:10:56.598
can recognize how they're used when you
come across them in your organization.
