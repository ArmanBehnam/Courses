00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:02.566
Welcome to module two.

2
00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:06.053
In module one we focused on how to
think about analytical problems.

3
00:00:06.053 --> 00:00:09.528
And we presented a framework called
the information action value chain,

4
00:00:09.528 --> 00:00:12.760
which describes the overall
analytical process.

5
00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.260
In this module,
we'll focus on analytical technologies, or

6
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.340
the tools that are used to store,
manipulate, and analyze data.

7
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.929
We'll start by learning about the various
ways in which data can be stored.

8
00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:27.437
We'll then introduce a number
of concepts related to data and

9
00:00:27.437 --> 00:00:31.360
analytical environments,
including big data, cloud computing.

10
00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.134
Data virtualization and federation,
in memory computing, and

11
00:00:35.134 --> 00:00:37.430
in database analytics.

12
00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.280
We'll spend some time understanding
a very popular storage

13
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.620
mechanism called the relational database.

14
00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.362
Which will prepare us for module three,
which is entirely dedicated to learning

15
00:00:47.362 --> 00:00:50.302
how to extract data from
these type of databases.

16
00:00:50.302 --> 00:00:53.606
Finally, we'll present a landscape
that will help us understand

17
00:00:53.606 --> 00:00:56.980
the spectrum of analytical tools
available to us as data analysts.

18
00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.473
And we'll provide an overview of some of
the more common ways that these tools

19
00:01:00.473 --> 00:01:02.150
are used in the analytical process.

20
00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.590
By the end of this module,

21
00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:08.490
you should have a good understanding of
what types of analytical tools exist and

22
00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.900
what types of activities
are suited to each type of tool.

23
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.392
As a practical matter, you should be able
to examine your own data environment and

24
00:01:16.392 --> 00:01:19.795
understand how it works and
how you can make the best use of it.

25
00:01:19.795 --> 00:01:21.169
Together with module one,

26
00:01:21.169 --> 00:01:25.170
our broader objective here is to ensure
that you have a solid thought process and

27
00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.294
a good foundation of knowledge
about your data environment.

28
00:01:28.294 --> 00:01:31.924
Because regardless of the tools you use,
the most important tool of the data

29
00:01:31.924 --> 00:01:34.830
analyst is the one right
here between your ears.

30
00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:35.957
Hope you enjoyed the module.
