00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:04.700
In previous videos we explored
the information action value chain, which

2
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.860
starts with events in the real world and
ends with an action in the marketplace.

3
00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.370
In this video we start diving into
that value chain in more detail

4
00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:13.970
beginning with events in the real world.

5
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.150
It turns out that just about anything in
the real world can be turned into data.

6
00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.660
Technology is continually
allowing us to push the envelope,

7
00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.040
both in terms of the types and
information that can be captured and

8
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.520
the sheer volume of data that
can be captured and stored.

9
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.560
We couldn't possibly cover everything
that might be available to you

10
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.765
with the analyst, but what we will do
is outline some of the major types of

11
00:00:36.765 --> 00:00:40.399
real-world phenomena that might be of
interest to you and your business.

12
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.860
We'll break our discussion into two parts.

13
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.780
First, we'll talk about people.

14
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.790
Who they are and what they do.

15
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.340
Then we'll talk about things,
objects, and the environment.

16
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.300
Let's start with people.

17
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.570
People have characteristics that describe
them, like age, gender, nationality,

18
00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.080
ethnicity, race, marital and
familial status.

19
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.710
Educational level,
socioeconomic status, housing status.

20
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:05.650
The list goes on and on.

21
00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.980
People also have preferences,
beliefs, attitudes and

22
00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.080
motivations that help define who they are.

23
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.730
They may not be obvious or
easy to get, but they do exist and

24
00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:18.810
there are methods of capturing
information about them.

25
00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.050
We often group these characteristics into
a few broad categories that you might

26
00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.900
encounter in a business context.

27
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.200
Namely demographics,
psychographics and technographics.

28
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.232
Demographics broadly describe population
level characteristics like age,

29
00:01:35.232 --> 00:01:37.222
gender, nationality, etc.

30
00:01:37.222 --> 00:01:40.870
And are the most widely used
characteristics in a lot of different

31
00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.007
types of analysis.

32
00:01:42.007 --> 00:01:46.610
Psychographics speak more to people's
opinions, attitudes, and interests.

33
00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.330
They include preferences,
likes and dislikes, and

34
00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.420
tend to reveal insights about why
people do the things they do.

35
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.080
Technographics are really a subset of
psychographics which focus on how people

36
00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.880
approach technology and
what their motivations and

37
00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.880
attitudes are about using new and
existing technologies.

38
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.900
Certainly there are other
categories of attributes.

39
00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.750
In some areas, like healthcare,

40
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.770
the notion of personal attributes can go
a lot deeper to include a whole host of

41
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.570
physical attributes that might be
important to a business organization.

42
00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.800
Some of these characteristics
also imply events.

43
00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.570
Age implies birthdays,
marital status might imply a wedding or

44
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.280
anniversary, education
implies graduations.

45
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.210
All of these related events could
be of interest to the business and

46
00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:32.810
to the analyst.

47
00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.246
In addition to characteristics,
people also have identifiers.

48
00:02:36.246 --> 00:02:39.948
They have names, addresses,
telephone numbers, email addresses,

49
00:02:39.948 --> 00:02:41.621
Facebook and Twitter handles.

50
00:02:41.621 --> 00:02:44.936
And all sorts of unique attributes
that might be used to identify them in

51
00:02:44.936 --> 00:02:46.660
the real world.

52
00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.190
Let's shift slightly from people
themselves to where those people are and

53
00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.510
where they go.

54
00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.040
We can think about this
in at least two ways.

55
00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.380
First, we can think about
the idea of physical location.

56
00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.960
Where people live, how they move, and
where they are at any given time.

57
00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.684
People commute, they travel.

58
00:03:03.684 --> 00:03:07.040
And they have natural patterns of
movement in their day-to-day lives.

59
00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.090
We can also think about
location in the virtual sense.

60
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.740
People can navigate through the online
environment via web browsing.

61
00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.390
They can frequent certain websites or

62
00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.950
be present at a given time
at an online location.

63
00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.000
Of course, they are also accessing the web
from some physical location as well.

64
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.940
And thanks to mobile connectivity,
they may even be moving while doing it.

65
00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.100
In many industries,
some of the most important and

66
00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.400
frequently used information
is around transaction or

67
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.330
events that involve an exchange
between people or businesses.

68
00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.990
Far and away,

69
00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:41.030
the most common transaction of interest
in business analytics is a purchase,

70
00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.290
the event where someone buys a product or
service that our company is selling.

71
00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.780
But there are a wide array of other
types of transactions, like investments,

72
00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.572
transfers, execution of contracts,
accounting entries.

73
00:03:52.572 --> 00:03:56.160
Or more detailed elements of purchase
transactions, like placed orders or

74
00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.990
payment processing events.

75
00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:02.110
A closely related idea is that
of consumption, or usage.

76
00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.550
Often how people use our products and
services, or

77
00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:06.400
how much of them they consume, is equally,

78
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.900
if not more, important than the buying of
those products and services themselves.

79
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.320
Many of these examples are in
telecommunications and

80
00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:17.650
utilities, where we are interested in
things like minutes of use or megabyte or

81
00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.750
data consumption, or
electricity, gas or water usage.

82
00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:26.600
The volumes and patterns of usage behavior
often provide key insights to a business.

83
00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.290
We also recognize that people
interact with our business and

84
00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.250
with each other in the real world.

85
00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.840
We may interact with people
through mass marketing or

86
00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.500
traditional outbound communications
like mail, email, text, or phone calls.

87
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.590
Businesses often have customer care
organizations that interact with customers

88
00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.690
in call centers or via online chats.

89
00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.290
Businesses also participate in social
media interactions with customers via

90
00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.730
social networking sites and services.

91
00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:54.690
Of course, the vast majority of
interactions that people have are not

92
00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.920
directly related to our business.

93
00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.360
People are in constant
communication with each other,

94
00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.142
using many of those same mechanisms.

95
00:05:01.142 --> 00:05:03.245
They form communities and networks,

96
00:05:03.245 --> 00:05:06.406
establishing patterns of
behaviors of communication.

97
00:05:06.406 --> 00:05:10.911
Like personal characteristics, not all of
these interactions can be observed but

98
00:05:10.911 --> 00:05:15.416
an increasingly large percentage of key
interactions actually can be observed and

99
00:05:15.416 --> 00:05:17.660
can be used in our analysis.

100
00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:21.590
Okay, while not exhaustive,
that's a pretty broad look at people.

101
00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:25.270
Let's pivot to things in the real world
that are not people, like objects and

102
00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:28.030
environmental events,
where some of the same ideas apply.

103
00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:33.640
Like people, objects including the
products we sell, have characteristics.

104
00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:37.350
Size, shape weight, features and
functions, color, and

105
00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:41.040
a potentially long list of technical
specifications or other qualifiers.

106
00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:45.290
Objects also have a physical location and
can move.

107
00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:47.540
Think about the delivery
path of a package or

108
00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:50.040
how your luggage moves
when you take a flight.

109
00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:54.280
Consider the way raw materials might enter
a factory and are progressively passed

110
00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:58.060
through an assembly line,
turned into a product and warehoused.

111
00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.120
We also tend to sell products in and

112
00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.045
through sales channels like stores or
websites.

113
00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:07.920
There are a wide variety of supply chain,
logistics, and transportation applications

114
00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:10.780
where the location and movement of
objects are critical to the function of

115
00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:14.910
a business, and where there
are opportunities for data analytics.

116
00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:18.160
Furthermore, objects don't just exist and
get moved around.

117
00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.400
They can actually do things,
especially in machines.

118
00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:26.100
Engines run, air conditioning systems
maintain temperatures and turn on and off.

119
00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:28.920
Computers run programs and process data.

120
00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:32.010
Advances in sensor and
communications technology

121
00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:36.410
are allowing a vast mount of machine data
to be generated and made available for

122
00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:38.249
monitoring and analytic application.

123
00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:44.030
Ideas like the connected home, and even
the intersection of machine data and human

124
00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:49.040
physical data, like the connected body,
are becoming more and more prevalent.

125
00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:52.445
Beyond people and objects, there
are still a host of other natural and

126
00:06:52.445 --> 00:06:56.329
non-natural events and phenomena that
can have an influence on our business.

127
00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:01.000
On one side there are things like seasons,
temperature and weather.

128
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.250
Tides and currents, major events like
earthquakes and a variety of other

129
00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:10.090
biological or cosmic phenomenon that
occur in the natural environment.

130
00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:13.520
There are also non-natural events or
patterns that are initiated or

131
00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:14.990
influenced by people.

132
00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:19.890
Like weekdays and weekends, holidays,
major sporting events, gatherings,

133
00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:23.810
traffic accidents, elections,
war, and conflicts.

134
00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:26.380
And there are events with natural and
non-natural drivers.

135
00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:28.860
Like outbreaks of disease or famine.

136
00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:33.440
Both natural and non-natural events can
have a significant impact on a business.

137
00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:37.500
Think about the impact of weather on air
travel or the impact of a major event

138
00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:42.100
like the Superbowl or World Cup on
television viewership or internet usage.

139
00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:45.810
The impact of major world events can
obviously have an enormous impact on

140
00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:48.090
people as well as businesses.

141
00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:50.500
The most important takeaway
from all of this of course,

142
00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:53.520
is the recognition that just about
everything you will be looking at as

143
00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:57.040
a data analyst starts as
something in the real world.

144
00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:00.491
The second thing you should appreciate at
this point is that there are an awful lot

145
00:08:00.491 --> 00:08:02.989
of things out there for
you to potentially access and use.
