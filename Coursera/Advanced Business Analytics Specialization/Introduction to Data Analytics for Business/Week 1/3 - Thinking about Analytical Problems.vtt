00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:05.080
In this video, we start our journey in
the business analytics by learning how to

2
00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.350
think about analytical problems.

3
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.230
If you're watching this video chances
are you already have an analytical mindset

4
00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.050
in a inquisitive nature.

5
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.920
That's great, because the best analyst are
people who really love understanding how

6
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.640
things work and
who can create clarity out of chaos.

7
00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.400
Knowledge and experience are key
to the analytical process.

8
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.190
And you apply a variety of skills and

9
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.060
analytical method to
the problems you solve.

10
00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.470
However, what happens all too often is
that the analysis doesn't lead anywhere.

11
00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.780
Meaning that it doesn't
stimulate action or

12
00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.900
change an action that would
have taken place anyway.

13
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.800
In these cases we question whether
we should have done analysis

14
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:42.399
in the first place.

15
00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.930
There's also a key distinction between the
analytics we do in the business world and

16
00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.120
the analytics that might be
done in science in Academia.

17
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.840
In business, we need a clear
return on the investment we make

18
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.780
in analytical people and
the tools that support them.

19
00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:58.925
And knowledge itself,

20
00:00:58.925 --> 00:01:02.810
while certainly valuable,
doesn't justify that an investment unless

21
00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.490
we can show it making a difference in
the decisions we make to run the business.

22
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.740
We also operate in a resource
constrained environment.

23
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.670
There is never enough time or money
to do all the things we'd like to do.

24
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.980
So we need to be focused in determining
what things we do and how we do them.

25
00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.350
The good news is that there's a pretty
simple principle that we can apply to make

26
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.170
sure that our analytical process
is efficient and effective.

27
00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:31.630
Specifically we think backwards, meaning
we start with the decision we want to make

28
00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.200
then we consider the information
needed to make that decision.

29
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.720
It's an idea crossly related to
the hypothesis drive approach used in

30
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.290
scientific reasearch.

31
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.420
Where we start with something
specific we think is true,

32
00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.390
then we design an experiment to test
the hypothesis that it really is true.

33
00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.180
To do this effectively, you need context.

34
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.450
You need to understand enough
about the business and

35
00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.210
about how decisions are made to
understand what's really important, and

36
00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.570
what's most likely to sway
a decision one way or the other.

37
00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.140
The first question to ask is whether
you can perform an analysis that will

38
00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.740
actually influence a meaningful decision.

39
00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.960
If you can say something like
if my analysis shows outcome

40
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.280
x I'll do one thing, and if it shows
outcome y I'll do something else, and

41
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.690
the choice I make matters,
then you're in good shape.

42
00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.790
If you discover that you probably make the
same decision regardless of the outcome or

43
00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.830
that the decision itself really
isn't all that important

44
00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.949
then you should reconsider
investing in an analysis.

45
00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.440
The next thing you should think about
is what the output of your analysis

46
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.630
would look like.

47
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.510
What sort of story would I
expect to be able to tell?

48
00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.490
How would I actually see outcome x or
outcome y in the data?

49
00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.330
Is there a specific chart or graph
that would illustrate the difference?

50
00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.450
The more specific you can
describe the output, the better.

51
00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.530
You might even sketch out what your final
presentation will look like in advance.

52
00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.340
Going through this process not only
assures that you have a really good idea

53
00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.600
of what you need to accomplish, it's also
a great way to share your intentions with

54
00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.420
other stakeholders in the process and
get their buy-in before work even begins.

55
00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.590
With the clear view of the output in mind,

56
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.570
you can start thinking
about the analysis itself.

57
00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:10.420
What methods will you need to apply?

58
00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.040
What tools will you need?

59
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.680
As we'll see later in the course,

60
00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.030
there are lot of different
ways to work with data.

61
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.310
Some of them simple, others more complex.

62
00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.660
A good guiding principle is
that simpler is often better.

63
00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.110
What is the most straight forward
way of getting to the answer.

64
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.670
While you shouldn't be afraid to use
complex methods when they're needed,

65
00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.450
over complicating your analysis can make
your results much harder to explain and

66
00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.220
harder to sell to stakeholders
when you're done.

67
00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.440
Okay, now that we know what kind
of analysis you intend to do,

68
00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.450
we need to consider where we're going
to get the data required to do it.

69
00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.960
We'll actually spend a good part of this
module talking about where data comes

70
00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:51.450
from, but there are a couple of key ideas
you want to consider at this point.

71
00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.370
First is it possible that
the whole thing is already done.

72
00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:59.290
Even the best analytic organization
sometimes duplicate work.

73
00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.220
Before investing a lot of time and
energy it's a good idea to

74
00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.910
ask around to see if someone else
has done this analysis before.

75
00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.810
Or if someone has already assembled
the data you need to do the analysis.

76
00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.100
If they have, you've just saved
yourself a lot of unnecessary work.

77
00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.210
Assuming you are on to something new,

78
00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:19.780
you want to outline each type of
data you need in your analysis and

79
00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.350
determine whether it exists within the new
organization and how you mean to get it.

80
00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.820
If you're lucky, everything you need
is already been brought into a common

81
00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.380
location like a data warehouse or
business intelligence environment.

82
00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.800
If so, it may just be a simple matter
of extracting it for analysis.

83
00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.918
However, it's often the case that not
everything you need is so easy to get.

84
00:04:39.918 --> 00:04:44.070
So you'll have to think about what steps
are necessary to actually get the data.

85
00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:45.670
And whether it's even feasible to do it.

86
00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.780
In some cases, you may need to reach
outside your business for the data.

87
00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.780
And there may be cases where you have to
set up an experiment or other research

88
00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.750
process to actually generate the data
required hired for analysis.

89
00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.880
You also need to think about the time
required to get the data and

90
00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.290
accomplish the analysis, and
ensure that the timeline and

91
00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:09.520
investment continue to make sense in terms
of the business decision you need to make.

92
00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.230
If you need an answer by Friday,
and the analysis will take

93
00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:16.250
two weeks to accomplish,
you need to find a different approach.

94
00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:18.610
Once you've determined that you
can get everything you need, and

95
00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.480
your timeline is good,
it's time to get going.

96
00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:25.320
You can now proceed with collecting data,
performing the analysis,

97
00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:26.680
getting the result and

98
00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.830
making that business decision that
leads to the action you hope to take.

99
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:32.110
As we go through the course,

100
00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:36.360
you'll find that we cover things a little
more traditionally, from beginning to end.

101
00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.460
In fact we'll introduce something called
the information action value chain.

102
00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.640
Which starts with events
in the real world, and

103
00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:44.960
ends with an action in the marketplace.

104
00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:48.300
But in terms of how you attack
the analytic problem in front of you,

105
00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.500
remember to think backwards.

106
00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.730
Start with the decisions you want to make,

107
00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:56.160
determine what analysis outputs
would help make that decision.

108
00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.010
Design the analysis that
creates those outputs, and

109
00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:02.890
determine what data is needed for
analysis and how to get it.

110
00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:05.410
Then and only then are you ready to begin.

111
00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:06.191
See you next time.
