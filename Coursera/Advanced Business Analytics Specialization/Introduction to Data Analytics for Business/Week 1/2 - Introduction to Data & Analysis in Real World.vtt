00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:02.370
Welcome to Module 1.

2
00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.680
In this module, we'll focus on data and
analysis in the real world.

3
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.940
We'll start by learning how to
think about analytical problems.

4
00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.660
Working backwards from
the decision we want to make,

5
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.060
then considering the information
needed to make that decision.

6
00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:18.180
We'll talk a lot about context.

7
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.930
We'll learn how to construct
a conceptual business model

8
00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.680
that describes the industry or
business that we're trying to understand.

9
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.961
Then we'll spend a fair amount of time
walking through something we call

10
00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:29.698
the information action value chain.

11
00:00:29.698 --> 00:00:33.818
Where we'll see how events in the real
world translate into data that we can then

12
00:00:33.818 --> 00:00:37.920
analyze and ultimately turn
into action in the marketplace.

13
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.460
In the latter part of the module,

14
00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.840
we start working through the elements
of the value chain itself.

15
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.430
First, by talking about
events in the real world.

16
00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.970
Then by discussing how those events
are captured by source systems.

17
00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.140
By the end of this module you should be
able to take an analytical problem and

18
00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.830
identify what data is needed to solve it.

19
00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.730
Where that data comes from,
how it is captured, and

20
00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.800
how it fits into the larger
context of your business.

21
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.810
In later modules,

22
00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:07.930
we'll cover analytical technologies, data
extraction and analytic organizations.

23
00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.100
Keeping with overall focus
of course one namely

24
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.835
all the critical things that happened
before and after the analysis itself.

25
00:01:14.835 --> 00:01:16.942
Hope you enjoy the module.
