1
00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:04.280
Previously, we covered how to
think about analytical problems.

2
00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.470
We learned how to think backwards
from the decision we want to make,

3
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.020
then consider the information
needed to make that decision.

4
00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:15.320
In this video, we continue to think about
context and introduce a way that you can

5
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.640
build context through the construction
of a conceptual business model.

6
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.970
So what is a conceptual business model?

7
00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.750
A conceptual business model is a diagram
that illustrates how an industry or

8
00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.170
business functions.

9
00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.630
It shows important elements
in the business, and

10
00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.820
maps out how those elements
relate to each other.

11
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.620
We'll walk through an example
of how to do this in a minute.

12
00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.898
But first, let's talk about why
we're going through this exercise.

13
00:00:38.898 --> 00:00:42.610
You could spend a lot of time and energy
learning the methods of data analytics.

14
00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.560
And we'll cover many of those methods
in this course in later courses.

15
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.570
However, it's equally important
that you understand what

16
00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.390
questions are worth asking.

17
00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.050
And of course, what the results of your
analysis actually mean in the real world.

18
00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.130
To do this, it's critical you have a good
understanding of how your business

19
00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:01.660
actually works.

20
00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.104
The process of constructing a conceptual
business model will force you to

21
00:01:05.104 --> 00:01:06.446
learn about your business.

22
00:01:06.446 --> 00:01:10.549
And will allow you to naturally discover
the key interactions that underlie your

23
00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:12.549
data, and which drive your analysis.

24
00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.440
So let's get started.

25
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.780
To illustrate how we build
a conceptual business model,

26
00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.160
I'll use a business I'm familiar with.

27
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.379
The in-flight connectivity business.

28
00:01:22.379 --> 00:01:26.280
In-flight connectivity is a service
that connects travelers on the aircraft

29
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.430
to the Internet on the ground.

30
00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.944
The way this works is a data link is
made from the aircraft to the ground

31
00:01:31.944 --> 00:01:35.850
using either an air-to-ground connection
or via a satellite connection.

32
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.640
A wireless network is then lit up inside
the plane, which allows customers to

33
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.970
connect to the Internet, basically,
a Wi-Fi hotspot in the sky.

34
00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.270
That's the technical side of things.

35
00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.130
Let's think about how
this works as a business.

36
00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.780
It's never a bad idea to start
with a customer, so let's do that.

37
00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.110
When a customer is using our service,
we call that a session.

38
00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:58.970
And of course,
this whole thing happens on the flight.

39
00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.800
Usually, we ask the customer to pay for
service, so

40
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.760
there's also a purchase event
that occurs prior to the session.

41
00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.500
And this also happens on
the flight most of the time.

42
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.410
So let's pause for a moment and
see how our diagram is shaping up.

43
00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.580
You'll notice I've simply drawn ovals with
the four elements we've discussed so far.

44
00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.080
Customer, Session, Flight and Purchase.

45
00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.660
And I've drawn lines between them to

46
00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.700
illustrate that they have
a relationship to each other.

47
00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.700
You'll also notice that some of my
lines have little forked ends on them.

48
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.140
What this illustrates is a one-to-many or
many-to-many relationship.

49
00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.320
For example,
one flight may have many customers but

50
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.300
one customer may also take many flights.

51
00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.400
One flight may have many purchase and
session events.

52
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.080
And one customer could have many
purchases and many sessions over time.

53
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.860
Some of these relationships are defined
by physical realities in the world.

54
00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.780
Others are the result of
business decisions we make.

55
00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.960
Going through the process of mapping this
out illustrates our understanding of

56
00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:58.950
the business and

57
00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.990
helps us see how certain types of events
may influence other types of events.

58
00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.950
This will help us later when we
start analyzing the data that these

59
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.300
events produce.

60
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.920
So let's keep going.

61
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.500
To use our service, the customer needs
a device, usually a laptop, tablet, or

62
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.250
mobile phone, and an application or
a web browser installed on that device.

63
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.810
We also sell a specific type of
product for Internet access.

64
00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.400
This might be a 30 minute pass,
Internet access for

65
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.320
the whole flight,
a monthly subscription product, or

66
00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.049
one that depends on the device itself,
like a mobile only pass.

67
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.450
While we may sell the product in the air,

68
00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.520
we may also sell it on
the ground before the flight.

69
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.830
This brings sales channel into play.

70
00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.730
And we may even offer promotions on
purchases of certain products through

71
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.200
certain channels.

72
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.750
On the other side of the model,

73
00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.110
we recognize that a specific
aircraft is flying any given flight.

74
00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.820
And that aircraft itself has
certain characteristics,

75
00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.530
like what kind of aircraft it is,
what airline operates it and

76
00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.160
what kind of connectivity equipment
is installed in the plane.

77
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.830
Likewise, any given flight
has its own characteristics,

78
00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:06.560
like where it is going to and

79
00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:12.190
from, how long it is, when it was supposed
to happen, and when it does happen.

80
00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.700
You may be starting to
see how this model is

81
00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.780
begging questions that
we might want to answer.

82
00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.500
What kind of devices do customers
use when accessing service?

83
00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.550
How much does pricing and promotion matter
in how many sessions are purchased?

84
00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.307
Does usage behavior change depending on
the type of aircraft, the airline, or

85
00:04:29.307 --> 00:04:31.710
whether a flight was on time or not?

86
00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.130
Our model allows us to see how each
question might be informed by the elements

87
00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:37.510
that influence it.

88
00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.450
Clearly, we could keep going here.

89
00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:43.420
Customers are really only a subset of
the passengers onboard the flight.

90
00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.350
And what about customers themselves?

91
00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:48.550
They also have characteristics
like demographics, preferences, or

92
00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.220
other identifiers.

93
00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.170
We also interact with customers.

94
00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:56.255
We contact them and they contact us
via a number of different channels and

95
00:04:56.255 --> 00:05:00.380
may use some select channels for
specific types of communications.

96
00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.350
There's also the technical side of things.

97
00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:05.480
There's a wireless network that influences
the customer experience through

98
00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.750
characteristics like speed and latency.

99
00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.278
And each session generates network traffic
that can be observed and measured.

100
00:05:11.278 --> 00:05:14.074
And there's a whole set of back end
network components that help to manage and

101
00:05:14.074 --> 00:05:15.570
control traffic.

102
00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:18.700
All of this of course,
is influenced by a commercial engine

103
00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:22.210
that may involve partnerships,
sponsorships, and advertising.

104
00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.350
And the whole system ties into a revenue
management and accounting process.

105
00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:28.840
Now we have a nice view of our business.

106
00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.890
We could probably take it even further,
but for now,

107
00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:33.100
let's think about what we do with it.

108
00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.270
As a data analyst,

109
00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.880
you'll be working with data that
describes all the things in your diagram.

110
00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.950
So it seems natural to start to look
at each element and wonder where

111
00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:45.210
the information about that element comes
from, and start to determine whether you

112
00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:50.146
have the ability to link things together
in the same way, using that data.

113
00:05:50.146 --> 00:05:53.530
In later videos we'll spend more time
talking about how these real world

114
00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:55.840
elements translate into analysis and

115
00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.230
action using something called
the information action value chain.

116
00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.580
As you can imagine,
these diagrams can get a bit complicated.

117
00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:07.310
Chances are you won't be able to sit
down and map all this out on day one.

118
00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:08.519
That's okay.

119
00:06:08.519 --> 00:06:12.241
You can start with the basic elements and
revise your model over time,

120
00:06:12.241 --> 00:06:14.716
as you learn more and
more about the business.

121
00:06:14.716 --> 00:06:16.916
Find the subject matter
experts in your business and

122
00:06:16.916 --> 00:06:19.610
ask them to share their understanding.

123
00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:23.340
Not only will that help you round out your
own knowledge, but you're bound to foster

124
00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:26.930
some good relationships that will make
you more effective down the road.

125
00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:30.440
Also, remember that
businesses change constantly.

126
00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:34.536
While the core elements of your model may
not change a lot, you'll probably want to

127
00:06:34.536 --> 00:06:37.654
make updates as details change and
new relationships emerge.
