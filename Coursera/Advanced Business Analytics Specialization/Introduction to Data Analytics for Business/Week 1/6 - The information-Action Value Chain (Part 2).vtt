00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:02.350
In our last video,

2
00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:06.300
we introduced the Information-Action
Value Chain, which starts with events or

3
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.760
characteristics in the real world, and
ends with an action in the marketplace.

4
00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.130
We covered the part of the value chain
that happens before we execute our

5
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.620
data analysis.

6
00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.060
Specifically, we learned about how events
in the real world are captured and

7
00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.180
turned into data by source systems.

8
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.550
And how data from many sources
are gathered in a common location and

9
00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.880
then extracted for analysis.

10
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.020
We ended by identifying
three types of analytics,

11
00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:35.000
Descriptive Analytics, Predictive
Analytics and Prescriptive Analytics.

12
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.530
In this video, we pick up where we left
off and discuss the analysis itself and

13
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.760
the steps that happen after
the analysis is done.

14
00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.250
Let's start by defining
the three types of analytics.

15
00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.340
Descriptive Analytics
as its name suggests,

16
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.420
helps us describe what things look
like now or what happened in the past.

17
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.070
The idea of course is to
use that information to

18
00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.480
better understand the business
environment and how it works.

19
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.430
And to apply that knowledge
along with business acumen

20
00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.150
to make better decisions going forward.

21
00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.730
Descriptive Analytics can take
the form of simple aggregations or

22
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:10.790
cross tabulations data.

23
00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.117
Simple statistical measures like means,
medians, and standard deviations.

24
00:01:15.117 --> 00:01:19.516
More sophisticated statistics like
distributions, confidence intervals and

25
00:01:19.516 --> 00:01:24.270
test of hypotheses or advanced
association or clustering algorithms.

26
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.340
Many of these ideas are covered in
course two of this specialization.

27
00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.460
So let's continue with the same example we
used in the last lesson, where we wanted

28
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.410
to describe the types of customers
that cancel their wireless service.

29
00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.610
This is a pretty clear application of
descriptive analytics, since we simply

30
00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.880
are trying to understand what types of
customers have cancelled up till now.

31
00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.910
Predictive Analytics help us take what we
know about what happened in the past, and

32
00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.430
use that information to help us predict
what will happen in the future.

33
00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.750
This almost always involves
the application of advanced statistical

34
00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.400
methods or other numeric techniques
such as linear or logistic regression.

35
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.260
Tree based algorithms, neural networks and

36
00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.810
simulation techniques such
as Monte Carlo simulation.

37
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.310
These type of techniques are also
covered in more detail in course two.

38
00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.310
Now, while we noted that our customer
cancellation example was primarily

39
00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.500
a descriptive analytics exercise.

40
00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.610
One could easily see us wanting to take
our thought processes a step further and

41
00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.660
actually use information about
who cancelled in the past

42
00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.190
to predict who might cancel in the future.

43
00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.730
We use predictive analytics
techniques to do that.

44
00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.650
The last class of analytics is what
we call Prescriptive Analytics.

45
00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.870
This type of analysis helps explicitly
link analysis to decision making

46
00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.570
by providing recommendations
on what we should do or

47
00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.790
what choice we should make to
achieve a certain outcome.

48
00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.520
It usually involves the integration
of numerical optimization techniques

49
00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.500
with business rules and
even financial model.

50
00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.690
Both predictive and prescriptive analytics
often use descriptive analytics'

51
00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.820
techniques in the exploratory phase or
to provide inputs to those models.

52
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.705
This idea is illustrated in course
three of the specialization.

53
00:03:04.705 --> 00:03:08.425
Again, one can see how Predictive
Analytics might play into our customer

54
00:03:08.425 --> 00:03:10.175
cancellation example.

55
00:03:10.175 --> 00:03:13.035
Let's say, that we actually
wanted to reach out to customers

56
00:03:13.035 --> 00:03:16.595
we think might cancel and
attempt some sort of intervention.

57
00:03:16.595 --> 00:03:20.025
Let's also say that we only have
enough money to reach to a subset of

58
00:03:20.025 --> 00:03:21.590
those customers.

59
00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.110
Prescriptive analytic techniques might
help us understand which customers we

60
00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.640
should target to maximize
return on our investment.

61
00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.640
In summary, there are a variety
of techniques available to

62
00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.910
you to use in accomplishing your analysis.

63
00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.020
Depending on the nature
of the business need and

64
00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.180
whether you're trying to understand
what happened, what will happen, or

65
00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.169
what you should do in the future.

66
00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.700
So now let's say, we've completed
the mechanics of our analysis.

67
00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:45.860
What's next?

68
00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.260
Are we ready to move on
to the next problem?

69
00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.360
In most cases, the answer is no.

70
00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.590
There's still much work to be done
before we get to that end goal

71
00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.020
of taking action in the marketplace.

72
00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.370
The first step in the latter half
of our journey is summarizing and

73
00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:00.919
interpreting the results of our analysis.

74
00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.260
While some analyses are straightforward,
that's not often the case.

75
00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.290
My analysis may have involved many steps
or took some unexpected twists and turns.

76
00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.080
I may have needed a second pass
based on some initial learnings.

77
00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.040
It's also not always clear what
the results of an analysis mean.

78
00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.500
This is why context is so
important in business analytics.

79
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.320
Without a clear understanding
of how the business works,

80
00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.080
it can be hard to understand
what an analysis is telling you.

81
00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:34.093
Mechanically, summarizing an analysis
usually involves identifying a few charts,

82
00:04:34.093 --> 00:04:35.164
graphs or tables.

83
00:04:35.164 --> 00:04:37.982
That make it as easy as possible
to see what's going on and

84
00:04:37.982 --> 00:04:42.770
supplementing those figures with a short
narrative that explains what they mean.

85
00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.920
Simplicity is key here.

86
00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.140
Chances are you have a ton of data and

87
00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:51.180
you've spent a lot of time looking
deeply at the data in all sorts of ways.

88
00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.080
But now is the time to pull
back out of the tails and

89
00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.800
distill all you've worked
down to a few key points.

90
00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.340
It's also when you determine
whether you have successfully

91
00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.790
answered the question
you intended to answer.

92
00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:04.190
Did you get sidetracked?

93
00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:05.880
Did you lose site of the goal?

94
00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.800
Or did you learn something important
that made you realize you were asking

95
00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.000
the wrong question to begin with?

96
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.610
Let's take our customer
cancellation example.

97
00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.480
I may have looked at dozens of
variables to determine what type of

98
00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:17.980
customers cancel.

99
00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.540
I may have created a stack
of cross tabulations, or

100
00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:24.910
tried a few aggression models,
to gain insights into what's going on.

101
00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:26.940
Let's say that among all those outputs,

102
00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.840
I discovered a strong relationship
between cancellation events and

103
00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.480
how long a customer has been a subscriber,
or a customer tenure.

104
00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.720
Specifically, I observe
a large spike in cancellations

105
00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.910
right after the two year point.

106
00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:44.760
Because I understand my business, I
immediately make a connection to the link

107
00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.289
of a service contract,
which is also two years.

108
00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.920
To summarize my analysis,
I might only need one graph.

109
00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.190
Let's say a plot of customer
cancellation rate by month,

110
00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:57.380
which shows a strong
peak in the 25th month.

111
00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:02.240
I note the peak and suggest that
customers are much more likely to cancel

112
00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.239
following the expiry of
their two-year contract.

113
00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:05.920
It turns out,

114
00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:10.860
the visualizing data in a compelling way
is as much of art as it is a science.

115
00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.230
In courses three and four,

116
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:16.370
we'll spend more time talking about how
to visualize different types of data.

117
00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:20.240
So for many analyst, this might be
the point in which the work ends.

118
00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.860
A different part of the organization
might pick up the results and

119
00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:26.140
be tasked with developing business
strategies and tactics to act on them.

120
00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.598
However, that's not always the case and

121
00:06:29.598 --> 00:06:32.276
as you become more senior and
more experienced.

122
00:06:32.276 --> 00:06:35.289
You should seek to be a part of
the decision making process and

123
00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:38.090
execution processes, which start here.

124
00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:39.800
As we discussed in the last video,

125
00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:44.100
analyses don't add a lot of value unless
we actually do something with them.

126
00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:46.070
Now that I understand what's going on,

127
00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:49.770
I can use those insights to create
a plan for how to take some action.

128
00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:53.070
Normally, this involves setting
a high-level strategy, then developing

129
00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:57.860
specific actions or tactics that I can
take to achieve some sort of outcome.

130
00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:01.910
I might develop multiple alternatives and
weigh the pros and cons of each.

131
00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:03.860
I might even develop a financial model or

132
00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:07.470
run a follow on decision analysis
to help me assess each option.

133
00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:11.440
In our customer cancellation example,
the desired outcome is simple.

134
00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.930
I'd like customers to stick around and
not cancel their service.

135
00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:17.859
This would be a tenet of my overall
customer retention strategy.

136
00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:23.080
My analysis has identified that a key
characteristic of cancelling customers

137
00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.460
is their service tenure.

138
00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:28.680
So I have a pretty good idea of when
each customer is most likely to cancel.

139
00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:31.300
I might consider communicating
to these customers and

140
00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:34.480
make them some sort of offer
to renew their contracts.

141
00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.909
My plan for this might have
a number of considerations.

142
00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:40.820
When exactly should I
reach out to customers?

143
00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:42.840
Before the contract expires?

144
00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:44.320
Right when the contract expires?

145
00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.610
After to contract expires?

146
00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:48.960
What should I offer customers to renew?

147
00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:49.790
How much will it take?

148
00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:52.390
How should I reach out?

149
00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:53.140
Mail?

150
00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:53.680
Email?

151
00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:55.110
Phone?
Text?

152
00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:56.710
Or should I wait for them to contact me?

153
00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:00.490
Should I just roll this out or
should I test it first?

154
00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:02.010
How confident am I in the outcome?

155
00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.810
How much impact do I think
the action will have?

156
00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:07.590
How am I going to measure the results?

157
00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:12.141
Well, I have the data I need to assess the
impact, that last question in particular

158
00:08:12.141 --> 00:08:16.380
is critical, since it maps out the needs
for the next round of data analysis.

159
00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:19.956
So let's assume we've used the results of
our analysis to construct the solid plan

160
00:08:19.956 --> 00:08:23.070
for action that we think will
have a meaningful impact.

161
00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:26.300
Chances are we're going to have to
convince someone to let us try it, or

162
00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:28.555
convince them to go and try it themselves.

163
00:08:28.555 --> 00:08:31.915
Often this personal organization
is the one with the funding.

164
00:08:31.915 --> 00:08:36.135
This is where we hit the next stage of
our framework, delivering the pitch.

165
00:08:36.135 --> 00:08:40.448
No matter how good your analysis is and
no matter how promising your plan is.

166
00:08:40.448 --> 00:08:43.985
There's a good chance you'll get no
where fast if you can't effectively

167
00:08:43.985 --> 00:08:47.180
communicate your results and
sell your proposal.

168
00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:48.040
In course four,

169
00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:51.430
we'll spend a lot more time talking
about how to communicate results.

170
00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:55.710
But for now, lets just touch on a couple
of ideas that are particularly important

171
00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:57.450
when analytics are involved.

172
00:08:57.450 --> 00:09:00.476
Given how hard you've worked on
the analysis up to this point, and

173
00:09:00.476 --> 00:09:01.944
the time you've devoted to it.

174
00:09:01.944 --> 00:09:05.388
You might be tempted to take your audience
through a journey of all the steps you

175
00:09:05.388 --> 00:09:07.280
took to get to this point.

176
00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:09.080
While there are always
exceptions to the rule,

177
00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:11.310
this usually isn't the best approach.

178
00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:14.640
Instead, think about how simple
you can make the message and

179
00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:17.250
still convey the essence of your idea.

180
00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:20.370
Use an executive summery to
quickly get to the point,

181
00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:22.670
then circle back to the details.

182
00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:27.190
Also, make sure to focus on the benefits
and business value of the plan.

183
00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:30.400
If you have an estimate of profit or
return on investment, use it.

184
00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:34.700
Pay attention to the quality of your
materials, whether they're slides,

185
00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:36.500
documents or other artifacts.

186
00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:37.460
Right or wrong,

187
00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:42.240
people tend to equate poor quality of
materials with poor quality of analysis.

188
00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:45.260
The best analysis and
presentation can be derailed

189
00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.760
by something as simple as a typo or
a bad number on a slide.

190
00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:50.690
Finally, know your staff.

191
00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:54.780
You don't necessarily want to have a lot
of details in your main presentation but

192
00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:59.310
be prepared to answer questions about your
approach, assumptions, methodologies and

193
00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:00.360
results.

194
00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:03.550
Try to anticipate what questions
your audience might ask or

195
00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:08.860
where they might in your logic and
be ready to respond clearly and precisely.

196
00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:11.060
Okay, assuming we've
done well on our pitch,

197
00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:13.940
we reach the final stage in our journey,
taking action.

198
00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:16.700
Congratulations, you now get
to see the fruit of your

199
00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:18.500
labor realized in the market.

200
00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:21.690
The nature of the action can take many
forms depending on your strategy and

201
00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:22.580
objectives.

202
00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:26.040
But, as we mentioned earlier, there's a
good chance that you'll want to understand

203
00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:30.830
the impact you've had which begins
the analytical process all over again.

204
00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:33.250
So let's recap what we've covered today.

205
00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:34.520
We recalled the last video,

206
00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:38.470
where we talked about the steps that
happen before our analysis begins.

207
00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:42.210
We described three types of analytics,
Descriptive, Predictive and

208
00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:44.600
Prescriptive, and
gave a few examples of each.

209
00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:49.259
We established the need to interpret
our analysis and summarize the results.

210
00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:54.650
We step slightly beyond he boundaries of
pure analytics and discuss how we turn

211
00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:57.750
the results of our analysis into
a strategy and plan for action.

212
00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:03.190
We outline some of the key considerations
in pitching your idea to decision makers.

213
00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:06.438
And finally, we realized our plan
by taking action in the market.
