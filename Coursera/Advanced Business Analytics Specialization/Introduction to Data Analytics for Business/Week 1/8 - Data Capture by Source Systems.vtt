1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.800
In a prior video we talked events and
characteristics in the real world and

2
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.200
outlined all sorts of ideas
about people objects and events

3
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.080
that might be interesting to our business
and have applications in analytics.

4
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.620
In this video we make the transition
from ideas to information,

5
00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.210
by talking about the systems
that actually capture the data.

6
00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:20.170
As an analyst,

7
00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.270
it's really helpful to understand where
the data you are working with comes from,

8
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.930
even if that data is being brought
together in a common location.

9
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.740
The truth is, there are thousands,

10
00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.860
if not more different types
of system that capture data.

11
00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.740
But what we try to do today is group
many of those systems into five broad

12
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.310
categories that you're most likely
to encounter in your company.

13
00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.842
Specifically, we'll talk about
core enterprise systems,

14
00:00:43.842 --> 00:00:46.820
customer and people systems, product and

15
00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.770
presence systems, technical operations
systems, and external source systems.

16
00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.040
Let's start with core enterprise systems,
these are usually large scale system

17
00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.990
that tie in directly to the financial
operations of a company.

18
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:03.830
They include things like billing and
invoicing systems that help

19
00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.280
manage purchasing transaction and
the collection of payments.

20
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.670
They also include enterprise reprise
planning or ERP systems, which are really

21
00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.307
broad systems to help manage business
processes on the back end of the business.

22
00:01:16.307 --> 00:01:20.910
As the name suggests, these systems
usually focus on the resources of

23
00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:26.210
the company whether they're financial
assets, materials, or production capacity.

24
00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.740
Supply chain management systems
focus specifically on the flow and

25
00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.550
storage of goods and
services through a system.

26
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.480
They help track raw materials and products
from their points of origin to their

27
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.830
points of consumption and provide insights
into throughput and inventory levels.

28
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.340
Just about every business has some
sort of accounting system which tracks

29
00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.160
all the financial transactions and
balances associated with the business,

30
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.310
including journal entries and
the general ledger.

31
00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.400
These systems help formally track assets,
liabilities, revenues, expenses and

32
00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.829
equity in accordance with
standard accounting practices.

33
00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.410
Finally, many businesses, like
communication companies and utilities,

34
00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:10.440
also rely on the large-scale tracking,
rating, and billing of usage information.

35
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.680
So they have systems that do that.

36
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.830
There's often a lot of overlap
in these enterprise systems.

37
00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.470
And you might find that one system
actually does a few of these

38
00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.110
functions in your business.

39
00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.610
For example,
it's not uncommon to see usage and

40
00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.030
billing integrated into a single system.

41
00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.570
And and ERP system might actually
perform a number of supply chain and

42
00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:29.550
invoicing functions.

43
00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.070
Let's move on to customer and
people systems.

44
00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.720
These systems can also be
critical to the business but

45
00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.150
focus more on people organizations
both inside and outside the company.

46
00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.820
The most expansive of these systems
are customer relationship management or

47
00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.520
CRM systems.

48
00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.480
CRM systems are used to track and
manage customer interactions across

49
00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.600
all touch points and throughout the
customer's life cycle with the company.

50
00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.320
Like ERP systems, they can be very broad
in terms of what they provide and can

51
00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.390
accomplish some of the same functions as
other types of systems in this category.

52
00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.830
Including the next type of
system we'll introduce.

53
00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.780
Customer care systems, customer care
systems typically are used by call

54
00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.770
center representatives or other personnel
that have direct contact with customers.

55
00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:19.280
They usually provide access to customer
account information, marketing offers or

56
00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.360
other functions needed to
help preserve customers.

57
00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.110
They also help capture a record of
what happened during the interaction

58
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:27.680
including notes and comments.

59
00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.100
When a business has a direct
sales function and sales people,

60
00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.480
they often employ lead management or
sales force automation systems.

61
00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.550
These systems help keep track of
potential customers called prospects

62
00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:45.400
from identification through the process
of turning them into customers.

63
00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.220
They also help to track sales performance
and in many cases tie into other

64
00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.360
systems to help manage orders, contracts,
or other sales related processes.

65
00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.680
Businesses often tie specific actions
directed at customers to customers

66
00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.110
themselves using campaign
management systems.

67
00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.960
These systems track the performance
of marketing campaigns or

68
00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:05.839
other types of intervention.

69
00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.120
They generally track who was contacted,
how and when they were contacted, and what

70
00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.030
type of offer or intervention was applied,
and what type of response was achieved.

71
00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.310
Again, these systems may tie
directly into broader CRM systems or

72
00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:25.500
sale systems to provide a more complete
view of customers and potential customers.

73
00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.080
There are a couple of slightly different
types of source systems that we'll talk

74
00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.570
about in this category
which also focus on people.

75
00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:37.170
The first of human resource systems,
these systems are internally focused and

76
00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:40.920
track information about the company's
employees including role and salary

77
00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:45.590
information, time and expense information,
perform it's management information and

78
00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.660
a variety of other attributes and
characteristics of the work forced.

79
00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.330
The last type of system we introduce
here is a bit industry specific but

80
00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.410
it is becoming increasingly
important in the macro sense as

81
00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:59.100
far as analytics are concerned.

82
00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.820
These are electronic health record or
electronic medical record systems.

83
00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.170
These types of systems were detailed
information about patients in

84
00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:09.950
the healthcare treatment and
services they received over time.

85
00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.700
Clearly the information to these
systems is very sensitive.

86
00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.720
We'll take more about data
privacy in a later video.

87
00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.290
But for certain application
they provide critical data

88
00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:22.920
used in the management of healthcare
organization and policies.

89
00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:29.090
Next in our lists of source categories
are products and present systems.

90
00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.360
We're really grouping these together for
convenience.

91
00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.080
They all tend to be support systems
that help different parts of a business.

92
00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.970
But are only loosely
related to each other.

93
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.450
The first are product management systems.

94
00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:44.070
As the name suggests these systems are
used to keep track of information about

95
00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:45.650
products themselves.

96
00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:49.390
They usually contain product attributes
and characteristics and may even have

97
00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:53.940
descriptive or sales facing information in
them that ties to customer facing systems.

98
00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.850
Content management systems
are a bit broader.

99
00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:00.550
They can be used for
all sorts of business purposes.

100
00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:03.880
But what they do is organize and
store content.

101
00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:07.070
Content can be texts, documents, images,

102
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:10.500
music, video,
where we just about anything.

103
00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:14.270
These systems generally make content
available to whatever part of the business

104
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:18.800
needs it from internal teams to customer
facing environments like websites.

105
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.820
The last type of system we'll talk
about in this category are online web

106
00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:26.130
management and analytic systems.

107
00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:28.300
These systems are pretty specific but

108
00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.200
just about every company
with a website has one.

109
00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.500
What these systems do is track how
users navigate through a website.

110
00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:38.910
Unlike the usage tracking systems we
talked about earlier which are geared

111
00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:43.660
towards billing, these type of systems are
really all about learning and analytics.

112
00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:47.800
They help identify issues with websites,
influence website design and

113
00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.070
measure activity and performance.

114
00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.800
Web analytic systems are a nice segue to
our fourth category of source systems.

115
00:06:54.800 --> 00:07:00.090
Technical operation systems, these systems
are usually very tactical helping to

116
00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:04.390
monitor processes or other systems to make
sure they are functioning properly and

117
00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:05.920
to identify issues when they occur.

118
00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:11.090
Process monitoring systems measure what's
happening in each stage of a process

119
00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:15.380
like a manufacturing sequence or
a series of software operations.

120
00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:16.050
Alarming and

121
00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:20.620
fault monitoring systems detect anomalies
in processes or machine operations and

122
00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:24.589
alert either people or other systems
that action or attention is required.

123
00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:30.110
Thickening and work for a management
systems help resources within a business

124
00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:32.670
track the steps required
to resolve an issue.

125
00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:35.750
Or otherwise complete a task that
might have multiple steps and

126
00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:37.240
involved different people or teams.

127
00:07:38.555 --> 00:07:42.045
Last, but certainly not least in
this category, are telematics and

128
00:07:42.045 --> 00:07:44.415
machine data processing systems.

129
00:07:44.415 --> 00:07:49.015
These systems capture data directly from
machines and devices wherever they are and

130
00:07:49.015 --> 00:07:53.435
feed all sorts of other systems,
including the ones we just described.

131
00:07:53.435 --> 00:07:56.815
This type of data is particularly
exciting to the analytic community,

132
00:07:56.815 --> 00:08:00.830
as ideas like the internet of things and
the connected home become a reality.

133
00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:04.390
This type of data is particularly
exciting to the analytic community.

134
00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:08.130
As ideas like the internet of things and
the connected home become a reality.

135
00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:13.550
So far all the systems we've talked
about exist inside the business or

136
00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:15.580
at least are specific to the business.

137
00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:18.640
However it probably goes without
saying that there's an enormous

138
00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:21.530
amount of information that
exists outside the business

139
00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:23.309
that you might bring to
bare in your analysis.

140
00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:27.570
Again, we couldn't possibly cover
everything in this video but

141
00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:30.440
in this last section we'll talk
about just a few of the most

142
00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:33.270
common categories of externally
available information.

143
00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:37.930
One of the most widely used sources
of external data is credit agency

144
00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:41.000
information, which ranges
from simple credit scores to

145
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.950
detailed credit history and
credit related attributes of consumers.

146
00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:47.940
Companies regularly use this
type of data to manage risk,

147
00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:50.040
when extending credit to customers.

148
00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:53.450
There are also external demographics and
segmentation sources,

149
00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:57.300
which companies typically use to augment
their own data about customers with

150
00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:01.080
additional attributes or characteristics
they can't measure themselves.

151
00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:03.980
This is an area that is
expanding really rapidly,

152
00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:07.370
with new data aggregation
companies popping up all the time.

153
00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:10.550
Who offer unique data points on
customers or customer segments.

154
00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:16.220
Finally, we can broadly classify any
information we obtained from partners or

155
00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:19.280
suppliers as an external source system.

156
00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:22.560
Obviously, this type of information
will be unique to your business.

157
00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:26.590
Okay, so we've covered quite
a lot in this video and

158
00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:30.040
the sheer variety of sources
can be a bit overwhelming.

159
00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:32.690
The reason we spend time
walking this is to give you

160
00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:35.520
a sense of how much is
potentially out there and

161
00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:39.090
what types of information may be
available to you who is the analyst.

162
00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:42.250
We also want to give you a bit of
a head start as you start thinking

163
00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:44.770
backwards from the problem
you're trying to solve

164
00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:47.839
by giving you a sense of where you might
look for certain things in your business.

165
00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:51.920
So let's briefly recap
where we've been today.

166
00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:56.470
We talked about core enterprise systems,
like billing, ERP, and accounting systems.

167
00:09:56.470 --> 00:10:00.690
We then covered customer and
people systems, like CRM, CARE, sales, and

168
00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:03.930
HR systems as well as
electronic health records.

169
00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:07.590
We touched on product, content,
and web management systems.

170
00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:11.840
We spend some time discussing technical
operation systems, including process,

171
00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:15.650
alarming, monitoring, workflow management,
and machine data systems.

172
00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:19.070
And finally, we looked outside
the business to external and

173
00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:20.890
third party systems.

174
00:10:20.890 --> 00:10:24.060
In the next set of videos, we dive
a little deeper into the technologies

175
00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:28.940
that fuel data analytics and we focus on
data storage and analytical tool sets.

176
00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:29.485
See you then.
