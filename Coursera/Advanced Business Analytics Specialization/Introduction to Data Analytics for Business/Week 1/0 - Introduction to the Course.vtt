00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:04.320
Welcome to the first course in the Data
Analytics for Business Specialization.

2
00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.200
Straight away I'm going to let
you in on a little secret,

3
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.570
we won't actually be doing
any analytics in course one.

4
00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:12.590
What's that you say?

5
00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.980
I thought I was here to learn analytics,
is this some sort of bait and switch?

6
00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.650
I promise you it's not.

7
00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.550
It turns out that if you want to be a
great data analyst in a real organization,

8
00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.080
there's a whole lot of other things you
need to understand to be successful.

9
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.110
In our experience most analytic
courses are great at covering methods.

10
00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.890
But they don't necessary prepare you to
apply them as part of an analytic team in

11
00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.120
the real world.

12
00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.800
This is what we focus on in course one,

13
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.270
specifically we are going to spend most
of our time speaking to two big ideas.

14
00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.550
The first idea is that there is an overall
process that describes how we think about

15
00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:46.870
analytical problems.

16
00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.910
And the path that information
takes from real world events

17
00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.070
to actions in the marketplace.

18
00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.020
The second idea is that there
are important elements that support

19
00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.219
the analytic environment, namely people,
tools, and organizational structures.

20
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.230
We'll break these ideas out and

21
00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.610
throw in a little skill-based
learning in four modules.

22
00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.530
In the first module,

23
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.815
we'll introduce that process called
the information action value chain.

24
00:01:09.815 --> 00:01:13.380
And we'll cover the first part
of that value chain in detail.

25
00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.410
In the second module, we'll talk about
analytical technologies and the tool

26
00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.409
sets that analysts and data workers use to
create and manage analytical environment.

27
00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:23.700
In the third module,

28
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.100
we'll go deep into one step in our
process in one particular type of tool.

29
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.280
By learning how to extract data from
relational databases using code called

30
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.380
Structured Query Language or SQL,
I'll be honest, that one is my favorite.

31
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.850
In the fourth module, we'll focus on
the people, the organization, and

32
00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.049
the policies that guide
analytics in real companies.

33
00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.150
Our hope is that by giving you a solid
foundation in how analytics really work.

34
00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.410
You'll be much more successful at
actually using those methods and

35
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.630
executing analytics to have a real
impact in your organization.

36
00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.430
Surfing is as much a mental
exercise as it is a physical one.

37
00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.150
You can be strong and flexible, but
if you can't see what's coming and

38
00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.480
interpret it correctly, you'll never catch
a wave, and you might even get hurt.

39
00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.300
When you learn how to surf you
spend a lot of time on the beach

40
00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.100
watching how the ocean works.

41
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.250
You need to understand the break,
you need to have the right tools for

42
00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.390
the right wave.

43
00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.990
You need to know who else is out there,
how they might behave, and

44
00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.760
what rules you need to follow
when surfing with others.

45
00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.820
You also discover that while
riding the wave is the fun part,

46
00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.780
most of the work is paddling out and
getting yourself in the right position,

47
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.830
to catch the wave in the first place.

48
00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.650
Above all else, surfing is a sport that
requires you to operate in harmony with

49
00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.840
your environment,
to reach your maximum potential.

50
00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.660
We want you to learn how to
understand your environment and

51
00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.060
how the practice of
analytics really works.

52
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.570
We want you to learn how to think
about analytical problems, and

53
00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.810
know how to approach them before you ever
step foot into the water, so to speak.

54
00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.985
So let's get started,
see you in module one.
