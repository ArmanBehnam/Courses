00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.150
Earlier, we talked about the importance of context in

2
00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:07.130
solving analytical problems and we learn how to construct

3
00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:09.320
a conceptual model of how an industry or

4
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.260
a business functions and map out how important elements relate to each other.

5
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.905
In this video, we take the idea of context a bit further.

6
00:00:16.905 --> 00:00:21.455
For you to be successful as an analytical professional in a real organization,

7
00:00:21.455 --> 00:00:25.480
it's critical that you have a good working understanding of where the data you

8
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.795
use comes from and what real world phenomena that data describes.

9
00:00:29.795 --> 00:00:32.270
It's also important that you understand how

10
00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.400
the results of your analyses will be used to make

11
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.000
decisions and ultimately how they will lead

12
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.105
to some specific action that is taken in the marketplace.

13
00:00:40.105 --> 00:00:42.015
Why is this so important?

14
00:00:42.015 --> 00:00:45.740
It turns out that the life of a data analyst is much more than just crunching

15
00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.745
numbers and applying analytical methods to discover meaning in the data.

16
00:00:49.745 --> 00:00:52.575
Sure, that part of the job is certainly a lot of fun,

17
00:00:52.575 --> 00:00:54.750
but the reality is that we spend an awful lot of

18
00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.015
time trying to understand how to get data,

19
00:00:57.015 --> 00:00:58.420
where does it come from?

20
00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:59.640
Where is it located?

21
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.115
How do I access it? Is it any good?

22
00:01:02.115 --> 00:01:05.770
Does it really represent the phenomenon I'm trying to understand?

23
00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.460
On the flip side, the job doesn't end once the analysis is complete.

24
00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.875
We need to be able to communicate the results of the analysis,

25
00:01:12.875 --> 00:01:17.415
make some sort of assessment that drives a decision and actually do something.

26
00:01:17.415 --> 00:01:20.635
Otherwise, why do we go through all the trouble in the first place?

27
00:01:20.635 --> 00:01:24.295
While the analysis itself might be the most interesting part of the job,

28
00:01:24.295 --> 00:01:27.800
the reality is a good part of your time and energy will probably be

29
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.660
spent on activities that happen upstream and downstream of the math.

30
00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.780
The better you are at understanding the value of each step,

31
00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.445
the more effective you will be as an analyst.

32
00:01:37.445 --> 00:01:39.830
The way we illustrate this idea is through

33
00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.345
a framework we call the information-action value chain.

34
00:01:43.345 --> 00:01:46.470
For those of you not familiar with the term value chain,

35
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.470
it's an idea that describes a sequential process where each step adds some sort

36
00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.780
of value to an object or an idea relative to a desired end point or outcome.

37
00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.515
In our case, we start with an idea or event in the real world

38
00:02:00.515 --> 00:02:04.810
and our desired outcome is the ability to take an action in the marketplace.

39
00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.560
In this video, we're going to focus on

40
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.745
the part of the value chain that happens before the analysis.

41
00:02:10.745 --> 00:02:12.630
In the next video, we'll focus on

42
00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.855
the analysis itself and what happens after the analysis.

43
00:02:15.855 --> 00:02:19.740
In both videos, we use an example to illustrate each step.

44
00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.415
So let's get started. We start with something in the real world.

45
00:02:24.415 --> 00:02:28.910
This can be an event like someone making a purchase or using a product or service.

46
00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.350
It could be the person or the product itself.

47
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.790
It could really be anything, even a natural

48
00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.540
event like a thunderstorm or the temperature outside.

49
00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.080
For any of these things to be useful to me as an analyst, I need to have data.

50
00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.100
There needs to be a mechanism captures

51
00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.060
the physical or digital representation of

52
00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.760
that real world phenomenon and puts it somewhere.

53
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.150
Usually this happens via some sort of front-end system

54
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.285
or a system that interacts directly with customers or physical objects.

55
00:02:55.285 --> 00:02:59.370
For now, let's assume that we are interested in one type of event,

56
00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.630
a wireless customer cancelling their telephone service.

57
00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.080
Let's assume our analysis will focus on

58
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.580
examining the number and types of customers that cancel.

59
00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.640
Most wireless services are subscription based and the cancel

60
00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.240
service it's often the case that I need to proactively contact my wireless provider.

61
00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.920
So let's say, I call my provider and after

62
00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.775
attempting a few offers they get me to stick around for a while.

63
00:03:22.775 --> 00:03:25.190
They ultimately agree to cancel my service.

64
00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.120
How is this event captured?

65
00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.880
What usually happens is that

66
00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.690
the customer service representative who is cancelling my service accesses

67
00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.230
the wireless companies billing system and changes

68
00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.440
some key attribute of my account to reflect that service should be disconnected.

69
00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.500
Among other things, there is usually

70
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.500
a cancellation date or other time stamp that represents the cancellation of it.

71
00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.215
It's that piece of data that will ultimately need to be available for our analysis.

72
00:03:50.215 --> 00:03:53.835
The point here is that for every event of interest in the real world,

73
00:03:53.835 --> 00:03:55.915
there needs to be a system that captures it.

74
00:03:55.915 --> 00:03:59.150
We often refer to these as source systems or

75
00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.735
the systems that serve as the sources for the data we want to get.

76
00:04:02.735 --> 00:04:04.310
There are many different types of

77
00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.595
source systems and we'll talk about them more in a later video.

78
00:04:07.595 --> 00:04:09.610
So now that I've got these events captured,

79
00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:10.850
I'm ready to start my analysis,

80
00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:12.790
right? Well not quite.

81
00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.960
It turns out that many source systems are great for capturing

82
00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:19.735
data but not so great for extracting data for analysis.

83
00:04:19.735 --> 00:04:24.010
A lot of source systems are what we call transactional systems or systems

84
00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.410
that are optimized for capturing transactional data one event at a time.

85
00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.870
Other systems capture information in

86
00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.630
an unstructured way that is not always suitable for analysis.

87
00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:39.020
Furthermore, if systems are critical to the real time operations of the business,

88
00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.215
we may not want analysts poking around and potentially disrupting or breaking them.

89
00:04:43.215 --> 00:04:46.000
Perhaps most importantly, my analysis might

90
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.230
require that I get information from more than one source system.

91
00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.700
In fact, it may be the case they need data from many sources system.

92
00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.930
It would be pretty tedious to have to go

93
00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.280
and grab information from all those sources one at

94
00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.590
a time and try to make sense of how they all

95
00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.755
fit together every time I had to do an analysis.

96
00:05:02.755 --> 00:05:04.350
For all these reasons,

97
00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:07.940
it's usually convenient to bring data together in some common location.

98
00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.810
Most often this location is a physical system called a

99
00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.805
data warehouse or enterprise data warehouse.

100
00:05:13.805 --> 00:05:18.175
Although there are a lot of emerging methods of doing this both physical and virtual.

101
00:05:18.175 --> 00:05:20.845
This is the third step in our value chain.

102
00:05:20.845 --> 00:05:23.500
Bringing information together in this way not

103
00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.880
only reduces the amount of effort needed to access

104
00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:31.090
information but also allows us to make the data more usable by cleaning or filtering it,

105
00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:33.830
automatically checking for any issues with the data,

106
00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:37.140
establishing known relationships among different types of data,

107
00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.750
and transforming the data in ways that make it more

108
00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.590
consumable and useful for downstream applications.

109
00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:45.170
Earlier, we said we wanted to examine the number

110
00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:47.890
and types of customers that cancel their wireless service.

111
00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:51.770
We identified the billing system as a source of the cancellation event information.

112
00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:55.280
We would expect that information to flow into our data warehouse,

113
00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.990
perhaps as part of a customer or subject area.

114
00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:00.890
But what about the types of customers that cancel?

115
00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:02.850
We might find the information around

116
00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:06.280
customer characteristics is from a different source system,

117
00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.465
like an external credit agency or consumer database.

118
00:06:09.465 --> 00:06:12.840
We would expect that information to be in our data warehouse as well.

119
00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.905
We'd like it to be linked somehow to our billing data,

120
00:06:15.905 --> 00:06:17.370
perhaps using a name,

121
00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:19.610
address or other customer identifier.

122
00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:22.145
With all the information we need in one place,

123
00:06:22.145 --> 00:06:24.945
it's much easier to assemble it for analysis.

124
00:06:24.945 --> 00:06:30.340
Okay. So now we have identified the real world phenomenon we're interested in, check.

125
00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:34.920
We figured out how that information gets captured by the source system, check.

126
00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:37.440
We have even made sure that all the information we need

127
00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.085
is in a common place we can get to it, check.

128
00:06:40.085 --> 00:06:44.920
So now, we're ready to start that analysis, right? Unfortunately, no.

129
00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.210
How do you actually get the data?

130
00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:50.660
Sure, it's sitting all nice and neat in the database but that doesn't do

131
00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:54.140
you a lot of good if you're using statistical software package,

132
00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:57.650
a standalone business intelligence tool or even Excel.

133
00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:01.340
More often than not, you need a manageable data set that you can feed

134
00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:05.595
into your analytical applications to actually accomplish the analysis.

135
00:07:05.595 --> 00:07:08.590
To get this data, you need some way of extracting

136
00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:10.420
just the information you need from

137
00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:13.895
the database and this is the fourth stage of our value chain.

138
00:07:13.895 --> 00:07:17.240
The ability to pull data directly is one of the skills that makes

139
00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:21.445
a good analyst a truly indispensable part of an analytical team.

140
00:07:21.445 --> 00:07:25.975
It's a crucial skill that's missing from a lot of analytical education programs.

141
00:07:25.975 --> 00:07:29.830
That's why we're dedicating an entire module to it in this course.

142
00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:33.130
We'll focus on something called the relational database and on

143
00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:36.965
a programming language called Structured Query language or SQL,

144
00:07:36.965 --> 00:07:39.180
which remains the dominant method of storing and

145
00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:42.130
extracting data in most industries and organizations.

146
00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:43.890
Certainly, there are other methods.

147
00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:46.230
You may hear terms like data virtualization,

148
00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:50.990
data federation or in-database analytics which offer alternatives to both the storage of

149
00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:53.560
structured information and relational databases

150
00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:56.800
or bypass the need to explicitly extract data from them.

151
00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:00.685
We'll actually spend a later video talking about these ideas at a high level.

152
00:08:00.685 --> 00:08:05.475
But the truth is that an awful lot of analysis done today uses relational database data.

153
00:08:05.475 --> 00:08:08.025
If you're going to be effective in today's marketplace,

154
00:08:08.025 --> 00:08:11.195
you need to be at least conversant in those technologies and methods.

155
00:08:11.195 --> 00:08:14.510
Now, revisiting our customer cancellation example,

156
00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:16.780
let's consider what exactly we need to get

157
00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:19.365
out of our data warehouse to feed our analysis.

158
00:08:19.365 --> 00:08:23.420
Again, we want to understand what types of people cancel service.

159
00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:26.770
So it might be reasonable to get data at the customer level.

160
00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:28.565
We'd also need to link up

161
00:08:28.565 --> 00:08:32.505
any characteristics of customers that we think might define their type.

162
00:08:32.505 --> 00:08:37.005
Of course, we need some indicator as to whether or not they cancel their service.

163
00:08:37.005 --> 00:08:39.840
If we also wanted to understand what makes customers who

164
00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:42.775
cancel different from customers who don't cancel,

165
00:08:42.775 --> 00:08:46.770
we want to pull the same data for customers that did not cancel as well.

166
00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:48.260
So at long last,

167
00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.515
we have the data we need to actually execute an analysis.

168
00:08:51.515 --> 00:08:53.315
As you'll learn in later courses,

169
00:08:53.315 --> 00:08:55.720
there are a wide selection of methods, techniques,

170
00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:57.620
and tools available to you to perform

171
00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:01.125
data analysis but they broadly fall into three categories;

172
00:09:01.125 --> 00:09:05.720
descriptive analytics, predictive analytics and prescriptive analytics.

173
00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:07.300
In our next video,

174
00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:10.135
we'll talk about these three different types of analysis.

175
00:09:10.135 --> 00:09:12.390
We'll discover that completing the analysis

176
00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:15.305
only begins the second half of our journey toward action.

177
00:09:15.305 --> 00:09:18.860
For now, let's recap what we've learned to this point.

178
00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:23.490
We realize that everything starts with events or characteristics in the real world.

179
00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:25.610
We talked about how those events need to be

180
00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:28.295
captured by source systems and turned into data.

181
00:09:28.295 --> 00:09:31.190
We learned how data from source systems can be brought

182
00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:34.450
together into one common location for access and storage.

183
00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:40.130
Finally we saw the need to be able to extract only the data we need for analysis.
