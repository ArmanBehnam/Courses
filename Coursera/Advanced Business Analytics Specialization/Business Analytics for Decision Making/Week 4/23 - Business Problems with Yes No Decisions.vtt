1
00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.830
Yes or no decisions are very
common in business problems.

2
00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:05.740
In prescriptive analytics, yes or

3
00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.920
no decisions are modeled
with binary variables.

4
00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.325
A binary variable takes on a value of 0 or
1.

5
00:00:13.325 --> 00:00:14.325
In this video,

6
00:00:14.325 --> 00:00:19.205
we discuss three business problems that
lead to binary optimization models.

7
00:00:19.205 --> 00:00:23.945
A company is considering using magazine
outlets for an advertising campaign.

8
00:00:23.945 --> 00:00:26.825
The company has identified
seven publishers.

9
00:00:26.825 --> 00:00:31.755
Each publisher breaks down the subscriber
base into a number of groups

10
00:00:31.755 --> 00:00:34.350
based on demographics and location.

11
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.180
The company has set a budget for
the advertising campaign and

12
00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.460
wants to maximize the number of
subscribers exposed to its ads.

13
00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.290
The company wants to determine
which publishers to select and

14
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.480
how many groups to purchase
from each publisher.

15
00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.380
Clearly, the selection of a publisher
requires a yes or no decision.

16
00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.630
That is,
a publisher is either selected or not.

17
00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.420
Once a publisher is selected,
a second decision

18
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.680
must be made regarding the number
of subscriber groups to purchase.

19
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.780
The model for this problem must take into
consideration that no subscriber groups

20
00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.980
can be purchased from a publisher
that has not been selected.

21
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.720
It also must consider that when
two publishers are competitors,

22
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.810
the company wants to select
amongst one of them.

23
00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.950
Finally, the model should take into
account that there is a fixed cost for

24
00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.640
engaging a publisher.

25
00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.450
This fixed cost is paid for
every publisher that the model selects.

26
00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.620
The binary decision variables can be
used to model all these constraints.

27
00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.970
Now, consider another situation.

28
00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.700
A company's establishing a new business

29
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.570
to serve customers in a region
around the Cincinnati, Ohio area.

30
00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.225
The company has identified
16 key market areas and

31
00:01:51.225 --> 00:01:54.680
wants to establish regional
offices to meet the goal

32
00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.580
of being to able to travel to all
key markets within 60 minutes.

33
00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.380
The company has gathered data on
travel times, in minutes, between each

34
00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.078
pair of cities and would like to create
a model to answer the following questions.

35
00:02:09.078 --> 00:02:12.740
What is the minimum number of
regional offices required to meet

36
00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:13.890
the companyâ€™s goal?

37
00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.880
Suppose that the company
changes the goal to 90 minutes.

38
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.150
So what will be the best solution?

39
00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.630
How many markets can be covered with
4 regional offices within a travel

40
00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.140
time of 60 minutes?

41
00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.440
The answers to these questions would
help the company establish an original

42
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.360
office network that balances service and
cost.

43
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.050
While being within 60 minutes of all
these customers may be desirable,

44
00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.582
the cost may be too high.

45
00:02:39.582 --> 00:02:46.470
A model for this problem would require yes
or no variables, one for each location.

46
00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.680
The value of these variables
will indicate whether or

47
00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.865
not to choose the location to
establish a regional office.

48
00:02:53.865 --> 00:02:57.170
Given a table of travel times,
it can be determined

49
00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.080
the set of cities covered by a location
that is selected for a regional office.

50
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.070
For example, if Cincinnati is selected,

51
00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.380
then this regional office
can reach in 60 minutes or

52
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.902
less those customers in Brookville,
Middletown, Hamilton, and Florence.

53
00:03:13.902 --> 00:03:18.400
A regional office in Middletown
would cover Dayton, Beavercreek,

54
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.310
Hamilton, Cincinnati, and Florence.

55
00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.920
A solution to this problem will likely
have a few cities that are covered by more

56
00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.140
than one regional office.

57
00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.410
Let's go through one more example.

58
00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.730
Forest planning models prescribe
which areas to harvest

59
00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.140
to identify demand in each
period over a planning horizon.

60
00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.160
Ideally, forest planning models

61
00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.160
would include environmental concerns
related to wildlife protection,

62
00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:52.040
erosion, water quality, and
preservation of scenic beauty.

63
00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.630
However, analysts have not found
a direct way of formulating these

64
00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:01.260
multiple concerns in models to
determine harvest patterns.

65
00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.060
Instead, proxy management
options have been established.

66
00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.870
The most common is
the so-called adjacency, or

67
00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.022
maximum opening harvesting constraint.

68
00:04:11.022 --> 00:04:15.240
These constraints establish
the maximum contiguous area

69
00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.430
that may be harvested
in a given time period.

70
00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.150
Neighboring areas can then be harvested

71
00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:26.260
only when the trees in the first
area have grown to a minimum size.

72
00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.330
The resulting patterns help
with wildlife protection.

73
00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:35.810
For example, elks will not feed
on openings created by harvesting

74
00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:40.540
unless they are relatively near
the protection provided by grown trees.

75
00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:45.990
Mandated maximum contiguous areas that
can be harvested are between 75 and

76
00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.590
125 acres,
depending on the country or region.

77
00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:56.910
Forest engineers configure harvesting
blocks within the maximum allowed area.

78
00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:03.250
Models that create visible harvesting
patterns require yes or no decisions

79
00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:08.300
to select the blocks to be harvested and
to impose the adjacency constraints.

80
00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:13.710
These three decision problems are a small
sample of the wide applicability

81
00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.790
of optimization models
with binary variables.

82
00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:21.970
The applications that we just discussed
come from three different areas,

83
00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.760
advertising, logistics, and forestry.

84
00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:30.010
There are many more in areas such as
network design in supply chain management,

85
00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:34.620
portfolio selection in finance,
and power generation in energy.

86
00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.717
In the next video, you will learn how
to build models with binary variables.
