1
00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.470
This is the last module of the third
course in our specialization.

2
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.690
You are going to learn two
things in this module.

3
00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:10.577
First, you are going to
learn the basics of how to

4
00:00:10.577 --> 00:00:13.545
model problems that require yes or
no decisions.

5
00:00:13.545 --> 00:00:18.261
These models use variables that
can only take on two values,

6
00:00:18.261 --> 00:00:22.061
zero or one,
they are called binary variables.

7
00:00:22.061 --> 00:00:26.474
There are many business problems that
can be modeled with binary variables.

8
00:00:26.474 --> 00:00:30.339
So it's important that you know
the fundamentals of this model.

9
00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:33.426
Second, you're going to
learn how predictive and

10
00:00:33.426 --> 00:00:37.026
prescriptive analytics can be
combined in a single model.

11
00:00:37.026 --> 00:00:41.199
This will illustrate how techniques
don't live in isolation,

12
00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:45.010
they can work together to
tackle complex problems.

13
00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.730
In fact, you can consider this a preview
of what we're going to ask you to do for

14
00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.700
the capstone project for
this specialization stage.

15
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.590
In module three you
learned that optimization

16
00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.660
can be used to find the best option
out of many possible alternatives.

17
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.980
Linear programming was a solution
technique behind the models

18
00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.290
that we formulated.

19
00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:06.600
Recall that for

20
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.620
linear programming to work all
the functions in the model must be linear.

21
00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.970
That is, the functions must be sums or

22
00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.140
differences of variables,
multiplied by constant values.

23
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.570
The variables in those models,

24
00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.040
are allowed to take fractional values,
in a range that we are free to specify.

25
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.790
The ones that we created,

26
00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.830
if you recall, we forced
the variables to be non-negative.

27
00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.030
Those variables are helpful to
model many type of decisions, but

28
00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.680
they're not helpful when the decisions
are about whether to do something or not.

29
00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.260
For example, if you want a model to
choose a set of suppliers, then you need

30
00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.970
variables that can tell you whether
a particular supplier is chosen or not.

31
00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.110
This will be the same as in the situation
where you would like to choose the type

32
00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.510
of digital ads to use in
an advertising campaign.

33
00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:06.240
Anything that has to do with choosing
an item or not requires binary variables.

34
00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.640
Models with binary variables are part
of what is called integer programming.

35
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.750
Solving integer programming problems
is exponentially more difficult

36
00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.970
than solving linear programming problems.

37
00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.380
This is why these problems are often
solved using heuristic optimization.

38
00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.390
When a Heuristic search ends,

39
00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.170
it can not guarantee that
the optimal solution has been found.

40
00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.830
However, these techniques normally
find optimal solutions, or

41
00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.720
they provide very good approximations.

42
00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.580
In general, they can find a solution
that is much better than what you and

43
00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.420
I could find by a manual process.

44
00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:49.330
We'll discuss some fundamental concepts of
Heuristics versus optimal procedures and

45
00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.730
we'll show some examples.

46
00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.570
The second part of this module is
really exciting because we will combine

47
00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.230
what you learn in module two and
module three.

48
00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.990
Remember that in module two,
you learn about Monte Carlo simulation,

49
00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:08.330
this technique allow you
to model uncertainty.

50
00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.470
We saw that adding uncertainty
into a model is important

51
00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.460
because expected values
tend to simplify things

52
00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:19.560
too much by ignoring the full
complexity of the problem.

53
00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.930
Well after we model uncertainty with
Monte Carlo simulation, we went back

54
00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:29.080
to using respective values to create
optimization models in module three.

55
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.510
In part we did this because I
wanted to introduce optimization

56
00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.040
without the complexity of
dealing with uncertainty.

57
00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.950
But now you know the fundamentals of both,
simulation and optimization.

58
00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.511
So it's time to combine them and
create models that use predictive and

59
00:03:46.511 --> 00:03:51.472
prescriptive tools to deal with
the reality of complex decision problems.
