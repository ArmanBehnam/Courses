00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.240
In this video we're going
to develop models for

2
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.670
one of the decision problems that
we described in the last video.

3
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.430
Recall that we discussed three decision
problems that require yes or no decisions.

4
00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:16.760
These decisions are modeled
with binary variables.

5
00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.610
For the first of the three problems,

6
00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:25.410
we will create a mathematical model before
developing Excel and Solver models.

7
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.210
This is an approach that I showed to
you in module three of this course.

8
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.970
Then we kind of forgot about it,
and went directly to Excel and

9
00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.760
all the other examples that
we have worked together.

10
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.750
So I want to go back to the idea of
creating the math model first, and

11
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.080
then translating it to Excel.

12
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.964
The problem consists of a company that
wants to select magazine publishers for

13
00:00:49.964 --> 00:00:52.130
an advertising campaign.

14
00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.800
The data that the company has
collected is shown in this table.

15
00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.260
The company also knows that it
costs $250 to engage a publisher.

16
00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.505
This is a fixed cost than needs to be
paid to each publisher that is selected.

17
00:01:07.505 --> 00:01:11.635
Also, the advertising budget
has been set at $25,000.

18
00:01:11.635 --> 00:01:16.899
Since the company is considering
seven publishers labeled A to G,

19
00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:20.955
the model will have
seven binary variables.

20
00:01:20.955 --> 00:01:25.230
We're going to use the publisher
labels for the binary variables.

21
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:30.690
In this way A = 1 will indicate
that Publisher A is selected,

22
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:36.742
B = 1 will indicate that
Publisher B is selected, and so on.

23
00:01:36.742 --> 00:01:39.930
The model also needs
seven interior variables

24
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.030
to choose the number of groups
to purchase from each publisher.

25
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.720
Let's go over those variables GA to GG.

26
00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.640
So GA will be the number of groups
purchased from Publisher A.

27
00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.820
We're now ready to formulate the problem.

28
00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.960
Let's just start with
the objective function.

29
00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.330
It is reasonable to think that
the company will like to maximize total

30
00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.970
exposure while not exceeding
its advertising budget.

31
00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.060
The total exposure is
the number of subscribers

32
00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.820
reached by the advertising campaign.

33
00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.530
The exposure from engaging
a publisher is the number of

34
00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.190
groups bought from the publisher
multiplied by the size of the group.

35
00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.658
The exposure from engaging publisher A,
for example,

36
00:02:22.658 --> 00:02:27.033
is 460 subscribers times GA,
the groups bought from publisher A.

37
00:02:27.033 --> 00:02:32.530
The total exposure is the sum of all
these products as shown in here.

38
00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.700
The model has ten constraints.

39
00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.550
The first seven constraints
restrict the purchasing of groups

40
00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.040
only from those publishers
that have been selected.

41
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.810
What this means in terms of
the decision variables is that if A =

42
00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.252
0 then GA must be = 0.

43
00:02:51.252 --> 00:02:57.940
However if A = 1 then GA can
take any value between 0 and 5.

44
00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.270
The reason for
the upper limit to B at 5 is

45
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:06.750
that this is the maximum number of groups
that can be bought from Publisher A.

46
00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.130
This is the set of seven constraints
that model this part of the problem.

47
00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.940
Note how the form of the constraint
enforces the logic that

48
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.760
the groups from a publisher can be bought
only when the publisher is selected.

49
00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.930
The next two constraints are related
to what we mentioned in the last video

50
00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.510
about publishers being competitors.

51
00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.910
We have B and D, in that situation,
and also C and G.

52
00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.330
We want constraints that will produce
solutions that do not include

53
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:43.240
the selection of both B and D or
the selection of both C and G.

54
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:48.005
There is a fairly simple way to create
a constraint to deal with this situation.

55
00:03:48.005 --> 00:03:52.985
If B and D are selected then
the sum of these variables is 2.

56
00:03:52.985 --> 00:03:58.479
Then, all we need to do is to restrict
this sum to be no more than 1.

57
00:03:58.479 --> 00:04:03.455
If B + D is forced to be less than or
equal to 1,

58
00:04:03.455 --> 00:04:06.190
then only one of them can be selected.

59
00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.030
We do the same for C and G, as shown here.

60
00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.210
Now we need to add the budget
constraints to complete the model.

61
00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:16.140
There are two sources of cost.

62
00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.900
The fixed cost of engaging a publisher,
and

63
00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.480
the variable cost of purchasing groups.

64
00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:27.600
A fixed cost of $250 is paid for
each publisher that is selected.

65
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.250
Therefore, these costs can be calculated

66
00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.440
as the sum of all the binary
variables multiplied by 250.

67
00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:40.130
The variable cost depends on the number
of groups bought from each publisher.

68
00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:43.420
Since there is a cost per group for
each publisher,

69
00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:48.930
then the variable cost is the product of
the number of groups and the group cost.

70
00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:53.010
The sum of all these products
is the total variable cost.

71
00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:56.370
The constraint is that
the sum of the fixed and

72
00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:01.410
the variable cost should be less than or
equal to $25,000.

73
00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.140
And this completes the model.

74
00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:07.210
Now locate and open the Excel
file Advertising Campaign so

75
00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:13.010
you can see how the mathematical model can
be translated into a spreadsheet model.

76
00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:15.310
The spreadsheet has four tables.

77
00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:20.590
The first small table contains
the fixed cost and the budget data.

78
00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:25.300
The table just below has the publisher
data with the number of groups.

79
00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.630
The subscriber per group,
the cost per group, and

80
00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:33.180
the block of decision variables
that are highlighted in light gold.

81
00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.020
There are two more tables
in the right side,

82
00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:39.590
one with the objective function and
one with the constraints.

83
00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:42.870
Let's clear all the values of
the decision variables, and

84
00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:44.124
enter the following solution.

85
00:05:44.124 --> 00:05:50.560
Choose A, B, E, and F.

86
00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:57.150
We buy 5 groups from A and B,
3 groups from E, and 1 group from F.

87
00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.620
We can verify that this solution
is feasible since it meets

88
00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:03.520
all the constraints.

89
00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:07.928
The total exposure of
the solution is 761,000.

90
00:06:07.928 --> 00:06:12.240
This spreadsheet contains
an optimization model for this problem.

91
00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:16.460
Let's take a look at it by clicking
on the ASP tab of the ribbon.

92
00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:23.550
The objective function is to maximize
$J$4, that is total exposure.

93
00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:29.710
The decision variables are in the block
from cell $E$9 to cell $F$15.

94
00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:35.230
All the constraints in this model
are of the less than or equal type.

95
00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:39.534
The left-hand sides are in
cells $I$9 to $I$18,

96
00:06:39.534 --> 00:06:44.370
the right-hand sides are in $K$9 to $K$18.

97
00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:50.770
Finally, the model forces the variables
in $E$9 to $E$15 to be binary,

98
00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:56.060
and the variables in $F$9
to $F$15 to be integer.

99
00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:00.310
Before solving, we verify that
the engine is set to the standard LP.

100
00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:03.710
Click the green play button to solve.

101
00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:10.770
The optimal solution engages publishers A,
B, E and G.

102
00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:14.880
It prescribes the purchase
13 groups which result

103
00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:19.619
in a total exposure of 876,200.

104
00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:24.360
I know that with practice and
intuition it is possible to

105
00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:28.780
create Excel models without ever
formulating the mathematical model.

106
00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:33.607
However, I wanted to show to you
a mathematical formulation of a binary

107
00:07:33.607 --> 00:07:37.395
problem, to give you a mental
picture of these models.

108
00:07:37.395 --> 00:07:42.219
This should help you keep in mind
the three elements of an optimization

109
00:07:42.219 --> 00:07:45.830
problem as you work on your Excel and
Solver models.
