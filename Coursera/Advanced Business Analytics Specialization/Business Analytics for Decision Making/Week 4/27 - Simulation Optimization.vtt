00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.410
Throughout this course you
have learned how to use data

2
00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:08.690
to create models that help you solve
a variety of problems in business.

3
00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:11.800
We started with models
to make predictions and

4
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.670
then moved to models that
prescribed solutions.

5
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.360
In the previous video, we introduced the
idea of merging two analytic technologies,

6
00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.440
simulation and optimization.

7
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.700
By setting chance constraints,
we were able to account for

8
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:30.460
the uncertainty in some key input
data to an optimization model.

9
00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.170
In this video,
we are going to build on that and

10
00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.670
describe how simulation and
optimization can be fully integrated.

11
00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.440
The process of developing
a simulation optimization model

12
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.550
is not very different from
what we have been doing.

13
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.130
It requires the definition of the three
main elements of an optimization model,

14
00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:55.170
that is the decision variables,
constraints, and the objective function.

15
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.410
In addition, we need to identify
the sources uncertainty

16
00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.090
that would be part of
the simulation model.

17
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.040
Let's consider the following situation.

18
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.137
An investor is considering 4
assets to invest a $100,000.

19
00:01:09.137 --> 00:01:13.056
The annual return of each asset is
the major source of uncertainty in

20
00:01:13.056 --> 00:01:14.700
the decision problem.

21
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.460
Through a statistical analysis of
historical data, the investors has found

22
00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:25.140
probability distribution functions to
model the annual return of each asset.

23
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.410
The functions and the limits on
the amounts that she feels comfortable

24
00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.570
investing in each assets
are shown in this statement.

25
00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.920
The annual return of bonds
is assumed to be a uniform

26
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.167
distribution between 4% and 6%.

27
00:01:40.167 --> 00:01:46.111
The returns of a stock follow a lognormal
distribution with mean of 11% and

28
00:01:46.111 --> 00:01:48.990
a standard deviation of 4%.

29
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.970
The returns of mutual funds is considered
to follow a normal distribution

30
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.300
with mean of 8% and
standard deviation of 1%.

31
00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.670
The money market is considered
to have a fixed return of 1%.

32
00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.962
In addition,
the investor must deal with other risks,

33
00:02:04.962 --> 00:02:09.385
such as changes in the economy or
major global events.

34
00:02:09.385 --> 00:02:14.680
One way to account for such uncertainty
is to consider your risk factors for

35
00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.460
each asset as shown in this table.

36
00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:24.230
Negative values represent low risk and
values greater than 1 represent high risk.

37
00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:30.130
The investor specifies a limit on
the total amount on risk per $1 invested.

38
00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.354
Let's assume that in
the case of our investor,

39
00:02:33.354 --> 00:02:36.830
she has set a risk
factor limit of 100,000.

40
00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:42.313
The problem is to find how to invest
the $100,000 in order to maximize total

41
00:02:42.313 --> 00:02:47.719
respective return by staying within the
investment limits set by the investor and

42
00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:51.270
by not exceeding the total risk factor.

43
00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.980
Locate and open the Excel
file Portfolio Optimization.

44
00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.060
The top table in the spreadsheet
contains the data for

45
00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.090
the four assets that
the investor is considering.

46
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.690
First we have the parameters of the
probability distribution functions, then

47
00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:11.560
there are the investment limits for each
asset, and then we have the risk factors.

48
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.020
The model is in the bottom table.

49
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.750
As usual, the light gold cells
indicate the decision variables.

50
00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.770
In this case the decisions are the amounts
to be invested in each asset.

51
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.610
The total in this column is
the sum of all the investments,

52
00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.510
which needs to be less than or
equal to $100,000.

53
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:37.342
The risk for each asset is the product of
the risk factor and the amount invested.

54
00:03:37.342 --> 00:03:41.210
The total risk must be less than or
equal to a 100,000.

55
00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:45.200
The return for the first three
assets is a random variable.

56
00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.630
As we have done in all our models,
these uncertain cells are shown in green.

57
00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:55.020
They contain the probability distribution
functions, a uniform distribution for

58
00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.860
bonds, a lognormal distribution for
stocks, and a normal distribution for

59
00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.210
mutual funds.

60
00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:05.330
The value column contains
the return value in dollars.

61
00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.715
The sum of this column is the total
return value that we're maximizing.

62
00:04:09.715 --> 00:04:11.385
We use light orange for

63
00:04:11.385 --> 00:04:16.535
the total value cell to indicate that this
is both the output of the simulation and

64
00:04:16.535 --> 00:04:20.465
also the objective function value for
the optimization.

65
00:04:20.465 --> 00:04:25.190
Click on the ASP tab to access
the Solver model panel.

66
00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:29.405
The optimization model
consists of maximizing E14,

67
00:04:29.405 --> 00:04:32.462
which is the total value of the returns.

68
00:04:32.462 --> 00:04:38.254
The decision variables are the investment
locations in B10 to B13.

69
00:04:38.254 --> 00:04:42.733
There are two constraints, one for
the total amount invested and one for

70
00:04:42.733 --> 00:04:44.360
the total risk.

71
00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:49.303
In this simulation model,
we have the uncertainty variables

72
00:04:49.303 --> 00:04:53.105
of the annual returns
in cells D10 to D12 and

73
00:04:53.105 --> 00:04:57.019
we have the uncertainty
output function E14.

74
00:04:57.019 --> 00:05:01.222
This is the solution that ASP found for
this problem.

75
00:05:01.222 --> 00:05:05.920
This visible solution meets all
the criteria specified by the investor.

76
00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.810
The value in E14 is not expected return,
it is

77
00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:16.160
just one trial of the simulation using
the values of the decision variables.

78
00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:22.619
To find out more about the performance
of this portfolio, double click on E14.

79
00:05:22.619 --> 00:05:29.768
The expected return of this
portfolio is estimated to be $6352.

80
00:05:29.768 --> 00:05:34.603
The frequency of this tuition can be
used to estimate probabilities that

81
00:05:34.603 --> 00:05:38.190
the portfolio achieves some
desired return levels.

82
00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:43.170
For example,
the simulation predicts that there is

83
00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:48.220
a 9.96% probability that
the return will be $8,000 or more.

84
00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:53.220
Simulation optimization is one of the most
sophisticated tools in data analytics for

85
00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:54.320
business.

86
00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:58.790
It allows you to create models that
include many of the complexities

87
00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:00.850
of business decisions.

88
00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:05.280
In many ways, these models can be
considered to be at the highest level

89
00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.550
of the analytical process.

90
00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:12.880
With this, we conclude our course on
data analytics for decision making.

91
00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:17.424
I hope that this course has given
you insights in how to use data to

92
00:06:17.424 --> 00:06:21.982
create models that can help
businesses make better decisions.
