00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.935
As we saw in the introduction,
the three in an optimization model

2
00:00:04.935 --> 00:00:10.514
are the decision variables, the objective
function, and the constraints.

3
00:00:10.514 --> 00:00:14.718
The key to the application of
optimization is to be able to formulate

4
00:00:14.718 --> 00:00:18.718
the problem as a mathematical model,
this requires practice.

5
00:00:18.718 --> 00:00:21.588
So in this video,
we will follow a systematic

6
00:00:21.588 --> 00:00:26.620
process to translate a decision
problem in to a mathematical model.

7
00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:29.440
We will focus on
the transportation problem

8
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.910
that we describe in
the introduction of this module.

9
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.545
In the transportation problem, we want
to find the best way of moving units of

10
00:00:37.545 --> 00:00:41.320
product from one set of
suppliers to a set of customers.

11
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.560
The suppliers have limited capacity
to meet the customer's demands.

12
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.000
There is a cost associated with moving
one unit of product from a supplier

13
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.150
to a customer.

14
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.040
So, in terms of data there are three
sets of values, capacity, demand, and

15
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.030
transportation costs.

16
00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.230
The first step is to identify
the decision variables.

17
00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.020
In this problem there is only
one set of decision variables,

18
00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.810
the quantity to be shipped from
each supplier to each customer.

19
00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.940
Since there are five suppliers and
four customers,

20
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.180
there are four times five, or
20 decision variables in this problem.

21
00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.445
We then need to give each
variable a unique name.

22
00:01:22.445 --> 00:01:28.710
See the suppliers are labeled A to E and
the customers are labeled 1 to 4,

23
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.980
we can create a name this is
a combination of these two labels.

24
00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:37.130
In this way, A1, A2, A3, and

25
00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:44.480
A4 represent the quantities shipped from
supplier A to customers 1, 2, 3, and 4.

26
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:45.610
The same is done for

27
00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.940
the other suppliers, resulting in 20
unique names shown in this table.

28
00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.310
The second step is to
formulate the constraints,

29
00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.450
this problem has two
main sets of constraints.

30
00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.600
One set of constraints to limit the total
amount shipped from each supplier and

31
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.230
another set of constraints to make sure
that the solution satisfies the demand.

32
00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:12.410
Constraints are formulated as
functions of the decision variables.

33
00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.865
In this course we are going
to focus on linear functions.

34
00:02:15.865 --> 00:02:21.620
This means that constraints will be the
sums of all differences of variables or

35
00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.560
sums of differences of variables
multiplied by constants.

36
00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.280
Let's formulate the capacity constraints.

37
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.000
Since we want to limit the amount of
units shipped from each supplier,

38
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.921
we calculate the total units
shipped from each supplier.

39
00:02:36.921 --> 00:02:43.099
The total quantities sent by Supplier A is
the sum of all the quantities

40
00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:48.140
sent from this location,
that is A1+A2+A3+A4.

41
00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.871
Since this amount should not exceed
the capacity of the supplier,

42
00:02:51.871 --> 00:02:56.134
then the constraint is that the sum of
the shipments from Supplier A should be

43
00:02:56.134 --> 00:02:57.680
less than or equal to 60.

44
00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:03.390
The capacity constraints for the other
suppliers are formulated in a similar way.

45
00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.320
Now, let's formulate
the demand constraints.

46
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.906
The total quantity that each customers
receives is the sum of the units

47
00:03:09.906 --> 00:03:11.626
shipped from a supplier.

48
00:03:11.626 --> 00:03:14.944
For example, the total number of units
received by customer is the sum of A1 + B1

49
00:03:14.944 --> 00:03:15.775
+ C1 + D1 + E1.

50
00:03:15.775 --> 00:03:20.620
This is the sum of the shipments to

51
00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:26.340
customer 1 from all suppliers.

52
00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:32.810
In order to satisfy customer A demand this
sum should be greater than or equal to 75.

53
00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.090
The same logic applies to
the other three customers

54
00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.760
to formulate their demand constraints.

55
00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.240
There is one more thing
that must be added that is

56
00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.180
very common in these type
of mathematical models.

57
00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.530
In most problems,
the only meaningful value for

58
00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.170
the decision variables are positive.

59
00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.650
In other words, negative values for the
decision variables often have no meaning.

60
00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.260
If you think about it, in all formulation
of the transportation problem,

61
00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.940
negative values for
the decision variables have no meaning.

62
00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.630
The only possible interpretation
of a negative shipment would be

63
00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.810
product that is returned to the supplier.

64
00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.370
However, the model is not set
up to handle this situation.

65
00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.250
This means that we need to add bounds for

66
00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.770
the decision variables to
force it to be positive.

67
00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.460
So we simply say that all the variables
in the model are non-negative.

68
00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.590
In these bounds are known as
non-negativity constraints.

69
00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.400
The third and final step consists of
formulating the objective function.

70
00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:42.970
This is the mathematical expression that
evaluates the quality of the solution.

71
00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.480
In optimization we want to find
the best solution to our problem.

72
00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.844
Where best means that the solution
achieves the maximum or

73
00:04:50.844 --> 00:04:54.350
the minimum value of
the objective function.

74
00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:59.330
For the transportation problem,
best means a solution that minimizes

75
00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:03.930
the total cost of supplying the product
needed to satisfy all the demand.

76
00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:08.720
The objective,
like the constraints is formulated

77
00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.750
as a mathematical function
of the decision variables.

78
00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:15.690
We're going to focus on
linear objective functions.

79
00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:19.150
We have a table of costs,
in which each entry

80
00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:24.610
represents the cost of sending a unit of
product from a supplier to a customer.

81
00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:28.920
We also have decision variables that
represent the number of units shipped from

82
00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.010
each supplier to each customer.

83
00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:33.730
Then, the objective function is the sum

84
00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:38.590
of the product of each cost times
its corresponding decision variable.

85
00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:44.205
For example, the cost of shipping a unit
of product from supplier A to customer 1,

86
00:05:44.205 --> 00:05:45.300
is 3.

87
00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:49.800
Since the decisions variable A1 represents
all the units that are going to be sent

88
00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:54.690
from supplier A to customer 1,
then the cost of the quantity

89
00:05:54.690 --> 00:06:00.090
sent from supplier A to
customer 1 is 3 times A1.

90
00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:04.020
All the other costs are calculated
in that similar way.

91
00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.650
The total cost is the sum
of all these products.

92
00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:10.300
The total cost function is linear

93
00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:14.025
because it is the sum of variables that
are multiplied by constant values.

94
00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.250
We have seen how to formulate
an optimization problem

95
00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:22.280
as a mathematical model
using linear functions.

96
00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:25.919
This type of formulation is known
as a linear programming model.

97
00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:31.780
Specialized algorithms have been
developed to solve this type of problems.

98
00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:34.580
We're not going to discuss
these algorithms here,

99
00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:36.060
we are just going to use them.

100
00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.780
But what is important to
keep in mind is that these

101
00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:44.079
algorithms are capable of solving
very large linear programming models.

102
00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:50.020
By that I mean models with many decision
variables and many constraints.

103
00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:53.620
This is why, whenever possible,
analysts use

104
00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:58.180
only linear functions to formulate the
constraints and the objective function.

105
00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:01.490
I just want to mention one
more thing before we go.

106
00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:04.150
In our example we have bounds for

107
00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:08.500
the decision variables and
two types of general constraints.

108
00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:12.230
A set of less than or
equal constraints to model capacity and

109
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:15.450
a set of greater than or
equal constraints to model demand.

110
00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:20.390
It is also possible to use equality
constraints in these models.

111
00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:24.250
So remember, you can use linear
functions to formulate constraints and

112
00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:25.520
the objective.

113
00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:30.190
And if you can represent all restrictions
of the problem with equality or

114
00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:33.940
inequality constraints, then you
have linear programming model, for

115
00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:36.730
which they are very
efficient solution methods.
