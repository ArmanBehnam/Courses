1
00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.970
What-If analysis is very
important in analytics.

2
00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:05.770
It is particularly relevant for

3
00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:09.150
models that do not capture
all sources of uncertainty.

4
00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:15.500
In our transportation problem for example,
we had considered that we know the demand

5
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:21.190
with certainty, or the demand is not going
to deviate much from the estimated values.

6
00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:25.690
In reality, demand could be deviate
from average historical values.

7
00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:30.740
In fact, even constant capacity
values may also be uncertain.

8
00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.670
If the model does not consider
uncertainty, then what-if analysis can be

9
00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.830
used to observe the effect of
changes in these input values.

10
00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.400
One simple way of doing what-if
analysis is to change a value, and

11
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.420
then resolve the problem to
observe changes in the solution.

12
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.380
For example, let's suppose that it is
possible to increase the supply capacity

13
00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:58.580
by ten units in any of the five
suppliers in our transportation example.

14
00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.520
Where would we put these extra ten units?

15
00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.070
Well, it seems reasonable to put them
in a place that will result in lowering

16
00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.780
the total transportation cost the most.

17
00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.310
If we don't have any other information,

18
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.110
we could just add ten units to
the capacity of all suppliers.

19
00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.130
Resolve the problem, and
observe the change in the shipments and

20
00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.090
the total cost.

21
00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.670
This is fairly simple to do in
a small problem like ours, but

22
00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.200
there is an easier way that
is scalable to large models.

23
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.119
Let's take a look at it.

24
00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:37.050
Locate and open the Excel file titled
Transportation Problem-Optimization.

25
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.260
This file has the optimization model
that we built in the last video.

26
00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:47.471
If you click on the ASP tab,
the silver options panel is displayed.

27
00:01:47.471 --> 00:01:50.480
We can verify that the model is there.

28
00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.590
Click on the play button
to rerun the software.

29
00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.110
Now click on the reports tool in
the analysis group or the ASP tab, and

30
00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.640
choose sensitivity within
the optimizations report.

31
00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.050
A sensitivity report one tab
is added to the workbook.

32
00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.160
This is the same as
the sensitivity report tab

33
00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.050
that I already included in the workbook,
but

34
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.670
in which I have changed the names of
the cells to identify them better.

35
00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.720
So let's use a sensitivity
report that I created.

36
00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.810
The first table includes information
about the decision variables.

37
00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.850
The second table includes
information about the constraints.

38
00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.230
Scroll down to the information
about the capacity constraints.

39
00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.420
The final value corresponds to the total
that is shipped from each supplier.

40
00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:46.020
For example, cell G16 has a value of 60,
indicating that in the optimal solution,

41
00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.260
60 units are shipped from
supplier A to O customers.

42
00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.790
The table also shows the right
hand side of the constraints.

43
00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.060
The right hand sides for

44
00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.160
the capacity constraints indicate the
supply limits and the right hand sides for

45
00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.850
the demand constraints indicate
the quantities required by each customer.

46
00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.170
The shadow prices are the key
information in this table.

47
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.420
A shadow price is the change
in the objective function for

48
00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.680
a unit of increase in the right
hand side of the constraints.

49
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.014
Since we're minimizing costs,
a negative shadow price means savings.

50
00:03:22.014 --> 00:03:27.182
Therefore, the shadow price of -4 for
supplier A, means that if we increase

51
00:03:27.182 --> 00:03:32.552
the capacity of this supplier by one unit,
the total cost will decrease by $4.

52
00:03:32.552 --> 00:03:35.860
We can see that we don't save

53
00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.640
any money by increasing
the capacity of suppliers B and C.

54
00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:41.890
This makes sense,

55
00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.640
because in the optimal solution,
these suppliers have extra capacity.

56
00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.700
The savings for increasing the capacity
of suppliers D and E are $2.

57
00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:56.973
Now the question is, can we keep saving
money if we keep increasing capacity?

58
00:03:56.973 --> 00:04:00.965
In other words,
are these saving unlimited?

59
00:04:00.965 --> 00:04:02.395
The answer is no.

60
00:04:02.395 --> 00:04:05.912
The last two columns of the table
tells us the operational

61
00:04:05.912 --> 00:04:07.833
range of these shadow prices.

62
00:04:07.833 --> 00:04:10.405
For example, for supplier A,

63
00:04:10.405 --> 00:04:15.430
we can increase capacity by 20 units and
save $4 per unit.

64
00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.200
After 20 units,
we simply don't know what will happen,

65
00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.370
the report is not able to
give us this information.

66
00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.880
If we increase the capacity of
supplier A by more than 20 units,

67
00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.820
we need to resolve the problem
to see what happens.

68
00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.298
If we decrease capacity,

69
00:04:32.298 --> 00:04:35.735
the cost will increase at the rate
given by the shadow price.

70
00:04:35.735 --> 00:04:42.000
That is, if we reduce capacity by one
unit, then the cost will increase by $4.

71
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.240
This is true for
reductions of up to 15 units.

72
00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.400
So to answer our original question
using the sensitivity report,

73
00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.750
we examine all the shadow prices for
the suppliers, and

74
00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.200
we find the one with
the most negative value.

75
00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:01.110
This is Supplier A,
which has a shadow price of -4.

76
00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:06.010
This is where we should add
the ten units of capacity,

77
00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:10.180
and reduce the total cost from 890 to 850.

78
00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.846
Let's make the change and
resolve the model to verify

79
00:05:13.846 --> 00:05:18.256
that our interpretation of
the sensitivity report is correct.

80
00:05:18.256 --> 00:05:24.605
Go to cell G6 in the model, and
change the value from 60 to 70.

81
00:05:24.605 --> 00:05:26.010
Click on the play button.

82
00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:32.310
As predicted by the sensitivity report,
the cost went down by $40 to 850.

83
00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:38.160
The one thing that you must keep in
mind about the sensitivity report,

84
00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:43.940
is that the information that it gives you
is only valid for one change at a time.

85
00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.390
That is, the shadow price of -4 for

86
00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:53.230
supplier A is only valid if all the other
data in the model remains unchanged.

87
00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:57.720
Let's restore the capacity for
Supplier A to 60, and go back to

88
00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:02.580
the sensitivity report to interpret the
shadow prices for the main constraints.

89
00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:07.430
Know that all the shadow prices for
the demand constraints are positive.

90
00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:12.840
These values are the cost of sending
additional units to these customers if all

91
00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:19.180
other data remains unchanged, that is, if
the capacities and the cost don't change.

92
00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:23.780
For example, if customer four
wants one more unit of product,

93
00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:27.220
the transportation costs for
that unit will be $8.

94
00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:32.130
This is very valuable information
because without resolving the problem,

95
00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:36.220
we can tell the increase in the costs
to the additional units of demand.

96
00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:41.990
Here again, these values are only true
within the ranges specified in the table.

97
00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:46.170
For customer four, this means that
the shadow price is valued for

98
00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:51.160
an increase of up to 15 more units or
for a decrease of 20 units.

99
00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:55.460
Let's change the demand
in F11 from 65 to 75, and

100
00:06:55.460 --> 00:07:00.120
verify that the cost will increase by $80,
to $907.

101
00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:06.810
As predicted, the cost did change to $970,
change the demand back to 65.

102
00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:11.460
Now let's take a look at one more
thing in the sensitivity report.

103
00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:15.020
There is a reduced cost for
each decision variable.

104
00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:19.750
This value is the amount by which
the original cost needs to be reduced in

105
00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:24.680
order for the solution to include
a shipment in that particular cell.

106
00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:30.150
For the cells that are already shipping
products, the reduced cost is zero.

107
00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:31.092
This makes sense,

108
00:07:31.092 --> 00:07:35.109
the cost doesn't need to be reduced
since the cell is already being used.

109
00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:38.900
Let's take C4 as an example.

110
00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:42.840
The current cost is $9, and
the reduced cost is $1.

111
00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:48.260
So, the reduced cost is saying
that we need to reduce the cost

112
00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:53.580
of $9 by more than $1 for C4 to be used.

113
00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:59.010
Remember that C4 represents shipments
from supplier C to customer four.

114
00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:00.730
Let's try this change.

115
00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:04.040
If we go from nine to eight,
nothing is going to change.

116
00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:08.390
The reduction needs to be of
more than the reduced cost.

117
00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:12.340
So we can enter 7.9 in cell F8 and
resolve.

118
00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:19.082
The new solution includes
a shipment of 20 units from C to 4.

119
00:08:19.082 --> 00:08:23.290
The allowable increase and
decrease values for the decision variables

120
00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:27.700
give us an indication of how precise
the cost estimates need to be.

121
00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:30.320
If a cost has a very wide range,

122
00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:34.450
then we know that we don't
need a very precise estimate.

123
00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:39.390
Because modest changes in this value
will not change the ultimate solution.

124
00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:44.220
The sensitivity report provides very
useful information for pricing decisions.

125
00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:48.180
The value of resources and
the robustness of the optimal solution.

126
00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:53.030
For complex what if questions involving
multiple changes in the model,

127
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:57.910
there might not be any other option
than making the changes in the model and

128
00:08:57.910 --> 00:08:59.350
resolving the model.

129
00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:02.605
However, for
direct questions about single items,

130
00:09:02.605 --> 00:09:06.507
such as the demand of a customer,
or the capacity of a supplier,

131
00:09:06.507 --> 00:09:10.651
the sensitivity report is all you
need to answer what if questions.
