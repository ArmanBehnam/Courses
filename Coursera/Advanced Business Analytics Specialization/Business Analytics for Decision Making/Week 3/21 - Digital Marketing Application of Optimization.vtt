00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.930
To conclude this module,

2
00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:07.190
we're going to use optimization to come up
with an optimal Digital Advertising Plan.

3
00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:12.350
The digital marketing industry is
very large and continues to grow.

4
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.080
This is directly related to
the growth in the number of

5
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.250
Internet users around the world.

6
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.260
The growth has been tremendous in both
developed, and developing countries.

7
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.170
Companies that want to have
a presence in the internet,

8
00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.880
have a variety of goals, but
they also have some restrictions.

9
00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.450
For example,
they have limited advertising budgets.

10
00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.490
Therefore, it is really important for

11
00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:41.620
them, to find the most effective way
of spending their advertising funds.

12
00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.550
For the purpose of this example, we're
going to consider that there are many

13
00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.770
types of digital advertising,
email marketing, search engine marketing,

14
00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.790
display ads, remarketing, YouTube ads,

15
00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:00.180
Gmail ads, social media ads,
and mobile ads to name a few.

16
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.330
Let's consider a company that wants to
increase revenue by increasing its brand

17
00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:05.490
awareness.

18
00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:10.790
The company wants to create
an advertising plan with search ads,

19
00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.420
display ads, Gmail ads, and YouTube ads.

20
00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.450
The company has collected
one year of conversion data.

21
00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.190
In digital advertising, conversions

22
00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:26.420
are defined as customer actions
that the company consider valuable.

23
00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:32.640
Conversions may be purchases, sign-ups,
calls initiated directly from an ad,

24
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.710
calls to a phone number on the ad,
or downloads.

25
00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.930
Tracking conversions is more
informative than tracking clicks.

26
00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:46.500
Because a click only tells us that
a potential customer went to the website,

27
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.580
but it doesn't tell us whether
the customer performed a valuable action.

28
00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.250
The company would like an advertising
plan that can be executed within

29
00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.920
a budget limit.

30
00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.130
The plan should a series
of policy requirements

31
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.350
that the company would like to impose.

32
00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.070
This is what the company would
like to see in a feasible plan.

33
00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.404
Total amount spent in digital
ads should not exceed $5,000.

34
00:02:11.404 --> 00:02:16.030
A minimum of $1,000 should
be spent in display ads.

35
00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.495
A minimum of $200 should
be spent in YouTube ads.

36
00:02:19.495 --> 00:02:25.040
At least 60% of the budget should
be spent in display and search ads.

37
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.990
What is spent in YouTube ads should not
be more than what's spent in Gmail ads.

38
00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.890
Gmail ads should not be more
than 10% of the budget.

39
00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.694
And finally, the plan should generate
at least 1,500 conversations.

40
00:02:39.694 --> 00:02:44.020
Let's take a look at how we can
create an optimization model

41
00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.680
with the available data.

42
00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.500
Locate and open the Excel file,
Digital Advertising.xlsx.

43
00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:56.350
The input data that we have is
from a 2015 advertising campaign.

44
00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:01.340
For each Ad type we have how much
the company pay for the Ads and

45
00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.380
the total number of conversions.

46
00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.200
The daily conversions are in
the conversion data tab.

47
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.370
The conversions are the sum
of each column.

48
00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.820
The conversions divided by cost is
an estimate of the number of conversions

49
00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.010
that each dollar spent in
an ad is able to generate.

50
00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:23.020
For example, according to the data
we have that on average 0.34 of

51
00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:28.230
our conversion is generated by
each dollar spent in search ads.

52
00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.460
We also have revenue data for

53
00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:34.910
each ad type, which we use to
calculate the return on investment.

54
00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:41.840
ROI is calculated as revenue
minus cost divided by cost.

55
00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.950
The decision variables in this
model are the Budget Allocations

56
00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.770
to the four different Ad types.

57
00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:53.000
Enter some arbitrary values to
check that the model works.

58
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.413
For example, enter 2,000, 2,000, 500 and

59
00:03:58.413 --> 00:04:03.660
500 for Search, Display,
YouTube and Gmail.

60
00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.500
The objective function is
the Total Net Revenue.

61
00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.290
This is calculated with
the sum product function.

62
00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:15.210
Since multiplying ROI by the budget
allocations results in revenue minus cost.

63
00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:17.632
The model has seven constraints,

64
00:04:17.632 --> 00:04:22.700
total add expenses is the sum
of all the budget allocations.

65
00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.557
This has to be less than or
equal to $5,000.

66
00:04:26.557 --> 00:04:31.418
To enforce the constraint that at least
60% of the budget much be spent in

67
00:04:31.418 --> 00:04:33.510
display and search ads.

68
00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:38.837
In cell I24 we add what we spend
in display and center ads and

69
00:04:38.837 --> 00:04:43.678
in cell K24,
we calculate 60% of the budget.

70
00:04:43.678 --> 00:04:48.990
The next constraint enforces that
one is spent in YouTube ads,

71
00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.650
does not exceed what
is spent in Gmail ads.

72
00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:59.230
The next constraint limits what
we can spend in Gmail ads,

73
00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:02.040
this should be less
than 10% of the budget.

74
00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:07.750
Cell calculates 10% of the budget,
which results in $500.

75
00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.710
Finally, we need to make
sure that the number of

76
00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:15.604
conversions that the plan is estimated
to generate, is at least 1,500.

77
00:05:15.604 --> 00:05:20.486
You can see that these can be calculated
with the sum product of the budget

78
00:05:20.486 --> 00:05:24.180
allocations and the conversions per cost.

79
00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:29.390
Click on the ASP tab, the model
pane shows the optimization model.

80
00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:32.542
The objective is to maximize F-15.

81
00:05:32.542 --> 00:05:37.280
The decision variables are C-16 to C-19.

82
00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.870
And the constraints are shown
on the normal constrains folder.

83
00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:46.732
The mole includes non negativity
bounds for the variables.

84
00:05:46.732 --> 00:05:51.010
The arbitrary solutions that
we entered is infant visible.

85
00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:55.480
You can verify this by checking that
all the constrains are satisfied.

86
00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:00.315
The estimated net revenue
is a little over $111,000.

87
00:06:00.315 --> 00:06:06.580
To find the best plan, all you need
to do is click on the Solve button.

88
00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:11.140
First, however, check that
the LP Standard Solver is selected.

89
00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:14.740
Click on the Engine tab of the Model pane.

90
00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:19.990
If the Standard LP Engine is not selected
you can choose it from the dropdown menu.

91
00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:22.410
Now, click on the Solve button.

92
00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:28.646
The optimization model prescribes a budget
allocation of $3,000 on such ads,

93
00:06:28.646 --> 00:06:34.780
$1,000 on display ads, and
$500 each on YouTube and Gmail ads.

94
00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:40.810
And this solution is feasible and also
optimal according to the company policies.

95
00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:44.420
Now, click on the sensitivity
report tab to figure out

96
00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:46.980
the effect of some of these policies.

97
00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:50.450
Let's interpret some of the shadow
prices that are not zero.

98
00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:53.860
The model estimates that ever
additional dollar of advertising

99
00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:56.650
generates $22.00 of net revenue.

100
00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:00.920
This estimate is based on
the ROI values in the model, and

101
00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:04.480
it doesn't consider other
factors that effect sales.

102
00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:09.930
The model imposes a minimum of
$1,000 to spent in display ads.

103
00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:13.890
This constraint has
a shadow price of minus $1.

104
00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:19.130
These value indicates that net
revenue will decrease by $1 for

105
00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:23.460
each additional dollar that we
insist on spending in display ads.

106
00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:30.540
The opposite is true, for the $4 shadow
price related to the limit on Gmail ads.

107
00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:34.380
That is net revenue
would increase by $4 for

108
00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:40.240
every additional dollar that we allow
the mail to allocate to Gmail ads.

109
00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:45.560
The purpose of this video was to show you
an additional application of optimization

110
00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:49.700
in an area that is no logistics or
transportation, I didn't want you to

111
00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:54.880
think that this prescribed analytics too,
is limited to operations problems.

112
00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:58.000
The modeling part requires
of their practice.

113
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.550
So I encourage you to think of problems
that you can formulate as optimization

114
00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:03.113
models.

115
00:08:03.113 --> 00:08:06.170
Go through the steps of
choosing the decision levels,

116
00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:10.270
building the objective functions,
and enforcing constraints.

117
00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:12.990
The more you do it, the easier it gets.

118
00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:17.620
This concludes our module on models for
decision making.

119
00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:22.265
We will build on this material in our
next and final module of our course.
