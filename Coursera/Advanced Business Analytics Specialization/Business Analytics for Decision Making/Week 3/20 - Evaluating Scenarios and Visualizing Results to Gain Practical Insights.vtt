00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.000
As we saw in the previous video,

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.320
the sensitivity report is a very
valuable tool for what-if analysis.

3
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:10.520
We also saw that it has
two main limitations.

4
00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:15.100
First, the report can only tell you what
will happen to the optimal solution,

5
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:20.520
when you make one change at a time and
everything else remains the same.

6
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.460
For example, we saw that the shadow price
of a capacity constraint can tell you

7
00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.610
the reduction in total cost for
every unit of additional capacity.

8
00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:32.270
That's great but

9
00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:38.600
it assumes that all other capacities are
going to stay at the same current values.

10
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.610
So, if we would like to know
the effect on the total costs,

11
00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.355
when we change two capacity
limits at the same time,

12
00:00:45.355 --> 00:00:49.420
we'll have to make the change
in the model and resolve.

13
00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.340
The other limitation
is that the prices and

14
00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.400
costs in the sensitivity report
are only valid in a specified range.

15
00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.557
For example, this sensitivity report
is the one that we generated in our

16
00:01:01.557 --> 00:01:04.700
last video for our transportation problem.

17
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:11.260
Cell $G$16 refers to the total amount
shipped from Supplier A to all customers.

18
00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.720
You can see that the total amount is 60,

19
00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.270
and that the capacity of
Supplier A is also 60.

20
00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.609
The capacity is given by the right
hand side of the constraint.

21
00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:25.369
The shadow price is -4,
and indicates that for

22
00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:30.884
every unit of additional capacity,
the total cost decr eases by $4.

23
00:01:30.884 --> 00:01:35.865
If this is all you are interested in
evaluating in your what-if analysis,

24
00:01:35.865 --> 00:01:40.843
then the only thing that you need to
remember is that this price is only valid

25
00:01:40.843 --> 00:01:43.230
within 20 units of increase.

26
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:46.722
This is given in the Allowable Increase
column of the table.

27
00:01:46.722 --> 00:01:50.540
What you're going to learn
in this video is how to

28
00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.340
evaluate the scenarios that involve
more than a single change, or

29
00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.970
where the change is outside the valid
range of the sensitivity report.

30
00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.480
You will also learn how to use Excel
charts to visualize sensitivity results.

31
00:02:05.555 --> 00:02:10.045
We will continue to use a transportation
problem to illustrate these concepts.

32
00:02:10.045 --> 00:02:14.935
Let's assume that there is uncertainty
in the demand of customer 4, and that we

33
00:02:14.935 --> 00:02:20.565
would like to see how the optimal solution
changes with changes in this demand.

34
00:02:20.565 --> 00:02:21.225
Locate and

35
00:02:21.225 --> 00:02:26.990
open the Excel file Transportation
Problem- Parameter Analysis.

36
00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.660
This file contains the transportation
model that we have been discussing

37
00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:31.310
in this module.

38
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.330
Note that the demand for
customer 4 is now 40 instead of 65.

39
00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.950
This is because we have added
the ASP function PsiOptParam.

40
00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.967
This function tells the software that
we will like to solve the problem for

41
00:02:47.967 --> 00:02:52.057
values of this demand
that vary from 40 to 90.

42
00:02:52.057 --> 00:02:56.338
If we go to the Analysis group of
the ASP tab and click on Reports,

43
00:02:56.338 --> 00:03:01.570
we'll find Parameter Analysis
on their Optimization reports.

44
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.060
These dialog allows us to identify
the variables and the objective function

45
00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.530
that we want in our report, and
also the parameters that we want to vary.

46
00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.230
Since we want to analyze the changes
in all the variables and

47
00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.900
the total cost, click on the double arrow.

48
00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.359
Also click on the double arrow for
the Parameters,

49
00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:26.999
leave the rest unchanged,
including the 11 major access points.

50
00:03:26.999 --> 00:03:31.765
By clicking OK, ASP generates
the analysis report one time.

51
00:03:31.765 --> 00:03:35.313
This is the same table that is in
the analysis report worksheet,

52
00:03:35.313 --> 00:03:36.920
included in the file.

53
00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.170
Which I have already formatted,
and I have included for

54
00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.640
those of you without access to ASP.

55
00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:49.316
The table shows 11 solutions to
the problem, 1 solution per demand value.

56
00:03:49.316 --> 00:03:51.230
The demand varies from 40 to 90,

57
00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.820
and as expected the cost
increases with the demand.

58
00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.530
The most important insight
from this analysis is that,

59
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.040
some suppliers ship the same
amount to the same customers

60
00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.770
regardless of the changes in
the demand of customer 4.

61
00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:13.520
For example supplier D, ships four units
to customer 1 in all the scenarios.

62
00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.750
Also supplier E only ships to customer 4.

63
00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.310
Shipments from supplier B
are also pretty stable.

64
00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.640
Suppliers A and C experience the most
changes, when the demand for

65
00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.560
customer 4 varies.

66
00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.650
It is possible to create more complicated
scenarios using the parameter analysis

67
00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.760
tool, by adding more parameters
that can change values.

68
00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.360
However, we're not going to
cover that in this course.

69
00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.199
We have seen that the interpretation
of the solver reports requires some

70
00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:48.790
technical knowledge of
optimization terminology.

71
00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:53.100
You have learned how to interpret shadow
prices and reduce costs, but you can't

72
00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:58.770
expect clients or other people in your
organization to know these concepts.

73
00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.870
Data visualization can help present
results in forms that are more

74
00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.712
understandable to those not
familiar with optimization.

75
00:05:06.712 --> 00:05:08.540
Let's start with shipments.

76
00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:11.300
Instead of showing the results in a table,

77
00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.380
you can create a chart
with one bar per supplier.

78
00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:20.490
The length of the bar is the total
shipments sent by the supplier, and

79
00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.260
the colors represent the customers.

80
00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:27.150
From the supplier side,
you can see that suppliers B, D and

81
00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.670
E supply to only one customer.

82
00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:32.030
From the customer's side,

83
00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:37.350
you can see that customer 3 receives
units from three different suppliers.

84
00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:41.120
The chart gives you insights
on the level of coordination

85
00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.950
that the solution requires.

86
00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:47.440
Clearly, it is easier to coordinate
shipments from a single supplier

87
00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.100
to a single customer.

88
00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.290
Now, let's take a look at
the capacity constraints.

89
00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:56.560
Instead of showing the values in the
sensitivity report, you can create a bar

90
00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:01.380
chart that compares the total shipments
and the capacity for each supplier.

91
00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:06.520
In this chart,
orange bars indicate capacity and

92
00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.360
the blue bars indicate total shipments.

93
00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:17.160
The chart reveals that three suppliers, A,
D, and E, utilize all of their capacity.

94
00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.910
On the other hand, suppliers B and
C, have extra capacity.

95
00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:25.550
As you know, the sensitivity report
includes reduced cost information.

96
00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:28.970
Reduced cost are a little
more difficult to visualize.

97
00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:34.180
The key concept as we discussed in our
previous video, is that at reduced cost

98
00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:38.380
tells you the amount by which
a current cost needs to decrease,

99
00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:40.600
in order to make it attractive.

100
00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:45.880
For example, these tables shows
the reduced costs for supplier A.

101
00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:48.940
Take a look at the first row
which corresponds to A1.

102
00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:56.060
This is the variable that represents the
units sent from supplier A to customer 1.

103
00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:01.340
In the optimal solution,
A1 has a value of 15 units.

104
00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:05.390
The cost of sending these
15 units is $3 per unit as

105
00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:07.189
shown by the objective coefficient.

106
00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:11.534
The reduced cost in this case is 0.

107
00:07:11.534 --> 00:07:16.331
Because $3 per unit is already
attracted to send units from

108
00:07:16.331 --> 00:07:18.503
supplier A to customer 1.

109
00:07:18.503 --> 00:07:20.980
Now take a look at A2.

110
00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:22.910
It's final value is 0.

111
00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:26.460
This means that at the current cost of 7,

112
00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:31.490
it is not attractive to send units
from supplier A to customer 2.

113
00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:36.070
The reduced cost is also 7, so
the cost has to drop to 0 for

114
00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:38.050
this option to be attractive.

115
00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:40.960
Well, this is probably
not going to happen.

116
00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:43.350
So if everything else stays the same,

117
00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:48.420
sending units from supplier A to
customer 2 is not a good idea.

118
00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:51.620
The best way to visualize this information

119
00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:55.780
is to convert all reduced
costs to negative values.

120
00:07:55.780 --> 00:08:01.530
Then you can create a bar chart that shows
the current costs as positive values,

121
00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:04.040
and the reduced costs as negative values.

122
00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:08.900
Do this only for
those variables with a final value of 0.

123
00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:15.150
The chart shows that there are variables,
such as A2, D2 and E3,

124
00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:21.820
that require very large cost reductions to
make those shipment options attractive.

125
00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:26.505
It also shows that it would require
a modest cost reduction for

126
00:08:26.505 --> 00:08:31.230
B4 and C4 to become viable options.

127
00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:36.040
In this video, you have learned how
to do a parameter analysis to review

128
00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:41.100
changes in the optimal solution
when key input data changes.

129
00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:45.590
Parameter analysis provides information
about the robustness of the solution

130
00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:50.846
in the face of uncertainty of input
values, such as customer demand.

131
00:08:50.846 --> 00:08:55.630
You have also learned how to present
results from an optimization model to

132
00:08:55.630 --> 00:09:00.740
those who might not be familiar with
prescriptive analytics concepts.

133
00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:02.481
This is pre-advanced analytics, and

134
00:09:02.481 --> 00:09:05.715
I'm glad that you're
mastering all these material.

135
00:09:05.715 --> 00:09:09.941
By the way, if you want to see
how the charts were created,

136
00:09:09.941 --> 00:09:15.302
you can review the Excel file
Transportation Problem- Visualization.
