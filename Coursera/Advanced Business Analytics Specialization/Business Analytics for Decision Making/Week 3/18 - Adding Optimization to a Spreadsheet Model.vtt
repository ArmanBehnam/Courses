1
00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.230
We have two choices to formulate and

2
00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:06.190
solve an optimization problem based
on an Excel spreadsheet model.

3
00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:11.680
One is using Excel's solver,
as we did in the cluster analysis module.

4
00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.770
And the other is by using
the Analytics Solver Platform.

5
00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:18.120
We're going to use the ASP here,

6
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.900
because it has more functionality
than the Excel solver.

7
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.140
And we will need that functionality
in the last module of our course.

8
00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.720
Locate and open the Excel file titled
Transportation Problem- Model.

9
00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.200
This is the model that we
developed in our last video.

10
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.790
You should have the Analytics Solver
Platform loaded on your computer.

11
00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.470
If the software is not loaded,
watch the video Introduction to

12
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:48.680
the Analytic Solver Platform, and
come back when you have installed the ASP.

13
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.920
Click on the ASP tab and
locate the optimization model group.

14
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.365
This group contains the three major
elements that we have discussed in this

15
00:00:57.365 --> 00:01:00.820
module,decisions, constraints,
and objective.

16
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.780
Lets start with decisions.

17
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.590
Go to the name box located at
the left end of the formula bar.

18
00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.090
Select Shipments from the drop down menu.

19
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.330
Note that this causes the shipment cells,

20
00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.630
which are the decisions in our model,
to be highlighted.

21
00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.700
Click on Decisions and then select Normal.

22
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.540
In the Model tab of the Solver Options and
Model Specifications panel

23
00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:31.000
you will now see that Shipments have
been added as normal decision variables.

24
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.150
Now we'll take care of the constraints.

25
00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.980
Go to the name box and
select Shipped from the drop down menu.

26
00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:42.730
Click on the constraints tool and
select Normal and less than or equal.

27
00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:47.110
The word Shipped appears on the left
hand side of the constraint.

28
00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:54.210
Click on the right hand side text box and
then select the range G6 to G10.

29
00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.590
The word Capacity appears on the right
hand side of the constraint.

30
00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.870
Click on OK,
to add the capacity constraints.

31
00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:05.660
Go to the name box and
select Received from the drop down menu.

32
00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:11.080
Click on the constraints tool, and
select Normal, and greater than or equal.

33
00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.142
The word Received appears on the left
hand side of the constraint.

34
00:02:15.142 --> 00:02:20.730
Click on the right hand side text box,
and select the range, C11 to F11.

35
00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.210
The word, Demand, appears on the right
hand side of the constraint.

36
00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.950
Click on OK to add the demand constraints.

37
00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.340
You can verify that in
the Solver options panel the two

38
00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.460
sets of constraints have been added.

39
00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.385
We need to add the special set of
constraints to make the decision variables

40
00:02:38.385 --> 00:02:39.305
non-negative.

41
00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.090
Go to the name box and
select Shipments from the drop down menu.

42
00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:51.610
Click on Constraints and select Variable
Type/Bound and greater than or equal.

43
00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.450
Shipments appear on the left
hand side of the constraint.

44
00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.070
Enter the number 0 on the right-hand
side box, and click OK.

45
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.509
The bounds have been added to the model,

46
00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:05.130
as you can see in
the Solver options panel.

47
00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.380
To complete the model,
we need to add the objective function.

48
00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:15.090
Go to the name box, and
select Total_Cost from the drop down menu.

49
00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.270
Click on Objective, and choose Normal Min.

50
00:03:20.438 --> 00:03:22.520
In the Solver options panel,

51
00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:27.160
we see that the objective of minimizing
total cost has been added to the model.

52
00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.640
Since we know that this model is linear,

53
00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.310
we should choose a linear
programming solution engine.

54
00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.090
Click on the Engine tab and

55
00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:42.190
choose the Standard LP/Quadratic Engine
from the drop down menu.

56
00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.670
Now we're ready to find an optimal
solution to this problem.

57
00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.480
Click on the Model tab and
then click on the Play button.

58
00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.150
The solution process for this linear model
is instantaneous, because it is a small

59
00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.880
problem, but also because,
as I mentioned in the introduction video,

60
00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.510
there are very efficient ways of
solving linear programming models.

61
00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.820
The solver indicates that it has a
solution, and that all the constraints and

62
00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.370
optimal conditions have been satisfied.

63
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.670
This means that the solver
guarantees that there are no

64
00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.690
feasible solutions with
a lower cost than 890.

65
00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.430
We can verify that the solution is
feasible by checking that the capacities

66
00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:29.200
have not been exceeded, and
that the demands have been satisfied.

67
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.710
We can also verify that all shipments
are greater than or equal to zero.

68
00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.330
If you go to the Data tab and

69
00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.720
click on the Solver tool that is
located in the analysis group,

70
00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:47.590
you will see that the optimization model
has been loaded in the Excel tool.

71
00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.489
So the solver in Excel and

72
00:04:49.489 --> 00:04:53.300
the optimization tool in
the ASP are comparable.

73
00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.790
This is why I mentioned at
the beginning of the video

74
00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:58.990
that either one could be
used to solve this problem.

75
00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.660
Let's summarize what we have done so far.

76
00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.210
We started with the description
of a problem and

77
00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.440
we identified the decisions,
constraints, and the objective.

78
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.190
We then formulated the problem
as a mathematical model.

79
00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.910
Based on that formulation,
we developed a spreadsheet model.

80
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.200
We added optimization to our spreadsheet
model, chose an appropriate solver for

81
00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:24.930
our model, and ran the solver
to find an optimal solution.

82
00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:29.789
The solution that we have found
prescribes the quantities to be

83
00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:32.609
shipped from each supplier
to each customer.

84
00:05:32.609 --> 00:05:33.665
In our next video,

85
00:05:33.665 --> 00:05:37.825
we will show how to perform what-if
analysis with an optimization model.
