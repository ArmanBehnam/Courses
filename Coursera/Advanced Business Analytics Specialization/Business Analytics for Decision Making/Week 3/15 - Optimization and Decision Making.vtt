00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.230
So far in this specialization,
we have focused on descriptive and

2
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:05.900
predictive analytics.

3
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.690
For managerial decisions that have
limited numbers of alternatives,

4
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.810
the tools that we have discussed up
to this point might be sufficient.

5
00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:18.750
However, for decision problems that have
a very large, or perhaps infinite number

6
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.790
of possible courses of action,
we need something different.

7
00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:25.800
This is why in this module
we introduce optimization,

8
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.990
the key tool in prescriptive analytics.

9
00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.700
Optimization has been defined as
the process of selecting the values of

10
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.740
decision variables that minimize or
maximize some quantity of interest.

11
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.440
Optimization is started in the area
of operations management, but

12
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.420
it is now used in all areas of business.

13
00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.690
Optimization models
are prescriptive because

14
00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.750
their outcome is
a recommendation of what to do.

15
00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:56.660
For example, in logistics, an optimization
model can recommend where to build

16
00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:02.590
a facility, or how to manage inventory or
how to route delivery tracks.

17
00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.020
In finance, optimization can
be used to find diversified

18
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.410
investment portfolios that
maximize returns, and limit risks.

19
00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:16.440
Optimization is a very rich area, and
the subject of many research articles and

20
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.880
books in this module we will
narrow our scope to linear models,

21
00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.160
which will help you tackle
many business problems.

22
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.560
Optimization models consist
of three major elements,

23
00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.680
decision variables,
an objective function, and constraints.

24
00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.920
Decision variables are the unknowns for

25
00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.640
which the optimization process
will find the best values.

26
00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.720
Depending on the context, decision
variables could represent quantities

27
00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.360
to produce, quantities to ship from
one warehouse to a customer, or

28
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.700
the amount of money to spend in
various types of digital ads.

29
00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:57.970
The objective of an optimization model is
to either minimize or maximize a function.

30
00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.200
Typically, models are set up to
maximize a function of revenue or

31
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.689
to minimize a function of cost.

32
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.150
Constraints are restrictions or
limitations that are either related to

33
00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:14.430
technical and practical considerations or
they're imposed by managerial policies.

34
00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:15.360
For instance,

35
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.030
the capacity of a truck represents
a physical constraint while requiring that

36
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.340
10% of an advertising budget to be spent
in YouTube ads is a managerial policy.

37
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.520
The difficulty with solving optimization
problems is determined by the interaction

38
00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.650
of the three major elements.

39
00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.320
For most models,

40
00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.660
the difficulty increases with the number
of decision variables and constraints.

41
00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.870
The process of building an optimization
model consists of translating a problem

42
00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:50.820
description into mathematical functions
that are based on the decision variables.

43
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.030
The transportation problem is a classic
in the optimization literature and

44
00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.750
we're going to use it to
illustrate these ideas.

45
00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.890
In the transportation problem, there is
a set of suppliers and a set of customers.

46
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.440
For the sake of simplicity, we are going
to assume that there is only one type of

47
00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.700
product that needs to be sent
from suppliers to customers.

48
00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.290
Suppliers have limited quantities of
the product to meet the customer demands.

49
00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.903
There's a cost associated with sending one
unit of product from each supplier to each

50
00:03:20.903 --> 00:03:22.430
customer.

51
00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.810
In this example, we have five
suppliers and four customers and

52
00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.170
therefore, there are 20
transportation processes.

53
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.970
The input data for this problem consists
of three sets of values, the supply,

54
00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.579
the demand and the transportation process.

55
00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.440
A solution to the problem is a set of
shipments that meets all the demand and

56
00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.430
does not exceed the supply.

57
00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:50.650
For example, in the solution supplier
A sends 50 units of product to customer 4.

58
00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.915
Supplier B sends 20 units to customer
2 and 20 units to customer 3.

59
00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.830
The solution is feasible because
it satisfies all the demands

60
00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.550
while staying within the capacity
limits of its supplier.

61
00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:07.720
Now we need to know how good
this feasible solution is.

62
00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.300
Measuring the quality of a solution is
the role of the objective function.

63
00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.920
In the transportation problem,
the Objective Function is the Total Cost.

64
00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:21.760
To calculate the total cost all we need to
do is to multiply the amount being shipped

65
00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.130
by the shipment cost and
add up all these values.

66
00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.406
The total cost for this solution is 1,085.

67
00:04:30.406 --> 00:04:33.420
How does this solution compare to others?

68
00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.980
Is this a solution with minimal cost?

69
00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:40.300
Well, we don't know, but optimization
provides the answers to these questions.

70
00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.790
An important feature of
optimization models is that, often,

71
00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:50.770
the same model can be reinterpreted to be
used in more than one setting or industry.

72
00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.860
For instance, rental car companies
sometimes find themselves in situations

73
00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.790
where their inventory
of cars is unbalanced.

74
00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:03.400
There may be an excess of certain
types of cars in some locations and

75
00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.290
a deficit in others.

76
00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:07.610
In terms of the transportation mall,

77
00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:12.580
the locations with excess cars can
be interpreted as supply locations.

78
00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:17.340
And the locations with deficits can
be interpreted as demand locations.

79
00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.430
A transportation model can
help a rental car company

80
00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.370
decide how to move cars from
one location to another.

81
00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:29.110
The cost could reflect not only distance
from one location to another, but

82
00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.600
also the transportation mode that
is used to transfer the vehicles,

83
00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:38.140
because they could be driven or moved on a
truck to preserve the mileage of the car.

84
00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:43.820
Optimization is a very exciting field
within data analytics for business.

85
00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:47.630
There are applications of
optimization everywhere.

86
00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:52.430
I am sure that you will start identifying
optimization problems in your everyday

87
00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:56.326
life, once you learn the basics
of optimization in this course.
