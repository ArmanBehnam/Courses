00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.980
In the last video, we show how
a description can be translated

2
00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.000
into a mathematical formulation
of an optimization problem.

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.410
Personally, I believe that there is a lot
of value in creating these formulations

4
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.480
before using optimization
software to solve the problem.

5
00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.430
However, the reality is that many analysts
go directly from the problem description

6
00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.600
to the software, and
skip the formulation step.

7
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.400
Either way you do it, ultimately,

8
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.390
these optimization models
require specialized software.

9
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.760
Our optimization software is embedded
in the Analytic Solver Platform and

10
00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.970
it operates on a spreadsheet
model of the problem.

11
00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.760
So in this video, we are going to develop
a spreadsheet model that can be used for

12
00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.460
the optimization of
the transportation problem.

13
00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.590
Locate and open the Excel file
titled Transportation Problem-Data.

14
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.950
This file contains a spreadsheet with
the problem data shown in a single table.

15
00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.440
The values in C6 to

16
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.700
F10 are the transportation costs
from each supplier to each customer.

17
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:09.390
The values in G6 to G10
are the capacity of each supplier.

18
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.130
And the values in C11
to F11 are the demands.

19
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.920
The first thing that we're going to do is
to select the entire table and copy it.

20
00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.948
We're then going to paste it on B13.

21
00:01:23.948 --> 00:01:26.940
Change the title of the new
table from Data to Model.

22
00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.070
Delete all the data values so we can
enter the appropriate Excel functions.

23
00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.950
Select the range C16 to G21 and
hit the Delete key.

24
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.640
Our 20 decision variables will
be in the range from C16 to F20.

25
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:47.700
In our models,

26
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.050
we have been using light gold to indicate
that the cells are decision variables.

27
00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.515
So we select the decision variable
range and click on light gold.

28
00:01:56.515 --> 00:02:01.540
The values for the decision variables will
be determined by the optimization process.

29
00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.040
But it is good practice
when building models to

30
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.820
enter some values to help us verify
that our spreadsheet model works.

31
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.770
So enter the solution that I showed to
you in the introduction to this module.

32
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.750
In that solution, supplier A sends
its 50 units to customer 4.

33
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.110
Therefore, enter 50 in cell F16.

34
00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.250
Supplier B sends 20 units to customer
2 and 20 units to customer 3.

35
00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:33.200
Enter 20 in cell D17 and 20 in E17.

36
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.370
Supplier C sends its 60
units to customer 1.

37
00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.390
Enter 60 in C18.

38
00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:47.370
Supplier D sends 15 units to customer
1 and 15 units to customer 3.

39
00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:54.240
Enter 15 in cell C19 and 15 in cell E19.

40
00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:00.760
Finally, supplier E sends 5 units
to customer 2 and 15 to customer 4.

41
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.490
So enter 5 in D20 and 15 in F20.

42
00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.280
We have a complete solution, but
we need to verify that it is feasible.

43
00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.750
A feasible solution is one that
satisfies all the constraints.

44
00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.280
Let's first see if the solution
satisfies the capacity constraints.

45
00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:26.019
We first change the title from
Capacity to Shipped in cell G14.

46
00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:29.949
The cells in the range from
D16 to D20 will contain

47
00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:34.155
the total number of units
shipped from each supplier.

48
00:03:34.155 --> 00:03:36.455
To calculate what a supplier ships,

49
00:03:36.455 --> 00:03:39.825
add all the quantities that
are shipped to all the customers.

50
00:03:39.825 --> 00:03:42.390
This can be done with the sum function.

51
00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:48.090
Go to cell G16 and enter =sum(,

52
00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:53.340
and select the range C16 to F16 and
close the parentheses.

53
00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:57.860
Cells G16 should now show 50.

54
00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.420
Select G16 and

55
00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.790
copy the cell down to G20 by dragging
it from the bottom right corner marker.

56
00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.120
The amounts shipped should not
exceed the supplier capacities shown

57
00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.750
on the data table.

58
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.470
This tells us that
the solution is feasible with

59
00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.850
respect to the capacity constraints.

60
00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:20.310
We are now going to verify that
the demand constraints are satisfied.

61
00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:25.247
We start by changing the title
Demand in B21 to Received.

62
00:04:25.247 --> 00:04:30.322
Then, in cell C21,
use again the function sum to calculate

63
00:04:30.322 --> 00:04:35.430
the total number of units
that customer 1 will receive.

64
00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.927
Enter =sum(, then select the range

65
00:04:39.927 --> 00:04:45.020
C16 to C20 and close parentheses.

66
00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:52.404
Then, copy the formula by dragging it from
the bottom right corner of C21 to F21.

67
00:04:52.404 --> 00:04:55.255
The values received by
the customers should be

68
00:04:55.255 --> 00:04:59.390
at least as large as the demand
values on the data table.

69
00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:03.410
This means that the solution
is also feasible with respect

70
00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.420
to the demand constraints.

71
00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.695
Now we only need to add
the objective function.

72
00:05:07.695 --> 00:05:10.710
Recall that the objective in the model

73
00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:15.201
is to find a feasible shipment
that minimize the total cost.

74
00:05:15.201 --> 00:05:20.330
Also recall that we calculated the total
cost as the sum of the products

75
00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.330
of unit shipped multiplied
by cost per unit.

76
00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.970
Excel includes a very useful function
to calculate this in one step.

77
00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.620
The function is called sumproduct.

78
00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:36.030
Go to cell B23 and enter Total Cost.

79
00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:42.670
Then go to cell C23 and
enter =sumproduct( and

80
00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:47.410
first select the cost
in the range C6 to F10.

81
00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:54.290
Enter a comma, and
then select the shipments in cells C16

82
00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:57.040
to F20 and close parentheses.

83
00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.691
After pressing Enter,

84
00:05:58.691 --> 00:06:04.310
you will see that the function correctly
calculates the total cost of 1085.

85
00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:09.617
As the last step, we will add some useful
formatting to the objective function,

86
00:06:09.617 --> 00:06:13.310
and we will also define names for
the cells in our model.

87
00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:18.030
Select cells B23 and C23 and add borders,

88
00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:23.630
and select C23 and
add a light orange background.

89
00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:28.160
This is the color that we have used
throughout the course to indicate

90
00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:29.880
output cells.

91
00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.510
Select the range G6 to G10,

92
00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:38.341
click the name box at the left end of
the formula bar, and type Capacity.

93
00:06:38.341 --> 00:06:45.860
Select the range C11 to F11,
click the name box, and type Demand.

94
00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:53.440
Select the range C16 to F20,
click the name box, and type Shipments.

95
00:06:54.580 --> 00:07:01.510
Select the range G12 to G20,
click the name box, and type Shipped.

96
00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:07.930
Select the range C21 to F21,
click the name box, and type Received.

97
00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:15.532
And then select the cell C23,
click the name box, and type Total_Cost.

98
00:07:15.532 --> 00:07:21.670
Our spreadsheet model is able to evaluate
the total cost of any set of shipments.

99
00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:24.690
We just need to change the values
of the decision variables.

100
00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:27.700
And the spreadsheet
calculates the total cost and

101
00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:30.670
updates the quantities shipped and
received.

102
00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:33.730
We could do some
What-If Analysis in this way.

103
00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:38.420
But it wouldn't be practical to try
to find the minimum cost solution

104
00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:41.550
by manually changing the shipment values.

105
00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:43.919
There are just way too many
shipment combinations.

106
00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:48.730
Fortunately, there is software
that can help us with this.

107
00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:50.078
In the next video,

108
00:07:50.078 --> 00:07:54.729
we will learn how to add optimization
to this spreadsheet model.
