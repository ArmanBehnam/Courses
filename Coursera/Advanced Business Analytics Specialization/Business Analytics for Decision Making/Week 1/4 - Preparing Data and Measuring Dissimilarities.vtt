1
00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.310
By now, you should have an understanding
of what cluster analysis is.

2
00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.400
And also, a good grasp on the type
of business questions that this

3
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.070
technique is able to answer.

4
00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:11.670
Before we review the methods for

5
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.340
performing the analysis,
we need to discuss data preparation.

6
00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.440
And we also need to discuss
how clustering methods

7
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.652
measure the similarity
between observations.

8
00:00:21.652 --> 00:00:27.070
While datasets could contain
a wide variety of data types.

9
00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:32.850
For the purpose of this discussion we
will focus on two most common data types,

10
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.990
numerical and categorical.

11
00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:39.630
Numerical variables include quantities
that may be continuous, such as time.

12
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.960
Or integer, such as number of purchases or
number of dependents.

13
00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.860
Categorical variables may be ordinal or
nominal.

14
00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.810
An ordinal variable implies
some sort of ranking.

15
00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:55.740
For instance, a customer satisfaction
rating is stated as high,

16
00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.680
medium, and low, implies an order.

17
00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.060
Therefore, a value transformation to
a numerical variable will be to make

18
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.870
high equal to 3,
medium equal to 2 and low equal to 1.

19
00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:12.770
Note that these transformations imply
that the difference between high and

20
00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.180
medium is the same as the difference
between medium and low.

21
00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.930
Nominal variables on the other hand,
can be thought of representing choices.

22
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.150
Political party affiliations
are nominal data.

23
00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:30.030
In the United States for example,
this nominal data would indicate Democrat,

24
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.610
Republican, or Independent voters.

25
00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.510
These choices do not imply
any particular order, and

26
00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.880
therefore they cannot be transformed
into a single numerical variable.

27
00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.650
The transformation
requires binary variables.

28
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.080
A binary variable has two possible values,
0 and 1.

29
00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.130
The number of binary variables needed for

30
00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.255
the transformation is equal to
the number of categories minus 1.

31
00:01:54.255 --> 00:01:58.030
Note that in the transformation for
the political affiliation,

32
00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.050
we use two binary variables,
because there are three categories.

33
00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.544
A Democrat is transformed into a value of
1 for variable 1, and a variable of 0 for

34
00:02:06.544 --> 00:02:07.396
a variable 2.

35
00:02:07.396 --> 00:02:10.940
A Republican is transformed
into a value of 0 for

36
00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.710
variable 1, and
a value of 1 for variable 2.

37
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.260
And then Independent has a value of 0 for
both variables.

38
00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.480
A special case of nominal data occurs
when there are only two categories.

39
00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.910
For instance, yes or no options.

40
00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.960
For yes is typically given the value of 1,
and no is given the value of 0.

41
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.913
Most software packages for data analysis
include tools that can transform

42
00:02:35.913 --> 00:02:41.180
categorical data that is given in
the form of text to numerical variables.

43
00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.053
Although software can perform these
transformations automatically.

44
00:02:45.053 --> 00:02:48.619
It is always good to verify how
categorical variables are being

45
00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:54.295
transformed, to avoid problems such as the
software treating nominal data as ordinal.

46
00:02:54.295 --> 00:02:59.660
Datasets may contain variables with
values that are on very different scales.

47
00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.342
Therefore it is recommended to perform
data analysis, such as clustering.

48
00:03:04.342 --> 00:03:09.700
On normalized, or also called standardized
data instead of the original data.

49
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.230
Normalization takes care of differences in
scale by transforming each original value

50
00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.150
to its standard value.

51
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.093
The operation consists of
subtracting the mean and

52
00:03:19.093 --> 00:03:21.910
dividing by the standard deviation.

53
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.641
In this example, we have age and
income data for five people.

54
00:03:26.641 --> 00:03:33.949
The average age of the sample is 42.20
years and the average income is 105,000.

55
00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:38.906
The last two columns of the table
show the normalized values, for

56
00:03:38.906 --> 00:03:43.338
instance, the normalized
age of Ann is -0.4948.

57
00:03:43.338 --> 00:03:47.510
Which is the result of subtracting
the average age of the group,

58
00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.771
which is 42.20 years from Ann's age,
which is 35 years.

59
00:03:51.771 --> 00:03:55.740
And then dividing by
the standard deviation of 14.55.

60
00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.290
The normalized value means that Ann's

61
00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.250
age is 0.4948 standard
deviations below the mean.

62
00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.950
The normalized values for age and
income are now on the same scale.

63
00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.280
That is with an average of 0 and
a standard deviation of 1.

64
00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:15.850
The normalized values allow us to
identify the outliers in our dataset.

65
00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:20.810
And they eliminate biases from variables
with relatively large original values.

66
00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.220
Also, normalized values enable
an easier interpretation of cluster

67
00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:26.680
analysis results.

68
00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.730
Since the mean of a normalized
variable is zero, we are able to

69
00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:35.260
easily detect values that are above the
mean and those that are below the mean.

70
00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.360
We're also able to know
how far a value is from

71
00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.220
the mean in terms of standard deviations.

72
00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.880
A normalized value for
instance of 1.7 means

73
00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:49.708
that the original value is 1.7
standard deviations above the mean.

74
00:04:49.708 --> 00:04:53.510
To do cluster analysis we need
a measure of distance, or

75
00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:56.310
the similarity between observations.

76
00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.835
The Euclidean distance is
the most commonly used measure of

77
00:04:59.835 --> 00:05:02.700
the similarity between two observations.

78
00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:07.320
This measure is the equivalent of the
straight line distance between two objects

79
00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.820
in a two-dimensional space.

80
00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:13.780
Using the normalized age and
income values in our previous example,

81
00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:18.250
we can compute the distances from
each pair of persons in our set.

82
00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:21.670
For instance,
the distance between David and Ann, or

83
00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:23.930
the distance between David and Clara.

84
00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:28.130
Then a scatter plot can be used to
create a graphical representation

85
00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:31.080
of the distance between
each pair of observations.

86
00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.805
The plot shows that in terms of age and
income,

87
00:05:34.805 --> 00:05:40.330
David is at least three times closer or
more similar to Ann, than he is to Clara.

88
00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.745
This make sense,
since David is both closer in age and

89
00:05:43.745 --> 00:05:46.675
income to Ann, than he is to Clara.

90
00:05:46.675 --> 00:05:50.925
Now that we have a way to measure
distances between observations,

91
00:05:50.925 --> 00:05:55.560
we need to establish a measure
of distance between clusters.

92
00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.670
There are five distance
measures between clusters.

93
00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:02.310
And they are single linkage,
complete linkage,

94
00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:06.660
average linkage, average group linkage,
and Ward's method.

95
00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:10.990
In single linkage the distance
between two clusters is determined by

96
00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:16.350
the minimum distance between every pair of
objects that are not in the same cluster.

97
00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:21.170
Complete linkage uses a maximum
distance between objects that are not

98
00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:22.870
in the same cluster.

99
00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:28.270
Average linkage calculate the average of
all distances across the two clusters.

100
00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:32.340
Average group linkage is the distance
between the center of one cluster

101
00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:34.330
to the center of the other.

102
00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.720
Ward's method uses a sum
of squares criterion.

103
00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:42.670
The sum of squares refers to the squared
distance from each observation

104
00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:46.160
to the centroid of the cluster
to which it is assigned.

105
00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:50.380
Let's go through the calculations
using the data in our simple example.

106
00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:53.900
Suppose that Clara and
Erin form a cluster,

107
00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:58.780
the centroid of this cluster is
the average normalized values.

108
00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:04.250
So in our example we have 0.9828 and
0.0906 as the average of the normalized

109
00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:11.840
age and the average of the normalized
income for the members of the cluster.

110
00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:16.560
We then calculate the squared distance
from each cluster member to the centroid.

111
00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:20.752
The squared distance is calculated by
adding the squared differences for

112
00:07:20.752 --> 00:07:23.260
each variable value and the centroid.

113
00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:29.923
For example, Clara has a normalized age
of 1.567 and the centroid is 0.9828.

114
00:07:29.923 --> 00:07:33.579
So we square the difference
between these two numbers,

115
00:07:33.579 --> 00:07:36.318
we do the same for the normalized income.

116
00:07:36.318 --> 00:07:40.053
The result is a squared
distance of 0.3495.

117
00:07:40.053 --> 00:07:42.762
Then we go through the same
calculations for Erin.

118
00:07:42.762 --> 00:07:45.235
Because the cluster has only two members,

119
00:07:45.235 --> 00:07:48.470
the centroid is exactly
halfway between them.

120
00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:52.585
The sum of the squares for
this cluster is 0.699.

121
00:07:52.585 --> 00:07:53.881
The sum of squares for

122
00:07:53.881 --> 00:07:59.090
our complete solution is the aggregate of
sum of the squares for all the clusters.

123
00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:02.281
Since each cluster method may
generate a different outcome,

124
00:08:02.281 --> 00:08:06.350
it is generally recommended to
experiment and compare results.

125
00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:10.706
In this slide, we show how single
linkage does better than k-means and

126
00:08:10.706 --> 00:08:14.350
Ward's method in these
two-dimensional problems.

127
00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:18.400
However, no single method will
always outperform the others.

128
00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:22.150
We have reviewed three concepts
that are critical to performing

129
00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:23.840
a valid cluster analysis.

130
00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:26.370
First, data should be in the correct form

131
00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:30.450
by taking into consideration
what each variable represents.

132
00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:33.970
Second, and
a proper metric should be established

133
00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:37.990
to be able to measure the distance
between every pair of observations.

134
00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:43.560
And third, we must decide how distance
between clusters is going to be measured.

135
00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:48.153
We are now ready to review how the most
common clustering methods operate.
