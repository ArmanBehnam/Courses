00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:06.110
Welcome to the third course of the Data
Analytics for Business Specialization.

2
00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:07.320
In this course,

3
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:13.090
we describe how data analytics is used
to create models for decision making.

4
00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:13.860
The goal for

5
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.250
this course is to make the transition from
predictive models to prescriptive models.

6
00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:20.600
As the name indicates,

7
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:25.910
prescriptive analytic models
prescribe courses of action.

8
00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.470
This is done by establishing
an objective in the set of constraints.

9
00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.630
The course creates a bridge
between predicting outcomes, and

10
00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.390
prescribing solutions
to business problems.

11
00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.520
In Module one,
we started with cluster analysis.

12
00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.400
As my colleagues Dave and
Dan did in previous courses,

13
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.720
I will follow the same approach
of introducing modeling and

14
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.910
analysis techniques within
the context of business applications.

15
00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.440
For cluster analysis,
we will focus on market segmentation.

16
00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.660
The main idea in market segmentation is
to divide a broad market into segments or

17
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.270
clusters.

18
00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:09.390
The technique produces groups
whose members have similar needs,

19
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.960
interests, and priorities.

20
00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.690
These help companies design
a specific strategies.

21
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.540
For example, an advertising campaign, or

22
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.220
a set of promotions,
to target each market segment.

23
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.400
In the second model,

24
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.130
we examine the main techniques to deal
with uncertainty in business problems.

25
00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.680
We will discuss why
using average values for

26
00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.980
something that we don't know, for example
demand, is not always the best idea.

27
00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:42.250
Overbooking will be the main
business application in this module.

28
00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.190
This is the perfect example for
this module,

29
00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.870
because the uncertainty of whether a
customer will show up for an appointment,

30
00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:55.200
or a hotel reservation, or a flight,
has immediate revenue implications.

31
00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.410
In the third module, we will learn how to
develop and solve optimization models.

32
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.930
Optimization is a core technique
in prescriptive analytics.

33
00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.700
This makes a lot of sense, because
you want models that are able to find

34
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.580
the best possible course of action for
a given objective.

35
00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.700
The beauty of optimization is
that it is capable of examining

36
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.190
a very large number of possible
solutions to a problem.

37
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.940
So it does something that
would require a lot of effort

38
00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.460
if we had to do it by trial and error.

39
00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:31.690
We will use a transportation problem and
a decision problem in digital advertising,

40
00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.960
to illustrate how
optimization models work.

41
00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.330
Simulation optimization,
the topic of module four,

42
00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.260
is one of my favorite things to teach.

43
00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.030
In the Masters of Business Analytics
here at the University of Colorado,

44
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.970
Leeds School of Business,
we spend more time in this topic

45
00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.490
than the time that we're going to
be able to spend in this course.

46
00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.510
However, you will get a good
overview of the main concepts.

47
00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:02.200
The reason this is so exciting, is that
it combines simulation and optimization.

48
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.180
Simulation allows you to
model uncertainty, and

49
00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.390
when you combine it with optimization,

50
00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.200
you're able to determine the best course
of action in the face of uncertainty.

51
00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.680
I am glad that you're doing this
specialization, and that you're ready for

52
00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.540
this third course.

53
00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.259
I hope that you enjoyed taking it as much
as I have enjoyed putting it together.
