00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.530
Welcome to the first module of using
analytics to improve decision making

2
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:05.760
in business.

3
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.400
This is the third course in
the introduction to business analytics

4
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.920
specialization.

5
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.380
In this course,
we transition from the descriptive and

6
00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.510
predictive models that we
introduce in the second course,

7
00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.130
to the prescriptive models
that we will discuss here.

8
00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.700
We start this transition by answering
the question, what is cluster analysis?

9
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:31.030
As discussed in the two previous courses,
there are three types of analytics models,

10
00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:34.660
descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive.

11
00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.520
Cluster analysis is one of those,
so called, data mining tools.

12
00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.330
These tools are typically considered
predictive, but since they help managers

13
00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.640
make better decisions,
they can also be considered prescriptive.

14
00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.000
The boundaries between descriptive,
predictive and

15
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.980
prescriptive analytics are not precise.

16
00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.700
However, as we move from descriptive to
predictive and then prescriptive models,

17
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.070
it is fair to say that the analysis
tends to be a bit more complex.

18
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.800
But it's very useful if it is done well,
cluster analysis refers to a technique for

19
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.970
identifying groups in which
the elements of each group are similar.

20
00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.293
The approach is often used in marketing
in order to understand differences

21
00:01:18.293 --> 00:01:19.490
among customers.

22
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.360
The main idea of this
application of cluster analysis

23
00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.470
is to create homogeneous market
segments to target product offerings.

24
00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.367
In this graphical representation we show
how in practice is not possible to find

25
00:01:32.367 --> 00:01:34.426
perfectly homogeneous groups.

26
00:01:34.426 --> 00:01:39.273
However, the groups resulting from
cluster analysis are similar in some way.

27
00:01:39.273 --> 00:01:43.799
For example,
the orange cluster includes round objects.

28
00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.542
Not all of them are of the same color or
size, and

29
00:01:47.542 --> 00:01:51.203
some are crossed out,
but they are all round.

30
00:01:51.203 --> 00:01:56.198
The objects in the green and blue clusters
are also similar among themselves,

31
00:01:56.198 --> 00:01:59.240
but they are not exactly the same.

32
00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.540
What is important is to be
able to describe each cluster.

33
00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:03.800
In this simple example,

34
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.640
the orange cluster may be described as
a group of multi-colored round objects.

35
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.110
The green cluster may be characterized
as a group of square objects.

36
00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.670
And the blue cluster consists of
triangular and diamond-shaped objects.

37
00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.230
Now, let's take a look
at a real world example.

38
00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.180
Consumers around the world continue to
embrace natural and organic products.

39
00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.740
Consumers have become
increasingly concerned

40
00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.490
about what is in their products they buy.

41
00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:35.970
They have created an industry that,
in 2012, the market intelligence firm,

42
00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:42.210
Information Resources Inc., estimated
to be $81 billion in the United States.

43
00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:45.660
Information resources
survey 5,000 customers and

44
00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.800
match the participants answers with
the actual purchasing behavior.

45
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.810
The analysis of the data focus
on segmenting the US market

46
00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.840
by considering relationships
between shoppers and

47
00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.330
natural, organic, and
eco-friendly products.

48
00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.010
The market segmentation was
assigned to help manufacturers and

49
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.080
retailers to achieve new levels of growth

50
00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.060
through a better understanding
of these shoppers needs.

51
00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.800
The cluster analysis identified seven
consumer segments based on lifestyle,

52
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.545
history of purchasing organic and

53
00:03:16.545 --> 00:03:21.410
natural products, attitudes towards these products, and demographics.

54
00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:26.436
These segments were labeled as True
Believers, Enlightened Environmentalist,

55
00:03:26.436 --> 00:03:30.889
Strapped Seekers, Healthy Realists,
Indifferent Traditionalists,

56
00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:34.276
Struggling Switchers and
Resistant Non-believers.

57
00:03:34.276 --> 00:03:37.400
Detecting the segments
that are good targets for

58
00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.137
natural and organic markets was one
of the main outcomes of the analysis.

59
00:03:42.137 --> 00:03:43.171
True Believers and

60
00:03:43.171 --> 00:03:46.925
Enlightened Environmentalists were
identified as a key segments.

61
00:03:46.925 --> 00:03:51.044
They represent 18% of the population but
together,

62
00:03:51.044 --> 00:03:54.206
they drive nearly half of the total sales.

63
00:03:54.206 --> 00:03:59.327
True Believers are passionate about
staying fit and healthy, they are focused

64
00:03:59.327 --> 00:04:04.231
on trying new things and serving as
a strong role models for their children.

65
00:04:04.231 --> 00:04:08.553
They are strong believers in the benefit
of natural and organic products,

66
00:04:08.553 --> 00:04:12.010
their median income is
highest among all segments.

67
00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:17.440
Their average age is 40 and
they have at least a college education.

68
00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.420
Enlightened Environmentalists
are passionate about the environment and

69
00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.230
about making good choices to preserve it.

70
00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:27.680
These shoppers are committed
to make healthier choices and

71
00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:33.430
go out of their way to shop at stores
that carry natural and organic products.

72
00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.810
Enlightened Environmentalist
are older than True Believers

73
00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:41.810
averaging 63 years old, but
have a slightly lower median income.

74
00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.530
It is interesting to note that the
analysis show that both of these segments

75
00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:51.750
shared the same top priorities regarding
food, home care, and personal care.

76
00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.750
The importance of this cluster analysis,

77
00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.130
is that it was able to identify
groups of manufacturers and

78
00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.760
retailers who can motivate to learn
more about organic and natural products.

79
00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.481
For example, the analysis show
that the Strapped Seekers and

80
00:05:06.481 --> 00:05:11.383
Healthy Realist are a strong target,
driving 24% of sales,

81
00:05:11.383 --> 00:05:14.680
or representing 25% of the consumers.

82
00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.800
Strapped Seekers believe and seek natural
products, when their budget allows it.

83
00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.420
They realize the benefit of natural and
organic products and

84
00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:28.550
have the potential of becoming
True Believers as their income increases.

85
00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.920
Healthy Realists are passionate
about being fit but

86
00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:35.759
find it difficult deciding whether to
buy healthy or traditional products.

87
00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:41.120
Closer analysis show that not
all segments are worth pursuing.

88
00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.590
Indifferent Traditionalists lead
a simple life with few passions.

89
00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:49.210
They are not likely to buy
natural/organic products because

90
00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:51.210
they don't see the reason to change.

91
00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:55.510
Struggling Switchers know that they
should be eating healthier and

92
00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:59.580
exercising more but
focus on staying within their budgets.

93
00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:04.140
Resistant Non-believers got very little
desire to support all their options for

94
00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:07.960
things to buy, so
they stay loyal to the products they know.

95
00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.630
Market segmentation is not
the only application of cluster

96
00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:13.390
analysis in business.

97
00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:18.060
Clustering is also used in market
strategies such as product and

98
00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:19.520
price segmentation.

99
00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:24.100
Because applications in areas such as
human resources and operations management.

100
00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:29.510
In product segmentation, closer
analysis identifies groups of consumers

101
00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:35.340
who want different benefits or levels
of functionality of a product category.

102
00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:39.030
The results are used to offer
different versions of a product,

103
00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:43.750
in order to match consumers
needs more precisely.

104
00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:46.590
Coffee producers, for
example, offer regular and

105
00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:49.270
decaffeinated versions of the same brand.

106
00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:53.890
In brand segmentation the same
product is offered at different prices

107
00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:55.710
to different groups.

108
00:06:55.710 --> 00:07:00.830
Higher prices are offered to customers in
groups that are willing to pay for extras

109
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:06.660
or pay for better quality packaging,
or for additional customer services.

110
00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:10.960
In human resources, clustering could
identify characteristics of successful

111
00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:15.790
employees in order to improve
recruiting and hiring practices.

112
00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:20.220
Grouping customers by geographical
areas is a typical application

113
00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:23.080
of cluster analysis in
operations management.

114
00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:28.824
We have shown how cluster analysis can be
very useful as a market segmentation tool.

115
00:07:28.824 --> 00:07:33.620
In this module, we will explore additional
clustering applications, but first,

116
00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:37.687
we will learn how to perform the analysis
and how to interpret results.
