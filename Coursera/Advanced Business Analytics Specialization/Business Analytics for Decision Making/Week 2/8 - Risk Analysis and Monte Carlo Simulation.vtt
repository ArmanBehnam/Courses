00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.550
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:06.220
Are you ready to learn more modeling
tools for business analytics?

3
00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.290
Great, because here in this module,

4
00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.036
we're going to take a look at the role
of the uncertainty in business problems.

5
00:00:12.036 --> 00:00:17.470
And we're also going to show how to create
models that can be used to measure risk.

6
00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:19.330
There are two types of uncertainty.

7
00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.540
In the first one, all possible outcomes
are known, and the probability for

8
00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.000
each outcome is either known or
can be estimated.

9
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.650
For example, when you roll a die, you know
that there are six possible outcomes.

10
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.700
And if the die is fair, each outcome
has the same probability of occurring.

11
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:42.024
Prior to the roll, we know the number of
outcomes, we know what the outcomes are,

12
00:00:42.024 --> 00:00:46.220
and we know that the probability
of each outcome is one sixth.

13
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.990
In the second type of uncertainty,

14
00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.570
we don't know the probabilities
of the outcomes.

15
00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.870
And in fact, we might not even know
what the possible outcomes are.

16
00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:55.540
In other words,

17
00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.780
there is total uncertainty, in the sense
that there is nothing measurable.

18
00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.445
For example, it is very difficult
to assess the probability that

19
00:01:03.445 --> 00:01:05.460
an idea becomes a successful business.

20
00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.630
This is a very complex problem that
depends on way too many factors and

21
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.290
sources of uncertainty.

22
00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.610
And this is why you often hear that
successful entrepreneurs are not the ones

23
00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.110
that have one great idea, but
actually the ones that have lots of ideas.

24
00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.780
In risk analysis, we are interested
in the first type of uncertainty.

25
00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.770
That is, the one for
which we either know or

26
00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.710
we can estimate the probability
of each outcome.

27
00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.730
The reason is simple, this type of
uncertainty is the one that we can

28
00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:38.710
measure, and therefore we're able
to create models to assess risk.

29
00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.580
These models take into
consideration that some

30
00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.170
elements are not known with certainty.

31
00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.200
For instance, let's consider profit,

32
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.980
which is probably the most fundamental
mathematical model in business.

33
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.510
Profit is calculated as the difference
between revenue and cost.

34
00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.800
Let's suppose that we know exactly
how much everything is going to cost

35
00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.470
to make a unit of a product
that we want to sell.

36
00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.270
It's not a very realistic assumption,
but let's just go with it.

37
00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.130
To make it simple, we're also going
to assume that the single source of

38
00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.280
revenue for this business is what we
collect from the selling of this product.

39
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.410
If we're the ones determining
the price of the product,

40
00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.180
then all we need to do to
calculate profit is to multiply

41
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.270
the number of units sold by the price per
unit, and then subtract all the cost.

42
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:28.000
Calculating profit is very simple once
we know how many units we have sold.

43
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.270
But if we want to do some planning based
on future revenues, then things get a bit

44
00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.620
more complicated, because we need
to be able to estimate demand.

45
00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.170
If we take a very simplistic approach,
we might just say that demand

46
00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.120
is going to stay steady, and
therefore we will estimate

47
00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.000
future demand with just the average
demand that we have observed so far.

48
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.170
And this could work well in environments
where things don't change much.

49
00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.520
The reality is that in most situations,

50
00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.670
things don't stay exactly the same
from one period to another.

51
00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.670
We must consider variability, and

52
00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.800
it is precisely this variability,
the one that produces uncertainty.

53
00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.820
What we want the models to be
able to capture is uncertainty

54
00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.660
that is related to elements that
include some level of randomness.

55
00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.530
We want to extract historical patterns
that can help us assess risk.

56
00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.800
As we mentioned earlier, the key is to
be able to determine all outcomes and

57
00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.300
the probabilities.

58
00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.640
For example, would you invest in
a stock that is expected to double its

59
00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.070
price within a year?

60
00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.370
Well this seems like
a pretty good opportunity.

61
00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.048
But the key word here is expected.

62
00:03:31.048 --> 00:03:35.400
Expected values don't tell you anything
about the range of outcomes and

63
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.080
their probabilities.

64
00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.390
With this limited information we
simply don't know what the risk is.

65
00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.097
Decisions involve risk and

66
00:03:43.097 --> 00:03:47.380
attitudes toward risk vary
from one person to another.

67
00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.790
Some can tolerate more, and some less.

68
00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.230
But we all need to have a way of
measuring the amount of risk involved.

69
00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.530
Risk analysis can be done at
several levels of complexity.

70
00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.680
At the very basic level, we could do
a best case, worst case analysis.

71
00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.270
Let's suppose that we have a spread sheet
model in which some cells represent data

72
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:08.590
with uncertainty.

73
00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.900
For example, we could have some cells
that represent uncertain demand.

74
00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:17.230
For the base case, we plug in the most
optimistic values in each of these cells.

75
00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:19.960
We can then see what happens
to the outcome cell.

76
00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:23.940
In the worst case scenario,
we plug in the most pessimistic values for

77
00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.250
the uncertain cells.

78
00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.340
And once again,
we check what happens to the output cells.

79
00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.700
This is easy to do, but it doesn't give
us information about the distribution of

80
00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.670
all possible outcomes between the best and
the worst cases.

81
00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:41.090
Take a look at these distributions of
values between the best and the worst.

82
00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.910
All of these distributions have
the same best and worst outcomes, and

83
00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.940
even the same average outcome, but
they certainly don't look alike.

84
00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:53.890
The bell shape distribution tells us that
the average is the most likely outcome,

85
00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:58.780
and the values deviate above and below
the average with the same probability.

86
00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:04.360
The distribution in the form of a U tells
us that the average almost never happens

87
00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:09.790
and that it's as likely to get the worst
possible outcome as it is to get the best.

88
00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:13.510
Most people would associate this
distribution to a risky situation.

89
00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:17.270
The other two distributions have
long tails indicating that extreme

90
00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:21.640
values do not happen often, but they
could happen with a small probability.

91
00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.230
These distributions illustrate
that examining only the best and

92
00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:29.080
the worst possible outcomes is
a limited analysis that ignores

93
00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.940
a lot of valuable information.

94
00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.470
You now might be wondering well,

95
00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:37.680
then how can we get the values in
between the best and the worst?

96
00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:42.420
And the answer is Monte Carlo Simulation,
a predictive analytics tool.

97
00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:46.200
The name of this methodology comes
from the famous casino in Monaco, and

98
00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.890
it has a very interesting story that
dates back to the experiments that took

99
00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:52.690
place during the development
of the atomic bomb.

100
00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:53.250
Here of course,

101
00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:56.930
we are going to focus on a more
peaceful application of this technique.

102
00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:01.000
And easy way of describing how Monte
Carlo Simulation works, is by assuming

103
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
that we have expression model in which
some of the cells contain certain values.

104
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.500
For example, suppose that the green cells
are the ones with the uncertain values,

105
00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.730
and that the orange cell is the outcome.

106
00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:15.730
For most models,
if we use expected values for

107
00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:20.300
the green cells, we obtain an expected
value for the orange cell.

108
00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:25.140
We can also plug in the worst and the best
estimates for the green cells, and

109
00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:29.020
observe the best and
the worst estimates for the orange cell.

110
00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:33.910
In general, any set of values for
the green cells generates a value for

111
00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:35.420
the orange cell.

112
00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:37.610
This is known as what-if analysis.

113
00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:40.720
If we plug in a lot of values for
the green cells, and

114
00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.160
then store all the resulting values for

115
00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:48.020
the orange cell, we could create
a picture of all possible outcomes.

116
00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:51.680
This picture is what we have
been calling a distribution.

117
00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:57.040
Plugging in a lot of numbers to create
a distribution is very tedious,

118
00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:00.970
and not only that, if we are the ones
choosing these input values,

119
00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:04.165
we're bound to introduce our
own biases in the process.

120
00:07:04.165 --> 00:07:07.015
And this is why we use
Monte Carlo Simulation.

121
00:07:07.015 --> 00:07:10.435
The method requires that
we make assumptions about

122
00:07:10.435 --> 00:07:13.185
how the values of
the uncertain cells behave.

123
00:07:13.185 --> 00:07:17.675
For instance, do the uncertain values
follow a uniform distribution?

124
00:07:17.675 --> 00:07:19.565
Or a normal distribution?

125
00:07:19.565 --> 00:07:23.545
We will see that these assumptions
are typically based on both experience and

126
00:07:23.545 --> 00:07:25.115
historical data.

127
00:07:25.115 --> 00:07:29.480
The quality of the model will depend on
how reasonable these assumptions are.

128
00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:33.570
But once we feel comfortable with the
assumptions about the uncertain values,

129
00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:37.900
the method will produce valuable
information about the outcomes.

130
00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:42.271
It is really exciting that, thanks to
advances in personal computing and

131
00:07:42.271 --> 00:07:45.300
software, we get to use a tool that,
not long ago,

132
00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:50.539
was only available to those with advanced
programming skills and powerful computers.
