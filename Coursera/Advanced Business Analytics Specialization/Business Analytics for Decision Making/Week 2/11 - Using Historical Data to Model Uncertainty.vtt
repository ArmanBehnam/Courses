1
00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.910
You now know how to create a simulation
model in the analytic software platform.

2
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.230
You also know how to run the model and
interpret the output.

3
00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.050
To create these models we have
made a critical assumption

4
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.620
about the source of uncertainty.

5
00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.150
We took the probability
distribution of the uncertain

6
00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.740
input variables as something
that was given to us.

7
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.760
Remember the other booking problem
that we have been discussing?

8
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.280
In that problem,
there are two sources of uncertainty.

9
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.240
The demand for seats in the flight and

10
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.815
the numbers of booked passengers
that actually show up.

11
00:00:35.815 --> 00:00:38.100
Or assumptions were that the demand for

12
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.520
seats follows a Poisson distribution
with an average of 150 passengers.

13
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.600
We also assume that the show-up process

14
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.880
could be modeled with
a Binomial distribution.

15
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.590
These are probably pretty
good assumptions, but

16
00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.550
you might be wondering how
in general we could come up

17
00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.750
with the right functions to model
the uncertainty of key input variables.

18
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.290
That's what we're going to
learn in this video.

19
00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.450
As he have mentioned before,
uncertainty comes from variability.

20
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.310
When we say that the average demand for
a flight is 150 passengers,

21
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:21.280
we don't expect that on every single day
the demand will be exactly 150 passengers.

22
00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.080
This is the difference between
an average value and a constant value.

23
00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.600
So, what we're saying,
is that the demand varies and

24
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.640
that it is possible to
calculate an average.

25
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.130
An average value is good information but
we want more.

26
00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.729
We want to know how the demand varies.

27
00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.990
They key is to estimate the probability
of distribution function for

28
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.480
critical inputs to a simulation model.

29
00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:54.300
And the way we are going to do that
is by analyzing historical data.

30
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.700
Locate and open the Excel file
flight over booking data.

31
00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.280
This workbook contains
two years of data for

32
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.030
the flight that we
are using as an example.

33
00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.420
The first column has a date,

34
00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.960
the second column the demand, the third
column has the number of passenger's vote.

35
00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.080
The fourth column has a number of
passengers that actually showed up, and

36
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.590
the fifth column has a fraction of
the book passengers that showed up.

37
00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.950
You can see that the demand
varies from day to day.

38
00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.520
You can also see that the fraction
of passengers that show up for

39
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.980
their flight also varies
from one day to another.

40
00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.360
Those are the two sources
of variability and,

41
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.076
therefore, also the two
sources of uncertainty.

42
00:02:35.076 --> 00:02:42.820
In cell H-1 we have calculated the average
demand, which is about 150 passengers.

43
00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.811
The show up rate of 92% is in cell H-2.

44
00:02:46.811 --> 00:02:51.650
If we look at the formula in H-2 we can
see that the show up rate is simply

45
00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.410
the average of the fraction of booked
passengers that have shown up for

46
00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.760
the flight in the two years of data.

47
00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.130
Generally speaking, simulation models
do not use historical data directly.

48
00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.520
The idea is to use the data to create
a so-called probability distribution

49
00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.470
function for each variable and then use
the function for the simulation model.

50
00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.250
The process of identifying an appropriate
probability distribution function for

51
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.590
a variable for which we have historical
data is called Distribution Fitting.

52
00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.100
The analytics of a platform includes
a distribution fitting tool.

53
00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.400
To use this tool we need to
start by selecting the cells

54
00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.630
where the historical data is.

55
00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.010
So let just start with the demand and
select cells B2 to B731.

56
00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.630
Know that in this case, I did select the
name of the variable which is in cell B1.

57
00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:51.280
Now, we go to the ASP tab and
in the tools group we find fit.

58
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.160
Click on fit and
the fit options dialogue appears.

59
00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.370
There are two general types of
this distribution functions,

60
00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.360
continuous and discrete.

61
00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.290
In this case we have discrete data and
we choose the discrete option.

62
00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.820
This is the only option
that we're going to change.

63
00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.370
We will leave the other options
under their full values.

64
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.840
Click the fifth button and
the results windows is displayed.

65
00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.320
The results window shows
the comparison chart.

66
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.380
This chart compares the frequency
distribution of the historical data in

67
00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:29.150
blue and the frequency of the proposed
distribution function in pink.

68
00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:35.070
The idea is to visually inspect how well
the proposed function fits their values.

69
00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:39.350
In this case the analysis is suggesting
a Poisson distribution with a mean

70
00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.850
value of 150.4 passengers.

71
00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.950
Other alternatives are shown in
the left panel of the window.

72
00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.760
These alternatives are shown
in order of fitness.

73
00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.090
So, the analysis is suggesting
that the Poisson is the best fit,

74
00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.250
followed by the negative Binomial.

75
00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.910
We're going to keep
the Poisson distribution as it

76
00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.030
looks like a good
representation of the demand.

77
00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:02.350
If we close this window,

78
00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:05.990
we are asked whether we want to
accept the fitted distribution.

79
00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:07.180
Say yes,

80
00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:12.450
the ASP then allows you to place the side
function somewhere on the spreadsheet.

81
00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.660
Place it in cell H4.

82
00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:19.450
We can verify that H4 now contains
this signed Poisson function

83
00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:21.855
with an average of 150.4.

84
00:05:21.855 --> 00:05:25.800
For the show up rate the processes
are slightly different.

85
00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:30.890
In our simulation we model the show
up rate as a Binomial distribution.

86
00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:35.580
The Binomial distribution makes a lot of
sense because given the number of trials

87
00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.260
and the probability of
success in each trial.

88
00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:42.410
The distribution represents the frequency
of the number of successes.

89
00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:47.230
The number of trials in our context
is the number of booked passengers.

90
00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:51.340
Success means that the passenger
shows up for the flight.

91
00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:55.659
Or best estimate of the show up rate
is not 92% which we've found by

92
00:05:55.659 --> 00:06:00.270
averaging the historical percentage
of passengers showing up.

93
00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:03.860
So we have a an estimate of
the probability of success.

94
00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:08.780
We also have the number of trials because
the number of booked passengers is known.

95
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:11.740
That means that we just need
to verify that the number

96
00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:17.210
passengers that show up for
the flight follow a binomial distribution.

97
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:20.120
We can use the fit tool to do this.

98
00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.420
Select the data on column D and
click on fit.

99
00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:28.410
Choose discrete for the type of
distribution and click on failed.

100
00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:31.700
The analysis shows that
the best distribution for

101
00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:33.910
this data is indeed
a Binomial distribution.

102
00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:39.600
ASB shows that the parameters
of this distribution are at 339.

103
00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:44.200
For the number of trials and point three
nine for the probability for success.

104
00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:47.610
However, these numbers are not
meaningful because we have

105
00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:52.625
already estimated the show up rate and for
each flight we know the number of trials.

106
00:06:52.625 --> 00:06:55.265
That is we know the number
of booked passengers.

107
00:06:55.265 --> 00:06:58.155
The distribution fitting
process has helped us verify

108
00:06:58.155 --> 00:07:01.795
that the Binomial distribution is
appropriate for the purpose of modeling

109
00:07:01.795 --> 00:07:06.375
the number of passengers that show
up out of a number that are booked.

110
00:07:06.375 --> 00:07:10.675
Distribution fitting is a very important
tool to convert data into probability

111
00:07:10.675 --> 00:07:14.875
distribution, for instance,
that can be used in a simulation model.

112
00:07:14.875 --> 00:07:19.270
It is possible to run what could
also be considered as simulation

113
00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:20.900
using historical data.

114
00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:25.990
And this is sometimes done to test how
a policy who have performed in the past.

115
00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:30.830
But distribution fading along with
simulation allows us to create

116
00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:34.640
many scenarios based on
what happen in the past.

117
00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:40.185
This is the most effective use of data in
the context of building simulation models.
