00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.401
In this video, we are going to discuss the
situation when variables are correlated.

2
00:00:05.401 --> 00:00:10.510
The correlation between two independent
variables is zero or nearly zero.

3
00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.237
And this is why we say that independent
variables are not correlated.

4
00:00:14.237 --> 00:00:18.984
The flight overbooking example that we
have been analyzing has two sources of

5
00:00:18.984 --> 00:00:20.420
uncertainty.

6
00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.490
Demand and number of booked passengers
that show up for their flights.

7
00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.780
We have been treating these variables
as independent of each other.

8
00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.440
That is, in our model,

9
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.350
the demand values are generated
independently of the show-up values.

10
00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.140
This could very well reflect how
things are in the real system.

11
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.900
However, there is an easy way of checking

12
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.670
whether these two
variables are independent.

13
00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.340
We just need to calculate
their correlation.

14
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:49.850
So let's do it.

15
00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.930
Open the Excel file
Flight Overbooking Data,

16
00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:58.700
which contains two years of data for the
flight that we have been using as example.

17
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:04.430
We would like to determine whether demand
and show-up rate are independent or not.

18
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.769
In cell D4, let's type Correlation.

19
00:01:06.769 --> 00:01:14.791
In cell H4, we enter the correlation
function C-O-R-R-E-L,

20
00:01:14.791 --> 00:01:21.280
which goes from b2:b731,e2:e731.

21
00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.820
This function returns a correlation
between the variable demand and

22
00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.530
the variable rate.

23
00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.070
The result is a correlation of almost 0.7.

24
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.230
Without going into details of how
correlation values are calculated,

25
00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:39.180
we know that they can vary from -1 and 1.

26
00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.420
As I mentioned earlier, for independent
variables, the correlation is near 0.

27
00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.246
So a value of 0.7 indicates
a large positive correlation.

28
00:01:48.246 --> 00:01:53.367
Positive correlation in our example
means that when demand is high,

29
00:01:53.367 --> 00:01:56.170
the show-up rate is also high.

30
00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.110
We can think of these variables as
pointing in the same direction.

31
00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.580
This analysis tells us that our simulation
model can be improved to reflect

32
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.350
more of what is really happening
in our flight overbooking problem.

33
00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.732
Adding correlation coefficients
between uncertain variables is fairly

34
00:02:12.732 --> 00:02:14.045
straightforward.

35
00:02:14.045 --> 00:02:15.455
So let's go ahead and do it.

36
00:02:15.455 --> 00:02:20.035
Locate and open the Excel file
Flight Overbooking Output.

37
00:02:20.035 --> 00:02:25.629
This file has the complete simulation
model of the flight overbooking problem.

38
00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:29.330
The uncertain variables
are in cells B14 and B17.

39
00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.380
B14 contains the psi Poisson
function that simulates a demand.

40
00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.280
B17 contains the psi binomial function
that simulates the number of passengers

41
00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.220
that show up for the flight.

42
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.570
At the moment, there is nothing that
links the way the values are simulated

43
00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.270
in both of these cells.

44
00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.720
Click on the Analytic Solver Platform tab.

45
00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.860
Click on the Correlations tool that is
located in the Simulation Model group.

46
00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.010
We want to create a new
correlation matrix.

47
00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.030
The right panel shows the two
uncertain variables in our model.

48
00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.060
Since we want to include
both of them in the matrix,

49
00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.370
we click on the double-arrow button
that is pointing to the right.

50
00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.520
The matrix is created with
a default correlation of 0.

51
00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.560
We change the correlation
value from 0 to 0.7.

52
00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.150
For the name, let's just type Demand and
show up rate.

53
00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.430
And for location,
enter e4 and click on Save.

54
00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:31.310
In the second video of this module,
we worked on the problem of finding

55
00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.860
an overbooking policy that
will result in a probability

56
00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:40.390
of a least 95% that the number of
bumped passengers is no more than two.

57
00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.690
We found that an overbooking of
nine accomplishes this goal.

58
00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.200
However, remember that our analysis

59
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.170
was done with a model without correlation
between demand and show-up rate.

60
00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.550
To see the results change now that we
have added our correlation matrix,

61
00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.030
let's do the following.

62
00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.880
First click on the simulation
bulb to turn it on.

63
00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.857
Also verify that the number of
simulation trials is set to 10,000.

64
00:04:06.857 --> 00:04:11.255
Then click on the green play
button to run the simulation.

65
00:04:11.255 --> 00:04:14.630
Double-click on B20 to open the empirical

66
00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:19.620
distribution of bumped passengers
that the simulation created.

67
00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:24.469
Set the lower marker at 2 and observe
that the probability of no more than

68
00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:27.424
two bumped passengers is not quite 95%.

69
00:04:27.424 --> 00:04:31.282
It's close, but
under the desired limit we can verify that

70
00:04:31.282 --> 00:04:35.590
without correlations
the probability exceeds 95%.

71
00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.710
This is done by clicking on
the Correlations tool and

72
00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.410
on checking the Use Correlations option.

73
00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.406
The probability changes to 95.88%.

74
00:04:45.406 --> 00:04:48.448
Therefore, to be sure that
the policy side is bad and

75
00:04:48.448 --> 00:04:53.153
taking into consideration that the two
sources of uncertainty are correlated,

76
00:04:53.153 --> 00:04:57.140
we need to consider a policy
with a lower overbooking limit.

77
00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:02.690
Let's use correlations again, by checking
that option in the Correlations tool.

78
00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.400
And then let's change
the overbooking limit to 8.

79
00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.200
The probability is now 97.44%,

80
00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:14.099
and the number of bumped passengers
does not exceed the desired limit of 2.

81
00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:18.312
Correlations between uncertain
variables are important and

82
00:05:18.312 --> 00:05:20.830
should be carefully examined.

83
00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.930
As we saw in our flight
overbooking example,

84
00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:28.795
adding a correlation between two sources
of uncertainty could change the results.

85
00:05:28.795 --> 00:05:33.238
My recommendation is that you always
include correlation analysis in

86
00:05:33.238 --> 00:05:36.109
the process of building
a simulation model.
