00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.680
To finish this module,

2
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.130
we're going to go back to something
that we discussed in the introduction.

3
00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:12.150
This has to do with the idea of creating
prediction models using average values.

4
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.950
It seems reasonable to believe that
if we use the average value for

5
00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.490
an uncertain input, we should get
the average value for an output.

6
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.820
While this might be true in some cases,
it is not universally true for all models.

7
00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.570
This phenomenon is known
as the Flaw of Averages.

8
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.920
Let's examine this idea on
a very well-known situation

9
00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.050
called the news vendor problem.

10
00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.740
The news vendor problem applies to
many practical situations where

11
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:46.120
a one time purchase decision must be
made in the face of uncertain demand.

12
00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.360
Department store managers must
make purchasing decisions for

13
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.870
seasonal items well in advance of
the beginning of the the season.

14
00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.750
For example, ski jackets
are typically ordered in the summer.

15
00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.790
The name of the problem comes from the
scenario where a news vendor needs to make

16
00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:09.070
a decision about the number of newspapers
to purchase to sell the next day.

17
00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.170
If she doesn't know enough,
then there is an opportunity cost, and

18
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:19.190
if she orders too many, then the leftover
papers go to the recycling bin.

19
00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.720
The input of a news vendor
model consists of demand,

20
00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.256
selling price, cost and salvage value.

21
00:01:26.256 --> 00:01:32.560
The quantity to purchase is a decision and
the output is the total profit.

22
00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.690
In this model, the selling price
is larger than the cost and

23
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.820
the cost is larger than the salvage value.

24
00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.860
Let's take a look at the news
vendor model in Excel.

25
00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.470
Locate and
open the Excel file News Vendor.

26
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.120
This workbook contains two models for

27
00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:55.310
a hypothetical ski apparel store that must
order ski jackets for the next season.

28
00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:01.260
The jackets cost $54 and
can be sold for $145.

29
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.560
The salvage value of a jacket is $45.

30
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.830
The historical average
demand is 80 jackets.

31
00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.794
Before examining the model
in the workbook,

32
00:02:10.794 --> 00:02:15.270
let's turn on the interactive
simulation of the ASP.

33
00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.070
Click on
the Analytic Solver Platform tab and

34
00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.500
then click on the simulate ball
in the Solve Action group.

35
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.190
Let's take a look at
the average volume model.

36
00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.940
Cell B10 contains a decision on
the number of jackets to purchase..

37
00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.280
This cell is colored yellow to
indicate that is a decision.

38
00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.375
In this case we are saying that
the manager is going to purchase

39
00:02:37.375 --> 00:02:40.025
the historical average of 80 jackets.

40
00:02:40.025 --> 00:02:44.755
The model assumes that the demand is going
to be the historical average demand.

41
00:02:44.755 --> 00:02:47.375
So there is an 80 in cell B11.

42
00:02:48.575 --> 00:02:51.635
This means that the model assumes
that all the jackets that

43
00:02:51.635 --> 00:02:56.060
were purchased will be sold and
there will be no surplus.

44
00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.020
The total revenue is
calculated in cell B14.

45
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.210
The cost is in B15, and the profit in B16.

46
00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:08.049
Since the model doesn't consider
any of the uncertainty,

47
00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:13.869
the average profit in cell B17 is
the same as the profit in cell B16.

48
00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:16.550
The estimated profit is $7,280.

49
00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:21.610
Now, let's take a look
at the simulation model.

50
00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.960
We're going to assume the store
would purchase the historical

51
00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.720
average of 80 jackets.

52
00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.120
The demand value in cell E11 is in green,

53
00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.080
the color that we have been using to
indicate that this is a uncertain value.

54
00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.440
If we double click on this cell, we can
see that we are making an assumption that

55
00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.580
the demand follows a Poisson distribution
with an average of 80 jackets.

56
00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.430
The rest of the formulas
to calculate the profit

57
00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.510
are the same as in
the average value model.

58
00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.998
The profit is the simulation output.

59
00:03:52.998 --> 00:03:57.950
So cell E16 includes
the psi output function.

60
00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:02.270
The average profit is calculated
using the PsiMean function.

61
00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:04.100
The difference between
the average model and

62
00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.540
the simulation model is that we have
added uncertainty in the demand.

63
00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.730
The uncertainty was modeled
using a Poisson distribution.

64
00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.300
If the assumption is correct that
the demand follows a Poisson distribution,

65
00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:20.170
which could be verified by analyzing
historical data, then the simulation

66
00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:25.270
model shows that the average value model
is over-estimating the expected profit.

67
00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.540
This tells us that using
an average value for

68
00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.570
an uncertain input,
the demand in this case,

69
00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.340
does not necessarily result in the correct
estimate for the average output value.

70
00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.900
What is happening here is that every
time the demand is larger than 80,

71
00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.965
the profit it stays at $7,280.

72
00:04:44.965 --> 00:04:49.505
However, when the demand is less than 80,
the profit drops because there

73
00:04:49.505 --> 00:04:53.745
will be some loss associated with
selling jackets at their salvage value.

74
00:04:53.745 --> 00:04:57.295
The average value model is
not able to capture this.

75
00:04:57.295 --> 00:05:01.280
To conclude, I hope that I
have been able to convince you

76
00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.710
of the benefits of simulation
as a predictive analytics tool

77
00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:11.380
that enables you to incorporate
uncertainty in decision making models.

78
00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:12.780
In this example,

79
00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:17.030
we show how average values might
result in misleading information.

80
00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:21.812
But this is just one of several important
insights produced by various types

81
00:05:21.812 --> 00:05:25.632
of analysis that we have
discussed throughout this module.
