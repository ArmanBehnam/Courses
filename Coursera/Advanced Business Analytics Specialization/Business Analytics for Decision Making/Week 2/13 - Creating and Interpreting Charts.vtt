1
00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.840
In the simulation model that we built for
the flight overbooking problem,

2
00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:10.030
we have been examining and interpreting
the frequency distribution chart

3
00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.190
that the simulator produces for
the output variables.

4
00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.090
We can use these charts to
estimate probabilities.

5
00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.760
For example, we have estimated that
the probability that the number of bumped

6
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.280
passengers does not
exceed a certain value.

7
00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.840
In this video we're going to
discuss three other charts

8
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.800
that the ASPC simulator produces.

9
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.050
The sensitivity chart,
the overlay chart and the trend chart.

10
00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.860
To do this we are going to
introduce a new a problem.

11
00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.290
We want to develop a simulation model for
a three year financial analysis

12
00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.420
of total profit based on
the following data and information.

13
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.260
Sales volume in the first year is
estimated to be 100,000 units and

14
00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.570
is projected to grow at a rate
that is normally distributed

15
00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.530
with a mean of 7% per year and
a standard deviation of 4%.

16
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.300
The selling price is $10 and the price
increase is normally distributed with

17
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.312
a mean of $0.50 and
standard deviation of $0.05 each year.

18
00:01:11.312 --> 00:01:18.165
Per-unit variable costs are $3 and
annual fixed costs are $200,000.

19
00:01:18.165 --> 00:01:23.570
Per-unit costs are expected to increase
by an amount normally distributed

20
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.940
with a mean of 5% per year and
a standard deviation of 2%.

21
00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.260
Fixed costs are expected to increase
following a normal distribution

22
00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.530
with a mean of 10% per year and
a standard deviation of 3%.

23
00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.200
We want to examine both
the annual profits and

24
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.500
net present value with
a discount rate of 7%.

25
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.470
Let's take a look at
a simulation model for

26
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.450
this problem, located in the Excel file,
financial analysis.

27
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.160
The workbook has five worksheets.

28
00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.300
One with the simulation model, and

29
00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.970
then one for each of the charts
that we're going to discuss.

30
00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.090
We will however,
build the charts using the ASB.

31
00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.139
We will work off
the Financial Analysis Model worksheet.

32
00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:11.771
The first table in the mold has all
the assumptions associated with cells,

33
00:02:11.771 --> 00:02:12.883
price and costs.

34
00:02:12.883 --> 00:02:16.173
The second table contains
the simulation model.

35
00:02:16.173 --> 00:02:18.961
All the values in
the first year are fixed.

36
00:02:18.961 --> 00:02:22.291
We have a sales volume of 100,000 units,

37
00:02:22.291 --> 00:02:27.875
a selling price of $10 and a revenue for
the first year of $1 million.

38
00:02:27.875 --> 00:02:32.290
Since the unit cost is $3 and
there's a fixed cost of $200,000,

39
00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.700
the total cost is $500,000.

40
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.550
This results in a profit of $500,000 for
the first year.

41
00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.870
The uncertainty in this model
is in all the green cells.

42
00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.400
There are four sources of uncertainty.

43
00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.860
The sales volume, the price,
and the variable and fix costs.

44
00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.080
The profit for each year and
the net present value or

45
00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.620
NPV, of all profits
are the outputs of them all.

46
00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:06.156
They are in cells B19, C19, D19, and B21.

47
00:03:06.156 --> 00:03:09.326
Click on the analytics of a platform and

48
00:03:09.326 --> 00:03:15.102
make sure that the number of
simulation trials is set to10,000.

49
00:03:15.102 --> 00:03:19.593
Now run the simulation by clicking on
the play button in the solver options and

50
00:03:19.593 --> 00:03:22.060
model specifications panel.

51
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.650
The first chart that we are going to
exam is a frequency chart for the MPV.

52
00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.360
Double click on the cell B21 and
the chart pops up.

53
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.500
We're going to get rid
of one the markers and

54
00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.800
set the remaining marker
to a value of 1.5 million.

55
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.390
We observe that the mall
estimates a 38.66%

56
00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:48.480
chance that the MPV for this investment
will be at least 1.5 million.

57
00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.880
Now, we want to know what
is driving this result.

58
00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.940
The mole has A to certain cells from
the four sources of uncertainty.

59
00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:02.540
These are the green cells in columns C and
D and rows 13 to 16.

60
00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.880
So which of these sources of uncertainty

61
00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.460
are most likely related to
the net present value problems?

62
00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:12.810
To answer this question we
go to the sensitivity tie.

63
00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.330
The chart shows the correlation of
uncertain variables with the output

64
00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:19.690
in this case the net present value.

65
00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.630
The chart shows the uncertain variables
by their correlation strength

66
00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.450
the most correlated variable
is at the top of the chart.

67
00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.800
And the least correlated
variable is at the bottom.

68
00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.270
This chart is sometimes called
tornado chart because of its shape.

69
00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.307
The blue bars indicate
positive correlation and

70
00:04:39.307 --> 00:04:42.278
the red bars indicate
negative correlations.

71
00:04:42.278 --> 00:04:49.238
The chart shows that cells C13 and
D13 are the most correlated with the NPV.

72
00:04:49.238 --> 00:04:54.095
These cells contain the cell's volume for
years two and three.

73
00:04:54.095 --> 00:04:59.035
What this tells us is that we should
try to obtain very good estimates for

74
00:04:59.035 --> 00:05:03.255
these numbers because they are the ones
that have the most influence

75
00:05:03.255 --> 00:05:04.990
on the net present value.

76
00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:09.550
Which is the key output that is going
to drive the decision of whether or

77
00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.060
not to invest in this opportunity.

78
00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:16.830
At the same time, the chart also indicates
that having a precise number for

79
00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.080
the selling price on year
three is not critical

80
00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.670
since it has very small
correlation with the NPV.

81
00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:28.980
Note how D14 appears at the bottom
of the sensitivity chart.

82
00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:31.990
Close this window and
examine the annual profits.

83
00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:36.110
In our model, the profit for
the first year is fixed.

84
00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:41.650
We're assuming that either there is no
certainty or the certainty is negligible.

85
00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:42.660
For the second and

86
00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:47.060
third year, we would like to compare
the distribution of profits.

87
00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:49.860
We can do this with an overlay chart.

88
00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:54.710
Click on Charts,
go to the Multiple Simulation Results, and

89
00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:56.550
choose Overlay Chart.

90
00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:00.610
In the output section,
choose C19 and D19, and

91
00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:04.470
click on the right arrow to move
them over to the right box.

92
00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:10.180
Recall that C19 and D19 are the profits
for years two and three.

93
00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.900
Click OK.
The distribution of profits

94
00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:17.790
in year two is shown in orange and
clearly it has a smaller mean

95
00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:21.990
than the distribution of profits in
year three, which is shown in blue.

96
00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:25.200
The chart also shows that
the variance of profits in year

97
00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.680
three is larger than
the variance in year two.

98
00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.400
This is reasonable given that there is

99
00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:35.750
more uncertainty in predicting
profits further in the future.

100
00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:40.370
Similar information can be obtained
with trend charts of annual profits.

101
00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:47.130
To build a trend chart, go to Charts,
Multiple Simulation Results and Trend.

102
00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:52.900
This time, choose B19, C19, and D19,
and move them over to the right.

103
00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:54.380
Click OK.

104
00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:59.050
The trend chart shows the mean values
of each of these variables and

105
00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:02.660
also the 75% and 95% band.

106
00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:03.980
Since the probability for

107
00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:08.780
the first year is fixed,
there are no bands around the mean value.

108
00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:12.860
The bands get wider in the future
because there is more uncertainty.

109
00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:16.830
The positive trend indicates that
the revenues are projected to

110
00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:22.320
grow faster than the costs, resulting
in higher profits from year to year.

111
00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:25.600
In this video we have seen
how charts are valuable

112
00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:29.350
tools to gain insights
from simulation results.

113
00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:32.270
The frequency chart helps us

114
00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:35.310
answer probability questions
related to an output.

115
00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:41.640
The sensitivity chart tells us which of
certain variables are most important.

116
00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:47.960
The overlay and trend charts gives
us insights on output variables.

117
00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:51.730
There are other charts that
we haven't covered here.

118
00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:54.570
But I encourage you to explore further

119
00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:59.830
either with the analytic solver
platform or using a similar software.

120
00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:02.615
Because most likely you
will find a chart for

121
00:08:02.615 --> 00:08:05.783
almost anything that you
would like to analyzed.
