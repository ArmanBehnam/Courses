00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.100
In our last video we built
a simulation by adding uncertainty

2
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.490
to a flight overbooking model.

3
00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:10.790
The model has two sources of uncertainty,
the demand and the show-up rate.

4
00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.570
Let's review the simulation
model that we created.

5
00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.220
So locate and open the Excel file,
Flight Overbooking Simulation.

6
00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.810
This workbook has two tabs.

7
00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.040
Click on the Overbooking Simulation tab.

8
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.910
The top table has the problem data and
the bottom table has a model.

9
00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.330
The model starts with a policy
decision of the overbooking limit.

10
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.028
This is the yellow cell, B13.

11
00:00:36.028 --> 00:00:41.730
The two green cells, B14 and B17,
are the ones with the certainty.

12
00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.820
In B14, we use the PsiPoisson function
from the analytic solver platform to

13
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.800
model the actual demand based on
the average demand of 150 passengers.

14
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:59.160
In cell B17, we use PsiBinomial
to model the show up process.

15
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.603
The binomial has two parameters,
the number of passengers that were booked,

16
00:01:04.603 --> 00:01:10.473
which is in cell B17, and the probability
that they show up, which is in cell B6.

17
00:01:10.473 --> 00:01:13.174
The model calculates
the number of no shows and

18
00:01:13.174 --> 00:01:17.330
then it determines how many passengers
will actually board the plane,

19
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.610
versus those who are bumped
to a later flight.

20
00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.720
The last part of the model calculates
revenue, cost and net revenue.

21
00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.730
If we recalculate
the spreadsheet by pressing F9,

22
00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.180
we can see that the values
in the green cells change.

23
00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.480
And that causes changes in both
the number of bumped passengers and

24
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.180
in the net revenue.

25
00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.450
We have highlighted these two cells
with light orange to indicate these

26
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.280
are outputs we're interested in tracking.

27
00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.670
Every time that we recalculate
the spreadsheet, 10,000 values for

28
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.360
the actual demand and
the ready to board cells are generated.

29
00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.820
Each set of values is what in
simulation is called a trial.

30
00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.130
As we mentioned in our previous video,

31
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.540
you can change the number of trials
in the tools group of the ASP tab.

32
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.080
We need to tell the simulator that
we would like to track the number

33
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.850
of bumped passengers and the net revenue.

34
00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:18.130
This is done by selecting cells B20 and
B24, and

35
00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:23.630
clicking on Results in the simulation
model group of the ASP tab.

36
00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.260
Once we do that, we can check
the cells to see what has changed.

37
00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.820
By clicking on cell B20,

38
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.310
we can see that there is an additional
function called PsiOutput.

39
00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.920
This function does not
modify the cell calculation.

40
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.090
It is there to tell the simulator that
the cell is a simulation output and

41
00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.200
it that it should collect data on
it when the simulation is run.

42
00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.020
The same function was added to cell B24.

43
00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.690
To run the simulation,
click on the Play button

44
00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:00.080
in the Model tab of the Solver options and
Model Specifications panel.

45
00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.909
To analyze results, double-click on B24.

46
00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:08.420
The simulator displays the empirical
distribution of net revenue that

47
00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.420
results from the simulation
of 10,000 trials.

48
00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.970
In addition to the empirical distribution,

49
00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.863
the software reports
the most common statistics.

50
00:03:17.863 --> 00:03:23.117
For example,
the simulation results show that

51
00:03:23.117 --> 00:03:28.634
the new revenue is estimated to be $45,196

52
00:03:28.634 --> 00:03:33.363
with a minimum value of $33,644 and

53
00:03:33.363 --> 00:03:37.453
a maximum value of $47,778.

54
00:03:37.453 --> 00:03:40.890
Estimating a range for
the net revenue is important.

55
00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.410
But what's interesting is being able to

56
00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.800
estimate the probability of
collecting some target net revenue.

57
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:52.050
For example, let's suppose that we were
interested in knowing the probability that

58
00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.920
the net revenue is $45,000 or more.

59
00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.270
We can do this using the markers
in the distribution chart.

60
00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:03.440
The markers are red dotted vertical lines.

61
00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.250
There is a lower and an upper marker.

62
00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.870
In this case, we only need the lower
marker, which we place on the value of 45.

63
00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:18.650
So remove the upper marker and enter 45
in the text box for the lower marker.

64
00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:24.491
We now see that the distribution
estimates that there is 63.83%

65
00:04:24.491 --> 00:04:30.050
probability that the net revenue
will be $45,000 or more.

66
00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.400
A similar analysis is possible on
the number of bumped passengers.

67
00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.004
Recall that the deterministic
model estimates that, on average,

68
00:04:39.004 --> 00:04:44.752
1 passenger will be bumped when setting
the overbooking limit to 13 passengers.

69
00:04:44.752 --> 00:04:49.449
If we double-click on cell B20,
we access the distribution of bumped

70
00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:52.530
passengers that results
from the simulation.

71
00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:59.490
The mean value of this distribution is 1,
as predicted by the deterministic model.

72
00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.180
However, now we have
additional information.

73
00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:07.090
For instance, if we set the lower
marker to a value of 2,

74
00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:13.294
we discover that according to our
simulation results there is a 24.55%

75
00:05:13.294 --> 00:05:18.360
chance that the number of
bumped passengers is 2 or more.

76
00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.640
We can also find that there is a low,

77
00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:25.690
over 10% chance that the number of
bumped passengers is 5 or more.

78
00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:31.280
These probabilities represent the risk of
the overbooking limit that we have chosen.

79
00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.820
The simulation can now be used
to find an overbooking limit

80
00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:37.870
that meets some desirable level of risk.

81
00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:43.350
For instance, suppose that the airline
would like at least a 95% chance

82
00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:48.030
that the number of bumped passengers
is less than or equal to 2.

83
00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:50.940
Which overbooking limit
would accomplish this?

84
00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:55.060
Let's use the interactive simulation
feature to find this out.

85
00:05:55.060 --> 00:06:01.380
In the Solve Actual group of the ASP tab,
click on the Simulation bulb.

86
00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:03.420
The bulb should turn yellow.

87
00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:08.380
We then click on B20 to open
the frequency distribution chart.

88
00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:12.766
We set the lower marker to 2, and
start decreasing the overbooking limit.

89
00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:17.260
Every time we enter a new number,
the spreadsheet is recalculated and

90
00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.550
the simulation is run.

91
00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:23.590
The frequency chart is updated at
the end of the simulation, and

92
00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:26.660
we can see the change in
the probability value

93
00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:30.630
that the number of bumped passengers
is less than or equal to 2.

94
00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:35.495
We keep decreasing the overbooking
limit until we find out that a limit of

95
00:06:35.495 --> 00:06:40.482
9 results in a probability
slightly higher than 95%.

96
00:06:40.482 --> 00:06:45.825
Now we have an overbooking limit for
this flight that meets the airline policy.

97
00:06:45.825 --> 00:06:50.365
In this video, we have added output
variables to our simulation model by

98
00:06:50.365 --> 00:06:54.665
using the PsiOutput function of
the Analytic Solver Platform.

99
00:06:54.665 --> 00:06:58.673
This function instructs the simulator
to collect data on the cell where

100
00:06:58.673 --> 00:07:01.000
the function is added.

101
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.330
The collected data generates an empirical
distribution of the output variable.

102
00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:09.460
This distribution helps us analyze risk,

103
00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:13.065
which we define as a probability
of some undesirable outcome.

104
00:07:13.065 --> 00:07:14.915
In our overbooking example,

105
00:07:14.915 --> 00:07:20.580
the undesirable outcome is either empty
seats or too many bumped passengers.

106
00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:23.190
The empirical distributions
of net revenue and

107
00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:28.830
bumped passengers can be used to asses
the risk of various overbooking limits.

108
00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:32.980
Finally, we show how to use
the interactive simulation feature

109
00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:34.680
in the context of searching for

110
00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:39.560
an overbooking limit that could
meet a particular airline policy.

111
00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:45.050
This example has shown the power of
simulation as a predictive analytics tool.

112
00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:48.953
We will explore additional features
in the next videos for this module.
