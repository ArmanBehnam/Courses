00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.580
In this video we're going to show how
to turn at the deterministic model

2
00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.280
into one that includes uncertainty.

3
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.490
We're going to do this
with a specific example.

4
00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.960
Overbooking is a common practice
in the airline industry.

5
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.720
On every flight there is a fraction
of passengers that do not show up.

6
00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.830
Anticipating this,
airlines overbook flights.

7
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.690
That is they sell more tickets
than the capacity of the aircraft,

8
00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:29.010
hoping that the right number of customers
will show up and the plane will fly full.

9
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.140
Overbooking increases
the probability of a full flight,

10
00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.320
maximizing revenue for the airline.

11
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.420
But if overbooking causes
passengers to be bumped,

12
00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.660
there is a cost to the airline in
both travel vouchers and good will.

13
00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.670
This of course reduces revenue.

14
00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.150
The secret to overbooking is
finding that magical number

15
00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:54.260
of extra reservations to avoid both
empty seats and bumped flyers.

16
00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.820
If every passenger that would miss
a flight for any reason at all will have

17
00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.360
to buy another ticket then empty seats
would not represent a loss of revenue.

18
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.240
However, this is not how things work.

19
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.290
Business travelers often pay higher
fares for refundable tickets.

20
00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.710
These travelers need flexibility of
changing plans at the last minute and

21
00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.530
the airline is happy to provide
this service for a price.

22
00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.190
But even travelers flying on
non-refundable tickets could miss a flight

23
00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.470
and be transferred to a later flight for
a fee or no fee at all.

24
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.840
Without overbooking the seats
of the no shows would be empty.

25
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.320
The loss of revenue of an empty
seat typically exceeds

26
00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.500
the actual cost of compensating
a bumped passenger.

27
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.800
But angering people is not good for
business, and this is why

28
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.510
the overbooking models include cost of
not only what the passenger receives,

29
00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:54.740
such as flight voucher, but
also an estimate of loss of goodwill.

30
00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.900
The problem of setting an overbooking
limit on a flight is complex.

31
00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:04.602
Airline analysts use models that consider
historical data, the mix of refundable and

32
00:02:04.602 --> 00:02:08.720
non-refundable tickets, and
the different airfare classes and levels.

33
00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.080
They even consider location
since a flight leaving Las Vegas

34
00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.760
might have more no shows
than one leaving Detroit.

35
00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.580
We're going to use a simplified version
of this problem to show how simulation is

36
00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.540
used to deal with the uncertainty
of passenger behavior and

37
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.710
delays in flight schedules.

38
00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:31.060
We're going to assume that we have been
charged with the task of establishing

39
00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.460
an overbooking limit for
a particular flight of a discount airline.

40
00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:40.100
The airline sells non-refundable
tickets only, but passengers that miss

41
00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.879
the flight can transfer to
another flight for a fee of $60.

42
00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:48.500
The flight uses an Airbus
319 with 134 seats.

43
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.305
Historically, the average demand for

44
00:02:51.305 --> 00:02:56.747
this flight has been 150 passengers and
the show up rate has been 92%.

45
00:02:56.747 --> 00:03:01.557
The price for the ticket is $314,
and we have considered

46
00:03:01.557 --> 00:03:06.571
that each passenger that is
bumped cost the airline $400.

47
00:03:06.571 --> 00:03:10.800
With this data, we will build a model to
calculate net revenue for this flight.

48
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.738
Before modeling this problem on
a spreadsheet, it is useful to understand

49
00:03:15.738 --> 00:03:20.610
the logic of how the overbooking limit
interacts with the no-show rate.

50
00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.730
This graphical representation
of the model shows that

51
00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.700
everything starts in the yellow
box with the decision to overbook.

52
00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.480
The overbooking limit is added
to the capacity of the aircraft

53
00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.800
to calculate the booking capacity.

54
00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.700
The number of passengers actually
booked is the minimum between

55
00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.060
the booking capacity and
the actually demand.

56
00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.600
This simply means that we cannot book
more passengers than the demand and

57
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.890
we're not allowed to book more
passengers than the booking capacity.

58
00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.670
For various reasons some booked
passengers do not show up, but

59
00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.220
most of them do and are ready to board.

60
00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.990
If the number of passengers
that are ready to board exceeds

61
00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:03.530
the capacity of the aircraft, then we have
to bump some passengers to a later flight.

62
00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:07.410
Now you can the connection
between an overbooking limit and

63
00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.580
the number of bumped passengers.

64
00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.630
Know that this connection
is not direct and

65
00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:17.170
other factors such as actual demand and
no-show rates play an important role.

66
00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:19.620
Now, let's create
the spreadsheet model for this.

67
00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:24.830
Locate and open the Excel file titled,
Flight Overbooking Simulation.

68
00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.380
The workbook has two spreadsheets.

69
00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.780
Let's start with the Overbooking Model.

70
00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.830
The top part of the spreadsheet contains
the data, which includes the average

71
00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:37.790
demand, the percentage of ticketed
passengers that actually show up for

72
00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.670
the flight, the capacity of the aircraft,
the ticket price,

73
00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:45.970
the transfer fee that no-shows must
pay to take another flight and

74
00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.265
the cost to the airline for
every bumped passenger.

75
00:04:49.265 --> 00:04:54.530
We use these values in the model that
estimates the number of bumped passengers

76
00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.030
and the net revenue.

77
00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:00.130
The model has one input,
two assumptions and two outputs.

78
00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:04.350
The input in the light gold
cell is the overbooking limit.

79
00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:06.810
The assumptions are in the green cells.

80
00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.300
One is the actual demand and

81
00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:14.200
the other is the number of passengers
that show up and are ready to board.

82
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.100
The outputs,

83
00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:20.710
in the pale orange cells, are the number
of bumped passengers and the net revenue.

84
00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:26.080
When the overbooking limit is set at 0 and
the demand is assumed to be 154

85
00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:32.820
passengers, the model predicts
a net revenue of $42,732.

86
00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.570
Naturally, there are no bumped passengers.

87
00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:38.580
Therefore, the overbooking cost is 0.

88
00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:44.070
We can see that the model also predicts
that there will be 11 no shows.

89
00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:47.330
This means that in order to
increase the net revenue,

90
00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:51.460
we could increase the overbooking
limit to at least 11 passengers.

91
00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:58.432
If we do that, the estimated net
revenue increases to $46,250.

92
00:05:58.432 --> 00:06:02.100
Note that the number
of no shows is now 12.

93
00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:07.340
So we can increase the overbooking limit
to 12 to match the number of no shows.

94
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:11.680
The revenue is now $46,564.

95
00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:16.650
Considering the assumptions that
the actual demand is 154 passengers and

96
00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:23.870
that the show up rate is 92%, an
overbooking of 12 maximizes net revenue.

97
00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:25.950
The model provides good insights.

98
00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:30.210
First of all, overbooking has
the potential for increasing revenue.

99
00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:34.650
However, the model does not take
advantage of additional historical data

100
00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:37.330
that is available for
this particular flight.

101
00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:40.950
We're only using average values for
historical records.

102
00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:45.460
Let's assume that using historical
data we conclude that the demand for

103
00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:51.560
this flight follows a Poisson distribution
with an average of 150 passengers.

104
00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:55.227
Let's also assume that through
a statistical analysis

105
00:06:55.227 --> 00:06:58.348
of the number of booked
passengers who show up,

106
00:06:58.348 --> 00:07:03.980
we discover that it follows a binomial
distribution with a success rate of 0.92.

107
00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:06.263
According to this distribution,

108
00:07:06.263 --> 00:07:12.170
there is an 85% chance that more than
134 passengers will show up at the gate.

109
00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:16.220
With this additional information
we can create a simulation model

110
00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:19.530
that is based on the deterministic
model that we just built.

111
00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:24.320
This is what we call adding
uncertainty to a spreadsheet model.

112
00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:26.580
Let's take a look at
the model with uncertainty.

113
00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:29.780
Click on the spreadsheet
named Overbooking Simulation.

114
00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:35.367
The green cells contain functions
from the Analytic Solver Platform,

115
00:07:35.367 --> 00:07:37.702
which we will refer to as ASP.

116
00:07:37.702 --> 00:07:41.846
If you don't have the ASP loaded on Excel,
watch the video title

117
00:07:41.846 --> 00:07:47.370
Introduction to the Analytic Solver
Platform first and then comeback here.

118
00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:52.320
The actual demand is now a random number
that follows a Poisson distribution.

119
00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:56.230
The number of passengers ready to
board is also a random number that

120
00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:58.160
follows a binomial distribution.

121
00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:03.690
All Analytic Solver Platform
functions start with the letters PSI.

122
00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:08.330
If we click on the play button,
we can see that the net revenue changes.

123
00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:12.000
We can also press on the F9 key to
recalculate the spreadsheet and

124
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.130
we will see that certain cells change
values and the net revenue changes.

125
00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:21.800
Each time we do this the software runs
the number of trials as specified in

126
00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:24.160
the tools section of the ribbon.

127
00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.130
I have mine set to 10,000 trials.

128
00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:32.030
Note that because this is assimilation
with an overbooking limit of 12,

129
00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:36.420
the number of bumped
passengers is not always 0.

130
00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:40.490
In this video we have used
a flight overbooking example

131
00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:44.930
to show how to turn a deterministic
model into a simulation model.

132
00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:48.890
We have learned how to add
uncertainty using the simulation

133
00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:51.900
functions in the Analytic Solver Platform.

134
00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:56.406
In the next video we will learn
how to collect simulation data and

135
00:08:56.406 --> 00:09:01.924
how to use this output to answer relevant
questions and gain useful insights.
