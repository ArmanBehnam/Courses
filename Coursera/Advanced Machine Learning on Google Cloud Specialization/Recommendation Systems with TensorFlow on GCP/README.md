In this course, you'll apply your knowledge of classification models and embeddings to build a ML pipeline that functions as a recommendation engine.

• Devise a content-based recommendation engine
• Implement a collaborative filtering recommendation engine
• Build a hybrid recommendation engine with user and content embeddings
