00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.340
Hello and welcome. I'm Philipp Maier,

2
00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.070
a course developer with Google Cloud Platform and this

3
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.210
is a brief tutorial on using Qwiklabs in this course.

4
00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.430
I'm about to show you the interactive hands-on labs platform

5
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.810
called Qwiklabs which is part of Google Cloud.

6
00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:19.320
Qwiklabs allows you to get practical hands-on experience with GCP and

7
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.900
provisions you with Google account credentials so you

8
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.190
can access that GCP console at no cost.

9
00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:29.735
The first step is to log into Coursera in an incognito window.

10
00:00:29.735 --> 00:00:31.190
Depending on your browser,

11
00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:35.235
it may also be called private browsing or InPrivate browsing.

12
00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:38.055
Logging into Coursera from a private window,

13
00:00:38.055 --> 00:00:39.890
ensures that you don't accidentally use

14
00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.535
your own Google account while accessing the Google Cloud Console.

15
00:00:43.535 --> 00:00:47.165
We don't want you to get any unexpected bills at the end of the month.

16
00:00:47.165 --> 00:00:51.710
Check out the links below this video for different browsers' support articles.

17
00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.085
Once logged into Coursera using any incognito window,

18
00:00:55.085 --> 00:00:59.250
return to your course and go to the lab activity page.

19
00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.765
So, if prompted, you want to accept

20
00:01:02.765 --> 00:01:06.660
the honor code and you might even have to enter your name.

21
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:12.740
Then you want to click the open tool button to open the lab in a new tab.

22
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.870
So, within the new tab, you can now click

23
00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:22.880
"start lab" and you want to wait until the "Lab Running" is displayed.

24
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:31.305
For each lab, you will have a timer in the top right with the remaining access time.

25
00:01:31.305 --> 00:01:34.795
Your lab will automatically end when the timer runs out.

26
00:01:34.795 --> 00:01:38.230
On the left, you have the connections detail.

27
00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.045
Click "Open Google Console"

28
00:01:41.045 --> 00:01:46.450
and then sign in with the username and password provided in the connections detail pane.

29
00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:52.495
So, I'm going to copy the username, paste that in here.

30
00:01:52.495 --> 00:01:55.940
I'm also going to take the password,

31
00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.890
paste it in here too.

32
00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.000
Now, Qwiklabs creates a new account for you each time you launch a lab.

33
00:02:02.695 --> 00:02:05.870
Therefore, you need to click through the initial account setup windows.

34
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.390
So, essentially I need to accept this.

35
00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.840
I don't need to add any recovery phone numbers,

36
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.550
so, I can just click DONE.

37
00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.735
I'm going to agree to the terms and services,

38
00:02:19.735 --> 00:02:22.360
and I don't need any emails.

39
00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.170
Now, I can verify that I'm using the Qwiklabs

40
00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.635
provided account and project within the GCP Console.

41
00:02:30.635 --> 00:02:34.530
So, up here, I see the project ID,

42
00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.390
and over here, I can see the username.

43
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.145
These are the same ones that I was provided with in the connections detail pane.

44
00:02:44.145 --> 00:02:48.045
You can also see that the timer is still running.

45
00:02:48.045 --> 00:02:53.010
Now, some labs track your work within the Qwiklabs-provided GCP project.

46
00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.400
If this is enabled, you'll see a score in

47
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.375
the top right corner of the Qwiklabs window as you can see right here.

48
00:02:59.375 --> 00:03:03.080
Your score increases as objectives are met and you can click on

49
00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.350
the score to view the individual steps to be scored.

50
00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.920
Now that I've completed the lab,

51
00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.785
I can see my score has been updated,

52
00:03:12.785 --> 00:03:15.870
and I'm ready to click End Lab.

53
00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.555
Once I click End Lab,

54
00:03:17.555 --> 00:03:23.100
the Qwiklabs-provided project and any resources within that project will be deleted.

55
00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.830
I can close the Qwiklabs lab page and

56
00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:31.025
my grade will be updated with my lab score in Coursera.

57
00:03:31.025 --> 00:03:32.810
That's it for this tutorial.

58
00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.500
Remember to launch Coursera in an incognito window,

59
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.220
and use the Qwiklabs-provided credentials to sign into the GCP Console.

60
00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.420
Good luck with the labs and enjoy the rest of this course.
