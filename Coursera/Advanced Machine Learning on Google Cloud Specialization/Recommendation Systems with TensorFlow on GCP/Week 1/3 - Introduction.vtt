00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.755
Hi. I'm Michael Munn,

2
00:00:01.755 --> 00:00:03.615
a machine learning engineer at Google.

3
00:00:03.615 --> 00:00:04.935
In the next few modules,

4
00:00:04.935 --> 00:00:07.155
we'll discuss recommendation engines.

5
00:00:07.155 --> 00:00:08.850
Recommendation engines are one of

6
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.550
the most successful and widely spread business use cases of

7
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.910
machine learning and power many of our favorite applications.

8
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.610
Think of applications like YouTube or Google Play,

9
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.380
and the suggested videos that are served to you when you use those products.

10
00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.315
Where do these videos come from?

11
00:00:23.315 --> 00:00:27.300
They're the results of recommender models working behind the scenes.

12
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.955
So, what exactly are recommendation engines?

13
00:00:29.955 --> 00:00:32.460
What do they do and how do they work?

14
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.880
Let's start with what recommendation engines do.

15
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.035
Well, they do a lot of things.

16
00:00:38.035 --> 00:00:41.400
Primarily, recommendation engines identify things that a user may

17
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.305
like based on products that they've interacted with in the past,

18
00:00:45.305 --> 00:00:49.175
but the video recommendations you see when you log into YouTube.

19
00:00:49.175 --> 00:00:53.554
For this user, the recommendations share a common theme generally programming,

20
00:00:53.554 --> 00:00:55.715
TensorFlow or machine learning.

21
00:00:55.715 --> 00:00:58.280
But they also suggest new items that

22
00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.710
the user might not have thought to search for themselves,

23
00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.800
like this video on quitting sugar.

24
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.379
It doesn't quite fit with the general theme of the other videos,

25
00:01:06.379 --> 00:01:08.950
yet it is still relevant for the user.

26
00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.140
This is especially useful for a product like YouTube,

27
00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.300
which has billions of videos in its catalog.

28
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.025
It's not feasible for a person to search through all of the content.

29
00:01:18.025 --> 00:01:21.020
Recommendation engines provide a way of surfacing

30
00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.965
new content that a user might like but didn't know to search for.

31
00:01:24.965 --> 00:01:28.470
Or consider the example of Smart Reply in Gmail.

32
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.810
From the merely possible responses to this email about project metrics,

33
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.575
we are recommended three short replies.

34
00:01:35.575 --> 00:01:40.820
Recommender systems also allow us to personalize a user's experience.

35
00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.200
By recording interactions such as likes or dislikes,

36
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.135
we can start to learn preferences unique to that user,

37
00:01:47.135 --> 00:01:53.310
and thus personalize future content and make personalized recommendations like this.

38
00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.150
Recommenders can suggest new products or

39
00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.025
apps relevant to the interests that that user has shared.

40
00:02:00.025 --> 00:02:02.870
Google Search is another great example of how

41
00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.675
recommendation engines can provide personalization.

42
00:02:05.675 --> 00:02:10.520
Your Google search queries take into account your location, your user history,

43
00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.160
account preferences, and previous searches to

44
00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.120
ensure that what you were served is most relevant to you, the user.

45
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.580
For example, typing "giants" into

46
00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.630
the search bar might yield different results depending on where you're located.

47
00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.880
If you're in New York, you might get a lot of

48
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.130
results for the New York Giants football team.

49
00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.770
However, the same search in San Francisco might

50
00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.510
return information about the San Francisco baseball team instead.

51
00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.490
Recommenders also help you to find content that goes together,

52
00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.460
content you are already looking for or that you didn't know you wanted.

53
00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:47.075
So, when you use Google search to find Keras TensorFlow tutorials,

54
00:02:47.075 --> 00:02:51.820
you're also recommended similar results based on what other people also search for.

55
00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.470
Or if you make it to the bottom of the page,

56
00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.210
you'll see related searches,

57
00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:00.025
in this case suggesting the best books on neural networks.

58
00:03:00.025 --> 00:03:03.845
This same kind of recommendation is working behind the scenes.

59
00:03:03.845 --> 00:03:06.320
When say you're buying a jump rope and you're

60
00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.970
recommended to buy a water bottle or a gym bag along with it.

61
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.240
These recommenders have learned that certain items go together and

62
00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.100
customers who bought one of these things are

63
00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.785
likely to benefit from buying the other as well.

64
00:03:18.785 --> 00:03:22.675
Recommender systems also provide a way to keep us engaged.

65
00:03:22.675 --> 00:03:24.540
When you watch a video on YouTube,

66
00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.990
you've probably noticed the banner just to the right of your video that

67
00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:29.915
contains a list of recommended videos that are up next.

68
00:03:29.915 --> 00:03:31.430
When your video finishes,

69
00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:32.795
these new ones will play,

70
00:03:32.795 --> 00:03:35.545
and we'd like them to be interesting and useful for you.

71
00:03:35.545 --> 00:03:37.420
This serves two purposes,

72
00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:42.125
it keeps the user happy and interested and also keeps them engaged with the product.

73
00:03:42.125 --> 00:03:44.150
Even outside the realm of products,

74
00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.590
recommender systems have become

75
00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.865
an important way for businesses to interact with their customers.

76
00:03:48.865 --> 00:03:51.655
For example, when you contact a call center,

77
00:03:51.655 --> 00:03:53.870
our recommendation engine can help ensure that

78
00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.540
your query is directed to the appropriate division,

79
00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.220
which improves their operations and keeps customers happy.

80
00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:01.915
In all of these examples,

81
00:04:01.915 --> 00:04:04.130
recommender systems provide benefit both for

82
00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:07.460
the people who provide them and the people who use them.

83
00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:11.630
For users, they help us explore and understand the item space,

84
00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.460
whether that is by helping us find

85
00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:17.555
related content or helping us explore new items entirely.

86
00:04:17.555 --> 00:04:20.435
They also improve decision-making by decreasing

87
00:04:20.435 --> 00:04:22.835
a potentially massive item space to

88
00:04:22.835 --> 00:04:26.935
only those few items relevant to the user and much more.

89
00:04:26.935 --> 00:04:29.575
From the recommender provider perspective,

90
00:04:29.575 --> 00:04:32.615
they increase user satisfaction and engagement,

91
00:04:32.615 --> 00:04:35.725
which leads to deeper customer loyalty and trust.

92
00:04:35.725 --> 00:04:38.150
They also allow providers to learn more about

93
00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.730
their customers by examining their interactions with

94
00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.600
the recommended suggestions or even change user behavior and

95
00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:49.300
drive demands towards less popular but still relevant items for the user.

96
00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:54.650
In short, recommender systems provide a way to model people's preferences and behaviors,

97
00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.080
which allows providers to reach the right customer

98
00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.040
efficiently and effectively with the right message at the right time.

99
00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.885
In the upcoming modules,

100
00:05:02.885 --> 00:05:05.510
we'll cover some of the details of recommendation engines.

101
00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:07.520
We'll discuss different types of

102
00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.775
popularly used recommendation engines

103
00:05:09.775 --> 00:05:12.625
including content-based and collaborative filtering,

104
00:05:12.625 --> 00:05:16.070
knowledge based recommenders, and deep learning techniques.

105
00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:19.715
We'll do a deep dive into some of these approaches in later modules.

106
00:05:19.715 --> 00:05:22.340
We'll also see how you can design and build

107
00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.700
your own recommendation engine following each of these methods.

108
00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.430
We'll end this module by discussing some of

109
00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.685
the common pitfalls that arise when developing recommender systems,

110
00:05:31.685 --> 00:05:33.390
and how they can be addressed.
