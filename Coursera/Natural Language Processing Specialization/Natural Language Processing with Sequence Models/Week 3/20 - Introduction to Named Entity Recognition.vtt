00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.955
Welcome back. In this video,

2
00:00:02.955 --> 00:00:05.684
I will tell you about
named entity recognition,

3
00:00:05.684 --> 00:00:07.560
NER for short.

4
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.465
It's an important problem and

5
00:00:09.465 --> 00:00:13.440
many NLP systems make
use of NER components.

6
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.660
Let me tell you what it is.

7
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.850
Named entity recognition is

8
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.620
a fast and efficient way to scan

9
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.750
text for certain
kinds of information.

10
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.205
NER systems locate and extract
named entities from texts.

11
00:00:26.205 --> 00:00:28.500
Named entities can
be anything from

12
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.975
a place to an organization,

13
00:00:30.975 --> 00:00:32.560
to a person's name.

14
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.060
They can even be times and dates.

15
00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.780
Let's discuss labels
used by NER systems in

16
00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.790
a little more detail as they

17
00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.465
relate to your programming
assignments this week.

18
00:00:43.465 --> 00:00:45.980
Some possible classes
you might run across

19
00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.774
include geographical
entities like Thailand,

20
00:00:49.774 --> 00:00:51.995
organizations like Google,

21
00:00:51.995 --> 00:00:55.040
or geopolitical
entities like Indian.

22
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.350
A few more classes
you might encounter

23
00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.010
include time indicators
like the month of December,

24
00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.910
artifacts like this
ancient Egyptian statue,

25
00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.565
or a person such as Barack Obama.

26
00:01:07.565 --> 00:01:10.130
As you can see,
named entities can

27
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.920
capture an identify
all kinds of things.

28
00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.169
Say you have the
following sentence.

29
00:01:15.169 --> 00:01:18.365
Sharon flew to Miami last Friday.

30
00:01:18.365 --> 00:01:21.100
Named entity recognition
system would

31
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.355
extract and classifies
Sharon as a personal name,

32
00:01:24.355 --> 00:01:27.235
Miami as a geographical entity,

33
00:01:27.235 --> 00:01:30.375
and Friday as a time indicator.

34
00:01:30.375 --> 00:01:32.500
You'll notice that here

35
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.830
B dash denotes an
entity of some kind,

36
00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:40.990
and all the other words are
classified O for filler word.

37
00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.330
You can probably already see how

38
00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.240
useful this is for
content classification.

39
00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.490
In a scenario where
you need to search

40
00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.935
large amounts of texts
for certain words,

41
00:01:50.935 --> 00:01:52.960
say Manhattan and Brooklyn,

42
00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.080
or Toyota and Subaru,

43
00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.020
this becomes handy very quickly.

44
00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.470
Here are some
real-world applications

45
00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.735
of named entity
recognition systems.

46
00:02:02.735 --> 00:02:04.910
I mentioned their ability to scan

47
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:06.980
documents for certain
things quickly.

48
00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.140
So just imagine how NERs

49
00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.810
can optimize search
engine efficiency.

50
00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.530
In this case, the NER
models scans millions of

51
00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.450
websites once and stores

52
00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.630
the entities as identified
in the process.

53
00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.060
Then the tags from
your search query are

54
00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.765
simply matched against
the website tags.

55
00:02:25.765 --> 00:02:27.830
The same concept extends,

56
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.430
so making recommendations where
the tags might instead be

57
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.200
extracted from your history

58
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.615
and compared to similar
user histories.

59
00:02:35.615 --> 00:02:38.810
In order to recommend things
you might want to check out.

60
00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.300
This also applies to
matching customers to

61
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.700
an appropriate customer
service agents.

62
00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.790
This works similarly to a
phone tree where you would be

63
00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.940
prompted to provide some
information about your request.

64
00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.680
If you're using an app to

65
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.215
communicate with your
car insurance company,

66
00:02:54.215 --> 00:02:56.000
you might provide some spoken or

67
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.135
typed information such as,

68
00:02:58.135 --> 00:03:00.770
"I need to add another
vehicle" or "My

69
00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.620
car was destroyed by a
giant flying squirrel."

70
00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:04.940
You then be matched to

71
00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.640
the appropriate
agents accordingly.

72
00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.210
Another interesting use
case is automatic trading.

73
00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:12.860
For example, you could imagine

74
00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.690
building a web scraper to get

75
00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.250
news articles of the names of

76
00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.565
certain CEOs, stocks,
or cryptocurrencies.

77
00:03:19.565 --> 00:03:21.950
Then feeding those articles into

78
00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.900
a sentiment classification system

79
00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.169
and making your
trades accordingly.

80
00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:28.715
NER systems have
many applications

81
00:03:28.715 --> 00:03:30.215
in the field of deep-learning.

82
00:03:30.215 --> 00:03:33.875
I just gave you one potential
moneymaker for free.

83
00:03:33.875 --> 00:03:37.775
Now you know what named
entity recognition is.

84
00:03:37.775 --> 00:03:40.070
I think it's really
interesting to

85
00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.455
see the many places
where it's used.

86
00:03:42.455 --> 00:03:44.480
In the next video
you will implement

87
00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.880
your own NER system
using colorst apps.
