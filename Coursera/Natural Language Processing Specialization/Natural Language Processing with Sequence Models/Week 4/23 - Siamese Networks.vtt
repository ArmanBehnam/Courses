00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:01.660
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:04.460
In this video you're going to
learn about a special type of

3
00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.450
neural network known as
the Siamese network.

4
00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.280
It is a neural network made up
of two identical neural networks

5
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.180
which are merged at the end.

6
00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.830
This type of architecture has
many applications and NLP.

7
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.380
And in this video, you'll see the
different examples where you can use it.

8
00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.770
Consider the following question.

9
00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:25.220
How old are you?

10
00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.370
And what is your age?

11
00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:30.920
You can see that these questions
don't have any words in common.

12
00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.160
However, they both mean the same thing.

13
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.020
On the other hand,

14
00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.050
if you were to look at the following
questions, where are you from?

15
00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.970
And where are you going?

16
00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.990
You can see that the first
three words are the same.

17
00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:49.230
However, the last word completely
changes the meaning of each question.

18
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.760
This example shows that comparing meaning
is not as simple as just comparing words.

19
00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.330
Coming up, you're going to see
how you can use Siamese networks

20
00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.270
to compare the meaning of word sequences,
and

21
00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:07.700
identify question duplicates,
which is a very important NLP application

22
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.765
at the core of platforms like
Stack Overflow or Quora.

23
00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.860
Before these platforms allow you to post
a new question, they want to be sure that

24
00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.430
your question hasn't already
been posted by somebody else.

25
00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.270
Now take this sentence,
I'm happy because I'm learning, and

26
00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.480
consider it in the context of sentiment
analysis and binary classification.

27
00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.460
Now in training a classification
algorithm, you discover what features

28
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.390
give the statement a positive or
negative sentiment.

29
00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.470
With Siamese networks you'll be aiming to
identify what's makes two input similar,

30
00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.210
and what makes them different.

31
00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.440
Take a look at these two questions.

32
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:46.254
What is your age?

33
00:01:46.254 --> 00:01:47.470
And how old are you?

34
00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.400
When you build a Siamese model, you're
trying to identify the difference or

35
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.600
the similarity between
these two questions.

36
00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.612
You do this by computing
a single similarity score,

37
00:01:58.612 --> 00:02:02.111
representing the relationship
between the two questions.

38
00:02:02.111 --> 00:02:05.211
And based on that score when
compared against a threshold,

39
00:02:05.211 --> 00:02:08.380
you can predict whether these
two are the same or different.

40
00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:15.190
Siamese networks have many applications
in NLP, you can use them to authenticate

41
00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.300
handwritten checks by determining whether
two signatures are the same or not.

42
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.860
You can use them to identify question
duplicates on platforms like Quora or

43
00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:25.670
Stack Overflow.

44
00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.350
And you can use them in
search engine queries

45
00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:34.490
to predict whether a new query is similar
to the one that was already executed.

46
00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.510
These are just a few examples, but

47
00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.610
there are many more applications
of Siamese networks in NLP.

48
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.425
You can use Siamese networks in
many types of NLP applications.

49
00:02:45.425 --> 00:02:46.230
In the next video,

50
00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.220
I'll walk you through the architecture
that is used in this type of model.

51
00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.250
And I'll show you how you
can use it in a text.

52
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.520
I'll see you in the next video.
