00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.565
To create a neural
network out of layers,

2
00:00:02.565 --> 00:00:04.395
you need to put them together.

3
00:00:04.395 --> 00:00:06.420
In a deep network,
you run them one

4
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.385
after the other in
a sequential way.

5
00:00:08.385 --> 00:00:10.485
Let me show you how
you can do this.

6
00:00:10.485 --> 00:00:13.380
Previously, you saw
how to define layers,

7
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.720
and I showed you how the
dense and ReLU layers

8
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.630
performed single steps
of forward propagation.

9
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.225
Now, I'll show you how to define

10
00:00:21.225 --> 00:00:23.220
a serial neural network as

11
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.325
a composition of layers thats
operates in a sequence.

12
00:00:26.325 --> 00:00:28.980
Imagine, a basic neural
network like this one.

13
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.970
You have some dense layers
and activation layers,

14
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.770
and the sequential
arrangements of

15
00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.600
those layers is done in tracts,

16
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.730
when you define a serial layer.

17
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.630
You could think of this
new serial layer as

18
00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.370
your whole neural network
model in one layer.

19
00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.015
Let's summarize what
you just learned.

20
00:00:48.015 --> 00:00:50.450
A serial layer is a composition

21
00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.670
of sublayers that operates

22
00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.745
sequentially to perform
the forward computation

23
00:00:55.745 --> 00:00:57.400
of your entire model.

24
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.510
Coming up, I'll introduce

25
00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.000
some additional layers and
the training procedure.
