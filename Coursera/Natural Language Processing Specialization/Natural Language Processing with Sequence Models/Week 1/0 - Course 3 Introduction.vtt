00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.179
Welcome to the third course
of this specialization.

2
00:00:04.179 --> 00:00:09.509
This course is called natural language
processing with sequence models.

3
00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:13.563
In this course, here are some
of the things you get to build.

4
00:00:13.563 --> 00:00:19.616
First, you take sentiment analysis to
the next level with deep neural networks.

5
00:00:19.616 --> 00:00:25.580
You also build a language generator
using RNNs or recurrent neural networks.

6
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.247
You apply LSTM units.

7
00:00:27.247 --> 00:00:30.229
LSTM stands for long short term memory.

8
00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:34.864
You apply LCM units to the problem
of named entity recognition.

9
00:00:34.864 --> 00:00:39.975
And, finally you use Siamese networks to
identify duplicate questions like say

10
00:00:39.975 --> 00:00:45.326
if there's an online discussion forum and
different people are asking questions.

11
00:00:45.326 --> 00:00:50.451
Can you figure out if two different people
ask essentially the same question but

12
00:00:50.451 --> 00:00:52.149
with different wording?

13
00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:56.975
With the skills you develop in this
course, you'll be able to build powerful

14
00:00:56.975 --> 00:01:01.072
NLP systems to solve problems
across a wide range of industries.

15
00:01:01.072 --> 00:01:05.554
It is my pleasure to welcome Lukasz and
Younes as your instructors for

16
00:01:05.554 --> 00:01:10.125
this course and they're thrilled to
dive into these topics with you.

17
00:01:10.125 --> 00:01:14.256
Younes, perhaps you could say
a bit more about the applications

18
00:01:14.256 --> 00:01:16.947
that learners will build in this course.

19
00:01:16.947 --> 00:01:17.789
>> Sure thing.

20
00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:19.650
Thanks, Andrew.

21
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.500
Well, I'd like to start by saying
that in the first two courses of

22
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.262
the specialization, you build a powerful
foundation that will provide you with

23
00:01:28.262 --> 00:01:32.761
both the context and the fundamental
skills you need to tackle this course.

24
00:01:32.761 --> 00:01:37.079
For example, you've already done
sentiment analysis in course one with

25
00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.105
a simple naive Bayes classifier.

26
00:01:39.105 --> 00:01:43.867
But now, you will leverage the power of
deep neural networks to build a much more

27
00:01:43.867 --> 00:01:46.372
robust sentiment analysis classifier.

28
00:01:46.372 --> 00:01:50.849
You've also seen how to do things like
predict the next word in a sequence,

29
00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:55.410
using relatively simple n-gram
language models in course two.

30
00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:00.297
In this course, you'll create an advanced
model using recurrent neural networks

31
00:02:00.297 --> 00:02:01.421
to generate text.

32
00:02:01.421 --> 00:02:05.997
You can think of this course as taking
the step from foundational skills into

33
00:02:05.997 --> 00:02:08.430
building real world NLP applications.

34
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:09.581
>> Very cool, Younes.

35
00:02:09.581 --> 00:02:13.250
I think that's a great
way to think about it.

36
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.153
Lukasz, maybe you could say a bit more
about the applications learners will

37
00:02:18.153 --> 00:02:19.081
get to build.

38
00:02:19.081 --> 00:02:21.540
>> Sure, thank you, Andrew.

39
00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.590
Well, as you saw in the first course,

40
00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.741
the problem of sentiment
analysis is a really tricky one.

41
00:02:26.741 --> 00:02:30.904
But in many applications you want to
determine the sentiment of a sentence.

42
00:02:30.904 --> 00:02:33.569
So it's a really good
problem to work on as well.

43
00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:37.568
With language modeling, which you'll
tackle in week two of this course,

44
00:02:37.568 --> 00:02:40.177
the problems you can solve
are almost infinite.

45
00:02:40.177 --> 00:02:43.895
From translation to autocomplete
to generating text from scratch.

46
00:02:43.895 --> 00:02:48.465
In week three of this course, you'll work
on named entity recognition, which is

47
00:02:48.465 --> 00:02:53.056
the problem of separating named entities
in sentences, like people and places.

48
00:02:53.056 --> 00:02:56.245
This is a building block of
many important NLP systems.

49
00:02:56.245 --> 00:03:00.605
Finally, in week four you will tackle
the problem of identifying duplicates.

50
00:03:00.605 --> 00:03:04.319
The question whether two pieces of
texts are duplicates of each other

51
00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.776
might not sound very interesting at first,
but as you will see,

52
00:03:07.776 --> 00:03:11.426
it's actually core building block
of things like online forums and

53
00:03:11.426 --> 00:03:14.203
search engines and
we'll show you how to solve it.

54
00:03:14.203 --> 00:03:17.458
So we're really excited to show
you these applications and

55
00:03:17.458 --> 00:03:19.474
bring your skills to the next level.

56
00:03:19.474 --> 00:03:21.980
>> Thank you Lukasz and thank you Younes.

57
00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.167
This is going to be an exciting course,
so let's get started.

58
00:03:26.167 --> 00:03:26.957
>> Good luck.

59
00:03:26.957 --> 00:03:27.670
>> Have fun.
