00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.465
Welcome. This week, I
will go over autocorrect.

2
00:00:03.465 --> 00:00:05.190
It is how your
misspelled words are

3
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.475
corrected automatically
to the right ones.

4
00:00:07.475 --> 00:00:08.670
You know it already from

5
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.410
your e-mail client on your phone.

6
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.270
Let me show you how it works.

7
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:14.760
So let's go over this
week's learning objectives.

8
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.595
You'll learn about
autocorrect conceptually.

9
00:00:17.595 --> 00:00:19.170
You've most likely used it in

10
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.045
your phone or word processor.

11
00:00:21.045 --> 00:00:23.505
But what is autocorrect exactly?

12
00:00:23.505 --> 00:00:25.200
It can mean slightly
different things

13
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.799
depending on the context.

14
00:00:26.799 --> 00:00:29.250
You will learn about
the nuances this week.

15
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.680
You'll practice building

16
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.675
the model to perform autocorrect.

17
00:00:32.675 --> 00:00:34.970
You'll learn each step
in autocorrect and

18
00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.940
key concepts to prepare you
for the coding assignments.

19
00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.300
When performing autocorrect,
you will want to be able to

20
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.425
quantify how far apart or
different two strings are,

21
00:00:45.425 --> 00:00:47.120
and ask how many letters you can

22
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.385
change to go from one
string to another.

23
00:00:49.385 --> 00:00:50.840
To do this, you will learn to

24
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.835
measure minimum edit distance.

25
00:00:52.835 --> 00:00:54.590
You will implement a really

26
00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.480
interesting algorithmic
approach for

27
00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.355
solving the minimum edit distance

28
00:00:58.355 --> 00:01:00.590
called dynamic programming.

29
00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.255
At the end of the lecture,

30
00:01:02.255 --> 00:01:04.310
you'll demonstrate your
new skills and put

31
00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:07.770
all these techniques to work
in this week's assignments.
