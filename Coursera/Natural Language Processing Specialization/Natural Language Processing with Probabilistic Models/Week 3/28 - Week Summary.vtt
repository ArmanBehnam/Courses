00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.475
Let's take a moment to reflect on

2
00:00:02.475 --> 00:00:04.500
everything you
accomplished this week.

3
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.170
You began with the
definition of N-Grams and

4
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.865
how to calculate their
probabilities from a corpus.

5
00:00:09.865 --> 00:00:12.720
Then you combined the
N-Gram probabilities to

6
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.629
approximate the
probability of a sentence.

7
00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:18.360
Organizing information
about all N-Grams in

8
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.705
the corpus helped you to
build a language model,

9
00:00:21.705 --> 00:00:25.875
a tool that estimates the
probability of any sentence.

10
00:00:25.875 --> 00:00:27.990
You also resolved
situations where

11
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.485
information about some parts
of the sentence was missing.

12
00:00:31.485 --> 00:00:35.669
You handled this in several
ways: by transforming

13
00:00:35.669 --> 00:00:37.420
your model to deal with outs of

14
00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.435
vocabulary words using
special UNK word,

15
00:00:40.435 --> 00:00:42.770
and by applying
several methods to

16
00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.115
handle missing N-Grams
in the corpus,

17
00:00:45.115 --> 00:00:48.225
such as smoothing, backoff,
and interpolation.

18
00:00:48.225 --> 00:00:51.560
Finally, you acquired a
tool to help you choose

19
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.850
the best language model for

20
00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.470
your task, the perplexity metric.

21
00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.815
Now you're ready to take on

22
00:00:57.815 --> 00:01:00.965
your assignment,
sentence autocomplete.

23
00:01:00.965 --> 00:01:02.420
You've done amazing work

24
00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.800
this week and I hope
you've enjoyed it.

25
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.000
Best of luck on your assignment
and I'll see you later.
