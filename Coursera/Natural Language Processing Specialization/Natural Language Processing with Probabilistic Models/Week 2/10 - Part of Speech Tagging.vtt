00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.385
Welcome to the second
week of this course.

2
00:00:02.385 --> 00:00:04.020
In this video, you're
going to learn

3
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:05.685
about parts of speech tagging.

4
00:00:05.685 --> 00:00:06.990
Specifically, you will see

5
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.720
the difference applications
that it is used for.

6
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.730
You will also learn
how to compute

7
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.475
the accuracy of a part
of speech tagger.

8
00:00:14.475 --> 00:00:18.420
First, I'll go over what
parts of speech tagging is.

9
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.710
Then I'll show you how to
use so-called Markov chains,

10
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.450
and hidden Markov
models to create

11
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.060
parts of speech tags
for your text corpus.

12
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.854
Next, I will introduce
the Viterbi algorithm,

13
00:00:30.854 --> 00:00:34.290
and demonstrates how it's
used in hidden Markov models.

14
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.140
You'll get to try this on
your own with an example.

15
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.640
You're going to apply all of

16
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.055
these skills in this
weeks coding assignments.

17
00:00:41.055 --> 00:00:43.850
It's a big week, so
let's get started.

18
00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.160
Part-of-speech refers
to the category of

19
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.845
words or the lexical
terms in the language.

20
00:00:48.845 --> 00:00:51.050
Examples of these
lexical terms in

21
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.055
the English language would
be noun, verb, adjective,

22
00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:56.495
adverb, pronoun,

23
00:00:56.495 --> 00:00:59.595
preposition, although
there are many others,

24
00:00:59.595 --> 00:01:01.565
let's take a look
at this sentence.

25
00:01:01.565 --> 00:01:03.410
Why not learn something?

26
00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.840
Rising out, the names of
these terms can quickly

27
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.240
become cumbersome
drink texts Analysis.

28
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.635
So you're going to use

29
00:01:09.635 --> 00:01:11.600
a short representation called

30
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.315
tags to represent
these categories.

31
00:01:14.315 --> 00:01:17.480
The process of assigning
these tags to the words of

32
00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.759
a sentence or your corpus

33
00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:22.490
is referred to as parts
of speech tagging,

34
00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.310
or POS tagging for short,

35
00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.500
because POS tags describe

36
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.150
the characteristics structure of

37
00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.610
lexical terms in a
sentence or text.

38
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.005
You can use them to make
assumptions about semantics.

39
00:01:35.005 --> 00:01:38.660
They're used for identifying
named entities too and

40
00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.860
a sentence such as the Eiffel
Tower is located in Paris.

41
00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.480
Eiffel Tower in Paris
are both named entities.

42
00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.875
Tags are also used for
co-reference resolution.

43
00:01:49.875 --> 00:01:51.810
If you have the two sentences,

44
00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.490
the Eiffel tower is
located in Paris,

45
00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.770
it is 324 meters high.

46
00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.235
You can use parts of speech
sagging to infer that

47
00:02:01.235 --> 00:02:05.520
it's refers in this context
to the Eiffel Tower.

48
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.439
Another application is
speech recognition,

49
00:02:09.439 --> 00:02:12.875
where you use parts of
speech tags to check

50
00:02:12.875 --> 00:02:16.570
if a sequence of words has
a high probability or not.

51
00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.620
You know now the
difference applications

52
00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.300
of parts of speech sagging.

53
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.950
In the next video,
you're going to learn

54
00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.080
about Markov chains
and you'll see how

55
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.850
you can use them to decode

56
00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.309
the parts of speech of
a certain sentence.
