00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.710
Welcome and this week you're going to
learn about supervised machine learning

2
00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.490
and specifically you're going to
learn about logistic regression.

3
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.920
In order for you to implement logistic
regression, you need to take a few steps.

4
00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.780
In this video you will learn
about the steps required

5
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.010
in order to implement this algorithm,
so let's take a look.

6
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:26.320
In supervised machine learning you have
input features X and a set of labels Y.

7
00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.350
Now to make sure you're getting the most
accurate predictions based on your data,

8
00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:35.340
your goal is to minimize your error
rates or cost as much as possible.

9
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.630
And to do this, you're going to run
your prediction function which takes in

10
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:45.350
parameters data to map your
features to output labels Y hat.

11
00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.510
Now the best mapping from features to
labels is achieved when the difference

12
00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:57.480
between the expected values Y and
the predicted values Y hat is minimized.

13
00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.100
Which the cost function does by
comparing how closely your output Y hat

14
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.240
is to your label Y.

15
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.810
Then you can update your parameters and

16
00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.690
repeat the whole process
until your cost is minimized.

17
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.850
So let's take a look at the supervised
machine learning classification task

18
00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.160
of sentiment analysis.

19
00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:24.600
In this example you have the tweet, let's
say, I'm happy because I'm learning NLP.

20
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.230
And the objective in this task is to
predict whether a tweeta has a positive or

21
00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.020
a negative sentiment.

22
00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.830
And you'll do this by
starting with a training set

23
00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.140
where tweets with a positive
sentiment have a label of one, and

24
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.120
the tweets with a negative
sentiment have a label of zero.

25
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.090
For this task you will be using
your logistic regression classifier

26
00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.740
which assigns its observations
to two distinct classes.

27
00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.700
Next up I'll show you how to do this.

28
00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.770
So to get started building
a logistic regression classifier

29
00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.230
that's capable of predicting
sentiments of an arbitrary tweet.

30
00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:06.273
You will first process the raw
tweets in your training sets and

31
00:02:06.273 --> 00:02:08.070
extract useful features.

32
00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.650
Then you will train your
logistic regression classifier

33
00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.830
while minimizing the cost.

34
00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.710
And finally you'll be able
to make your predictions.

35
00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.310
So in this video you learned
about the steps required for

36
00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:22.622
you to classify a tweet.

37
00:02:22.622 --> 00:02:27.900
Given the tweet, you should classify
it to either be positive or negative.

38
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.612
In order for you to do so,
you first have to extract the features.

39
00:02:31.612 --> 00:02:33.732
Then you have to train your model.

40
00:02:33.732 --> 00:02:38.052
And then you have to classify the tweet
based off your trained model.

41
00:02:38.052 --> 00:02:41.972
In the next video, you're going to
learn how to extract these features.

42
00:02:41.972 --> 00:02:43.442
So let's take a look at
how you can do that.
