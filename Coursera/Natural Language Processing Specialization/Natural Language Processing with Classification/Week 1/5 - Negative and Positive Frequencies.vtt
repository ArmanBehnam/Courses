00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.920
We'll now learn to
generates counts,

2
00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.840
which you can then
use as features into

3
00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.925
your logistic
regression classifier.

4
00:00:05.925 --> 00:00:08.010
Specifically, given a word,

5
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.975
you want to keep track
of the number of times,

6
00:00:09.975 --> 00:00:12.270
that's where it shows up
as the positive class.

7
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:13.680
Given another word you want

8
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:14.790
to keep track of the number of

9
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.015
times that word showed up
in the negative class.

10
00:00:18.015 --> 00:00:19.785
Using both those counts,

11
00:00:19.785 --> 00:00:22.380
you can then extract
features and use

12
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.365
those features into your
logistic regression classifier.

13
00:00:25.365 --> 00:00:27.945
So let's take a look at
how you can do that.

14
00:00:27.945 --> 00:00:29.700
It is helpful to first

15
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.680
imagine how these two
classes would look.

16
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.630
Here for instance, you could

17
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.300
have a corpus consisting
of four tweets.

18
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.295
Associated with that corpus,

19
00:00:38.295 --> 00:00:42.435
you would have a set of unique
words, your vocabulary.

20
00:00:42.435 --> 00:00:43.945
In this example,

21
00:00:43.945 --> 00:00:48.020
your vocabulary would
have eight unique words.

22
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.600
For this particular example
of sentiment analysis,

23
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.100
you have two classes.

24
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.780
One class associated with

25
00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.364
positive sentiment and the
other with negative sentiment.

26
00:00:59.364 --> 00:01:00.730
So taking your corpus,

27
00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.410
you'd have a set of two tweets

28
00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.375
that belong to the
positive class,

29
00:01:04.375 --> 00:01:06.100
and the sets of two tweets that

30
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.020
belong to the negative class.

31
00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.640
Let's take the sets
of positive tweets.

32
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.765
Now, take a look at
your vocabulary.

33
00:01:12.765 --> 00:01:14.715
To get the positive frequency in

34
00:01:14.715 --> 00:01:16.435
any word in your vocabulary,

35
00:01:16.435 --> 00:01:18.010
you will have to
count the times as it

36
00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.125
appears in the positive tweets.

37
00:01:20.125 --> 00:01:22.195
For instance, the word happy

38
00:01:22.195 --> 00:01:25.075
appears one time in the
first positive tweet,

39
00:01:25.075 --> 00:01:28.420
and another time in the
second positive tweet.

40
00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.570
So it's positive
frequency is two.

41
00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.000
The complete table
looks like this.

42
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.080
Feel free to take a pause and
check any of its entries.

43
00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.090
The same logic applies for

44
00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.695
getting the negative frequency.

45
00:01:41.695 --> 00:01:43.930
However, for the sake of clarity,

46
00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:45.040
look at some example,

47
00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.290
the word am appears two times in

48
00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.455
the first tweet and another
time in the second one.

49
00:01:50.455 --> 00:01:53.020
So it's negative
frequency is three.

50
00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.940
Take a look at the
entire table for

51
00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.090
negative frequencies and feel
free to check its values.

52
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.920
So this is the entire table with

53
00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.635
the positive and negative
frequencies for your corpus.

54
00:02:05.635 --> 00:02:07.665
In practice when coding,

55
00:02:07.665 --> 00:02:10.085
this table is a
dictionary mapping from

56
00:02:10.085 --> 00:02:12.710
a word class there
to its frequency.

57
00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.650
So it maps the word and
its corresponding class to

58
00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.120
the frequency or the number of

59
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.185
times that's where it
showed up in the class.

60
00:02:20.185 --> 00:02:23.425
You now know how to create
a frequency dictionary,

61
00:02:23.425 --> 00:02:26.030
which maps a word
and the class to

62
00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.310
the number of times that word

63
00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.345
showed up in the
corresponding class.

64
00:02:29.345 --> 00:02:31.370
In the next video,
you're going to use

65
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.460
your frequency dictionary
to represent a tweet.
