00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.641
>> I want you to meet my friends,
Jonas and Lucas,

2
00:00:02.641 --> 00:00:05.590
the instructors of this specialization.

3
00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:06.412
>> Hi, everyone.

4
00:00:06.412 --> 00:00:08.592
>> Welcome to the specialization.

5
00:00:08.592 --> 00:00:10.773
>> I know Jonas for many years.

6
00:00:10.773 --> 00:00:13.746
He is an instructor at
Stanford University and

7
00:00:13.746 --> 00:00:17.722
has also helped me create
the deep learning specialization.

8
00:00:17.722 --> 00:00:22.661
Over the years, Jonas unice has taught
hundreds of students learning AI and

9
00:00:22.661 --> 00:00:26.750
machine learning and NLP and
other topics for the first time and

10
00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.253
he's also mentor students on a huge
variety of AI related projects.

11
00:00:31.253 --> 00:00:33.352
So I really thrilled to have you with us.

12
00:00:33.352 --> 00:00:37.000
>> Thanks for the introduction and
it is always great working with you.

13
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.914
>> Lucas is a member of the Google Brain
team where he does research on deep

14
00:00:41.914 --> 00:00:43.261
learning and NLP.

15
00:00:43.261 --> 00:00:48.427
So everything from machine translation
to parsing, he is the co-author

16
00:00:48.427 --> 00:00:53.442
of Google's TensorFlow system as
well as of the transformer network.

17
00:00:53.442 --> 00:00:58.425
And so his work has had a huge
influence on all of NLP and AI.

18
00:00:58.425 --> 00:01:03.514
I'm really excited to also have Lucas
as an instructor of the specialization.

19
00:01:03.514 --> 00:01:06.150
>> Thanks for the introduction, Andrew.

20
00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.522
>> Jonas and Lucas will walk
you through the most important

21
00:01:09.522 --> 00:01:12.185
concepts in natural language processing.

22
00:01:12.185 --> 00:01:16.202
NLP has changed a lot over
the last several decades.

23
00:01:16.202 --> 00:01:22.348
The view has started off using primarily
rule-based systems where someone might

24
00:01:22.348 --> 00:01:28.313
code of a rule like you see the word good,
then assume this is a positive customer

25
00:01:28.313 --> 00:01:33.677
review to then using probabilistic
systems that perform much better.

26
00:01:33.677 --> 00:01:38.515
But still require a lot of hand
engineering to know where NLP

27
00:01:38.515 --> 00:01:43.182
relies much more on machine learning and
deep learning.

28
00:01:43.182 --> 00:01:46.727
>> More recently with the rise of
powerful computers, we can now

29
00:01:46.727 --> 00:01:51.654
train end-to-end systems that would have
been impossible to train a few years ago.

30
00:01:51.654 --> 00:01:55.705
We can now capture more complicated
patterns and we can use these models

31
00:01:55.705 --> 00:02:00.260
in question answering in chatbots,
and then other applications.

32
00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.568
>> Many of these applications
are built with attention models,

33
00:02:03.568 --> 00:02:06.443
which you are going to learn
in this specialization.

34
00:02:06.443 --> 00:02:10.484
A few years ago, these models would
take weeks or even months to train.

35
00:02:10.484 --> 00:02:14.632
But with attention, you can train
these models in just a few hours.

36
00:02:14.632 --> 00:02:19.950
>> In this specialization, you learn
to build NLP technologies including

37
00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.713
the same technologies as what's deployed
in many large commercial systems.

38
00:02:25.713 --> 00:02:29.922
In the first course, you learn about
classification and vector spaces.

39
00:02:29.922 --> 00:02:32.393
Jonas, can you tell us a bit
about the first course?

40
00:02:32.393 --> 00:02:36.955
>> Sure, in course one, you will learn to
distinguish between pieces of text with

41
00:02:36.955 --> 00:02:39.761
positive sentiments and
negative sentiments.

42
00:02:39.761 --> 00:02:44.031
You will do so using logistic
regression and naive Bayes classifiers.

43
00:02:44.031 --> 00:02:47.828
You will also learn to represent words,
queries and

44
00:02:47.828 --> 00:02:52.587
documents including other pieces
of text as numbers in vectors.

45
00:02:52.587 --> 00:02:55.492
You will build your first
machine translation system and

46
00:02:55.492 --> 00:02:59.185
you will learn about locality sensitive
hashing which is just a method,

47
00:02:59.185 --> 00:03:01.379
that will help you with efficient search.

48
00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:02.871
>> Thanks Jonas.

49
00:03:02.871 --> 00:03:07.590
After the first course, you then go on
to the second course in which you learn

50
00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.522
probabilistic models in NLP.

51
00:03:09.522 --> 00:03:13.762
So these are things like given a few
words, what is the probability of the next

52
00:03:13.762 --> 00:03:16.971
word being the word the versus of,
verus something else.

53
00:03:16.971 --> 00:03:21.770
So these are algorithms that all of
us are maybe using almost every day.

54
00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.821
And in this specialization, you will learn
how to build these algorithms yourself.

55
00:03:27.821 --> 00:03:32.058
After the first two courses with
the foundation that I gives you,

56
00:03:32.058 --> 00:03:36.540
you then go on to the third course
which teaches you sequence models.

57
00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.279
And finally, in the fourth course,
you learn about attention models and

58
00:03:41.279 --> 00:03:44.260
this will take you up to
say to the art NLP models

59
00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.094
useful things like chatbots question
answering and text summarization.

60
00:03:49.094 --> 00:03:51.393
Jonas, you want to say
a few words about that?

61
00:03:51.393 --> 00:03:53.567
>> By the time you complete scores for,

62
00:03:53.567 --> 00:03:57.988
you will be able to implement state of
the art neural machine translation,

63
00:03:57.988 --> 00:04:01.163
summarization, question answering and
chatbots.

64
00:04:01.163 --> 00:04:03.682
We will show you how you
can combine attention and

65
00:04:03.682 --> 00:04:07.850
parallel computing to build these
systems from the ground up.

66
00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:10.313
These models have high impact in industry.

67
00:04:10.313 --> 00:04:13.858
They could be used, for example,
to automate call centers or

68
00:04:13.858 --> 00:04:17.482
businesses can use them to make
sense of large volumes of data.

69
00:04:17.482 --> 00:04:22.089
>> I'm really excited for everyone to
get started to take these courses,

70
00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:26.333
learn these technologies and
to go build some great NLP systems.

71
00:04:26.333 --> 00:04:27.552
>> Let's get started.

72
00:04:27.552 --> 00:04:29.642
>> Awesome, see you in the classroom.

73
00:04:29.642 --> 00:04:30.460
>> Let's jump in.
