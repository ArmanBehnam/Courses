00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.370
In this video, you
will get an overview

2
00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.890
of this week's
learning objectives.

3
00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.620
In this fourth and final
week of this course,

4
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:08.730
you will learn to implement

5
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.440
machine translation to translate

6
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.620
the English word "hello" to
the French word "bonjour".

7
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.150
You will also learn to
implement document search.

8
00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.710
For example, given a document
such as the sentence,

9
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.000
"Can I get a refund?"

10
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.625
You can search for similar
documents such as,

11
00:00:23.625 --> 00:00:25.245
what's your return policy?

12
00:00:25.245 --> 00:00:27.755
Or may I get my money back?

13
00:00:27.755 --> 00:00:29.990
You will learn any sets of
skills that you can apply

14
00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.560
to both of these
useful NLP tasks.

15
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.490
Here's a preview of
the skills that you'll

16
00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.235
practice in this week's
lectures and assignments.

17
00:00:37.235 --> 00:00:38.450
Don't worry if you do not

18
00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.565
understand what some of
these mean right now.

19
00:00:40.565 --> 00:00:42.770
You will learn about
each of these and get

20
00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.530
some practice before you
move on to the assignments.

21
00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.530
First, you will learn
about what it means

22
00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.695
to transform a vector
such as a word vector.

23
00:00:51.695 --> 00:00:54.650
You will learn how to
implement k nearest neighbors,

24
00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.925
which is a way of searching
for similar items.

25
00:00:57.925 --> 00:01:00.245
You'll learn about hash tables,

26
00:01:00.245 --> 00:01:01.610
which will help you assign

27
00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.010
your word vectors into subsets.

28
00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.050
Then you will learn how to

29
00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.450
divide the vector
space into regions.

30
00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.370
Again, don't worry if you don't

31
00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.110
understand what this
means at this point,

32
00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.660
you'll get some visual
understanding of what this

33
00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.040
means and how it can help you

34
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.930
improve search for similar words.

35
00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:19.850
Finally, you'll know how to

36
00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.340
implement locality
sensitive hashing,

37
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.895
which helps you perform
approximate k nearest neighbors,

38
00:01:25.895 --> 00:01:29.240
an efficient way of searching
for similar word vectors.

39
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.940
By practicing how to find
similar word vectors,

40
00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.400
you'll effectively
know how to implement

41
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.295
machine translation
and document search.

42
00:01:37.295 --> 00:01:39.260
This is very exciting material,

43
00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:40.730
and we hope that you will really

44
00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.470
enjoy what you will
learn this week.
