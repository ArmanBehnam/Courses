00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280
You have done most of
the work to arrive at

2
00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.445
your log-likelihood
already. Now let's wrap up.

3
00:00:05.445 --> 00:00:08.490
Now you can calculate the
log-likelihood of the tweets

4
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.760
as the sum of the Lambdas
from each word in the tweet.

5
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.310
So for word I, you add 0,

6
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:16.185
for am you add 0.

7
00:00:16.185 --> 00:00:20.175
For word happy you add
2.2, for words because,

8
00:00:20.175 --> 00:00:25.365
I and am, you add 0 and for
word learning, you add 1.1.

9
00:00:25.365 --> 00:00:27.375
This sum is 3.3,

10
00:00:27.375 --> 00:00:30.310
and this value is higher than 0.

11
00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:34.940
Remember how previously
you saw that the tweet

12
00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.600
was positive if the product
was bigger than one.

13
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.510
With the log of 1 equal to 0,

14
00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.440
the positive values indicate
that the tweet is positive.

15
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.465
A value less than 0

16
00:00:47.465 --> 00:00:49.925
would indicate that
the tweet is negative.

17
00:00:49.925 --> 00:00:53.645
The log-likelihood for
this tweet is 3.3.

18
00:00:53.645 --> 00:00:56.575
Since 3.3 is bigger than 0,

19
00:00:56.575 --> 00:00:58.550
the tweet is positive.

20
00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.590
Notice that this score is based

21
00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.845
entirely on the words
happy and learning,

22
00:01:03.845 --> 00:01:06.815
both of which carry a
positive sentiments.

23
00:01:06.815 --> 00:01:08.150
All the other words were

24
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.030
neutral and didn't
contribute to the score.

25
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.030
See how much influence
the power words have.

26
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.635
Let's do a quick recap.

27
00:01:15.635 --> 00:01:17.570
You used your new
skills to predict

28
00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.550
the sentiment of a tweet by

29
00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.320
summing all the Lambdas

30
00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.660
for each word that's
appeared in the tweets.

31
00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.100
This score is called
the log-likelihood.

32
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.165
For the log-likelihood
the decision threshold

33
00:01:29.165 --> 00:01:30.725
is 0 instead of 1.

34
00:01:30.725 --> 00:01:32.915
Positive tweets will have

35
00:01:32.915 --> 00:01:35.765
a positive
log-likelihood above 0,

36
00:01:35.765 --> 00:01:38.045
and negative tweets will have

37
00:01:38.045 --> 00:01:41.020
a negative
log-likelihood below 0.

38
00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:46.045
Well done. Now you can compute
using log-likelihoods.

39
00:01:46.045 --> 00:01:47.900
They make many things
simpler and they

40
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.089
also help with
numerical stability.

41
00:01:50.089 --> 00:01:51.710
Let's use them to implement

42
00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.450
the naive-bayes method
in the next video.
