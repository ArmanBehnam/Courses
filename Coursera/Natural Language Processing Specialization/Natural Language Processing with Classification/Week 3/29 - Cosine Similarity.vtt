00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:04.780
Now that you have the intuition behind
the use of cosine of the angle between two

2
00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:10.400
vectors representations as a similarity
metric, I'll go deeper into an explanation

3
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.370
and then show you how to calculate
the cosine similarity metric.

4
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.520
In this section, you will get the cosine
of the inner angle of two vectors.

5
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.440
Then I'll show you how the value
of the cosine similarity

6
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.850
is related to the similarity of
the directions of two vectors.

7
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.720
First, you have to recall some
definitions from algebra.

8
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.240
The norm of a vector or
its magnitude is written like this.

9
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.700
It's defined to be the square root
of the sum of its elements squared.

10
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.720
The dot product between
two vectors is the sum

11
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.760
of the products between their elements
in each dimension of the vector space.

12
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.580
Let's take another look at two of
the corpora from the last section.

13
00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.800
Remember that in this example, you have
a vector space where the representation of

14
00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:02.200
the corpora is given by the number of
occurrences of the words disease and eggs.

15
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:07.040
The angle between those vector
representations is denoted by beta.

16
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.010
The agriculture corpus is
represented by the vector v, and

17
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.612
the history corpus is
going to be vector w.

18
00:01:13.612 --> 00:01:19.270
The dot products between those
vectors is defined as follows.

19
00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.960
From this equation, you see that
the cosine of the angle beta is equal

20
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.940
to the dot product between the vectors
divided by the product of the two norms.

21
00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.580
Replacing the actual values
from the vector representations

22
00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.650
should give you this expression.

23
00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.620
In the numerator, you have the product
between the occurrences of the words,

24
00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.150
disease and eggs.

25
00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.050
And in the denominator, you have
the product between the norm of the vector

26
00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.170
representations of the agriculture and
history corpora.

27
00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.750
Ultimately, you should get
a cosine similarity of 0.87.

28
00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.626
Feel free to pause and
do the calculations yourself.

29
00:02:01.465 --> 00:02:06.650
But what does this metric tell you about
the similarity of two different vectors?

30
00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:12.470
Consider when two vectors are orthogonal
in the vector spaces that you know so far.

31
00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.870
It is only possible to have
positive values for any dimension.

32
00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.660
So the maximum angle between
pair of vectors is 90 degrees.

33
00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.570
In that case, the cosine would be equal
to zero, and it would mean that the two

34
00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:32.920
vectors have orthogonal directions or
that they are maximally the similar.

35
00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.650
Now, let's look at the case where
the vectors have the same direction.

36
00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.020
In this case,
the angle between them is zero degrees and

37
00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.620
the cosine is equal to one,
because cosine of zero is just one.

38
00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.821
As you can see, as the cosine of the angle
between two vectors approaches one,

39
00:02:48.821 --> 00:02:50.700
the closer their directions are.

40
00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.800
Now, you know how to get the cosine
similarity between any pair of vectors.

41
00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.890
An important takeaway is that,
this metric is proportional

42
00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.460
to the similarity between the directions
of the vectors that you are comparing.

43
00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.950
And that for
the vector spaces you've seen so

44
00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.830
far, the cosine similarity
takes values between 0 and 1.

45
00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.835
You just computed that the cosine
similarity score between two vectors.

46
00:03:15.835 --> 00:03:19.900
In the next video, you will learn
how to manipulate these two vectors.

47
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:20.880
See you in the next video.
