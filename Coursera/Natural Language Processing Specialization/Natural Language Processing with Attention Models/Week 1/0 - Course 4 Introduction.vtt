00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.714
Welcome to the 4th and
final course of the specialization.

2
00:00:03.714 --> 00:00:08.829
This course is called Natural Language
Processing with Attention Models.

3
00:00:08.829 --> 00:00:10.754
When you finish this course,

4
00:00:10.754 --> 00:00:16.080
you have pretty much reached the cutting
edge of today's practical NLP methods.

5
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.420
You use a powerful technique called
attention to build several different

6
00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.982
models.

7
00:00:20.982 --> 00:00:24.662
Some of the things you build
using the attention mechanism,

8
00:00:24.662 --> 00:00:27.776
you build a powerful
language translation model.

9
00:00:27.776 --> 00:00:32.732
You also build an algorithm
capable of summarizing texts.

10
00:00:32.732 --> 00:00:37.722
You build a model that can actually
answer questions about the piece of text,

11
00:00:37.722 --> 00:00:42.352
and you build a chat bot that you can
actually have a conversation with.

12
00:00:42.352 --> 00:00:45.080
With the skills you
develop in this course,

13
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:50.020
you'll be able to build state of the art
NLP applications just like the ones used

14
00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.985
in many large companies
in the industry today.

15
00:00:52.985 --> 00:00:57.431
I'm pleased to again welcome Lucas and
Eunice as your instructors for

16
00:00:57.431 --> 00:00:58.343
this course.

17
00:00:58.343 --> 00:01:03.393
I know both of them are really excited
to get into the materials with you.

18
00:01:03.393 --> 00:01:08.432
Lucas told me the other day he finds
this course's topics very exciting.

19
00:01:08.432 --> 00:01:11.682
Lucas, maybe you could say
a bit more about that.

20
00:01:11.682 --> 00:01:14.104
>> Sure, thank you, Andrew.

21
00:01:14.104 --> 00:01:16.358
Well, as you sign the first course,

22
00:01:16.358 --> 00:01:19.942
the problem of sentiment
analysis is a really tricky one.

23
00:01:19.942 --> 00:01:24.266
But in many applications you want to
determine the sentiment of a sentence, so

24
00:01:24.266 --> 00:01:26.834
it's a really good problem
to work on as well.

25
00:01:26.834 --> 00:01:27.757
>> Thanks, Lucas.

26
00:01:27.757 --> 00:01:31.636
I still have very fond memories of
when I was leaving Google Brain, and

27
00:01:31.636 --> 00:01:35.333
it's nice to see the great work
that the team continues to put out.

28
00:01:35.333 --> 00:01:37.359
Eunice, what do you think?

29
00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:40.827
What are the most exciting aspects of
this course from your perspective?

30
00:01:40.827 --> 00:01:43.709
>> Well, Andrew,
there's a lot to be excited about.

31
00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:48.518
For starters, the model that you'll build
in this course represent the active areas

32
00:01:48.518 --> 00:01:51.071
of research at the cutting
edge of the field.

33
00:01:51.071 --> 00:01:54.411
But beyond that,
when it comes to modern deep learning,

34
00:01:54.411 --> 00:01:57.194
there's a sort of new normal,
which is to say,

35
00:01:57.194 --> 00:02:01.600
most people aren't actually building and
training models from scratch.

36
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.785
Instead, it's more common to
download a pre-trained model and

37
00:02:05.785 --> 00:02:09.372
then tweak it and find units for
your specific use case.

38
00:02:09.372 --> 00:02:13.116
In this course, we show you how
to build the models from scratch,

39
00:02:13.116 --> 00:02:17.765
but we also provide you custom pre-trained
models that we created just for you.

40
00:02:17.765 --> 00:02:22.538
By training them continuously for weeks
on the most powerful TPU clusters that

41
00:02:22.538 --> 00:02:26.019
are currently only available
to researchers as Google.

42
00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:29.611
You will practice the workflow
that's used in the industry,

43
00:02:29.611 --> 00:02:33.072
which is to fine tune state of
the art pre-trained models.

44
00:02:33.072 --> 00:02:35.363
The tools you take away from this course,

45
00:02:35.363 --> 00:02:39.432
you'll literally be able to build NLP
systems at the industry standard.

46
00:02:39.432 --> 00:02:43.673
>> Thanks very much, Eunice and Lucas for
that introduction to this course.

47
00:02:43.673 --> 00:02:48.147
This is a set of important materials
that the course will go over, so

48
00:02:48.147 --> 00:02:49.494
let's get into it.

49
00:02:49.494 --> 00:02:51.317
>> All right, let's get started.

50
00:02:51.317 --> 00:02:52.120
>> Good luck!
