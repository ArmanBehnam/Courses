00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.401
Welcome, I'll now be talking about one
of the most commonly used benchmarks,

2
00:00:04.401 --> 00:00:06.312
and natural language processing.

3
00:00:06.312 --> 00:00:09.485
Specifically, you will learn
about the glue benchmark.

4
00:00:09.485 --> 00:00:12.656
This is used to train, evaluate,
and analyze NLP tasks.

5
00:00:12.656 --> 00:00:15.950
Let's take a look at
this in some more detail.

6
00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:21.050
>> So, the glue benchmark stands for
general language understanding evaluation.

7
00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.462
And it is basically collection
that is used to train, evaluate,

8
00:00:25.462 --> 00:00:29.003
analyze natural language
understanding systems.

9
00:00:29.003 --> 00:00:33.408
It has a lot of data sets, and
each data set has several genres, and

10
00:00:33.408 --> 00:00:37.196
they have different sizes and
different difficulties.

11
00:00:37.196 --> 00:00:41.454
Some of them are for example,
used for coreference resolution.

12
00:00:41.454 --> 00:00:45.004
Others are just used for
simple sentiment analysis.

13
00:00:45.004 --> 00:00:48.666
Others are used for
question answering and so forth.

14
00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:51.250
And it is used with a leaderboard.

15
00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.543
So people can use the data sets, and

16
00:00:53.543 --> 00:00:57.070
see how well their models
perform compared to others.

17
00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:04.004
So the task is evaluated on could be, for
example, sentence, grammatical or not.

18
00:01:04.004 --> 00:01:07.960
For example, if a sentence makes sense or
it does not,

19
00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.282
it could be used on sentiments.

20
00:01:10.282 --> 00:01:13.378
It could be used to paraphrase some texts.

21
00:01:13.378 --> 00:01:18.240
It could be used on similarity
on question duplicates.

22
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.020
Weather question is answerable or
not, whether it's a contradiction,

23
00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.877
whether it's entailment.

24
00:01:24.877 --> 00:01:30.691
And also for the Winograd Schema, which
is basically trying to identify whether,

25
00:01:30.691 --> 00:01:35.400
a pronoun refers to a certain noun or
to another noun.

26
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.556
So it's used to drive research.

27
00:01:37.556 --> 00:01:41.638
As I said, that researchers usually
use the glue as a benchmark.

28
00:01:41.638 --> 00:01:46.115
It is also model agnostic, so
it doesn't matter which model you use.

29
00:01:46.115 --> 00:01:50.262
It just evaluates on glue and
see how well your model performs.

30
00:01:50.262 --> 00:01:54.114
And finally, it allows you to
make use of transfer learning,

31
00:01:54.114 --> 00:01:57.012
because you have access
to several datasets.

32
00:01:57.012 --> 00:02:00.714
And you can learn certain
things from different datasets,

33
00:02:00.714 --> 00:02:06.010
that will help you evaluate on
a completely new datasets within Google.

34
00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.373
>> You now not only know how to
implement states of the arts models,

35
00:02:09.373 --> 00:02:10.817
using this weeks content.

36
00:02:10.817 --> 00:02:12.761
But you also know how to evaluate it.

37
00:02:12.761 --> 00:02:15.913
In the next video,
I'll be talking about question answering.

38
00:02:15.913 --> 00:02:18.338
And I'll show you how you
can use these models,

39
00:02:18.338 --> 00:02:20.221
to build a sophisticated QA system.

40
00:02:20.221 --> 00:02:21.960
I'll see you in the next video.
