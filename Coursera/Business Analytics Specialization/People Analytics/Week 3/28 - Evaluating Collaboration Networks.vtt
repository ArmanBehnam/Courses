1
00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.940
So now we've got some insight into how
we can describe collaboration networks

2
00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.470
in terms of the five main building blocks
that help us to understand network size,

3
00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:14.380
network strength, range,
centrality, and density.

4
00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.940
Also how we can map
collaboration networks inside

5
00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:18.880
an organization that you're interested in.

6
00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.560
How can you actually draw
those collaboration networks,

7
00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.170
figure out who is collaborating with whom.

8
00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.510
In this fourth segment we're
going to look at how can we evaluate

9
00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:29.700
our collaboration networks.

10
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.080
So we've got our network map,
we know some things about it.

11
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.440
But is it good or is it bad?

12
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.010
Are people doing what they should be
doing in terms of collaborating or not?

13
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.460
So evaluating collaboration networks is
where the rubber really starts hitting

14
00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.150
the road in terms of really starting to
get some value out of all these tools and

15
00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.070
techniques that we can use
to analyze collaboration.

16
00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:56.100
So here is our 15 person team again,
new product development team.

17
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.450
And now we've really
got their network map.

18
00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.870
We've got all the data, that we need and
we're going to start thinking about,

19
00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.120
okay what can we really
take away from this,

20
00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.390
what insights can we
generate from our analysis?

21
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.240
So there's two main questions that we can
look at here and there are others too, but

22
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.580
these are probably two of the most
important ways in which we can use

23
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.570
network tools and techniques to evaluate
collaboration inside organizations.

24
00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.510
The first is to look at how do
collaboration patterns vary inside

25
00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.540
the organization and across
the different people in the network?

26
00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.730
And then the second is how do
collaboration patterns matter for

27
00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:35.460
important outcomes?

28
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.370
And so these maybe outcomes that are at
the individual level, group level,

29
00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:44.410
organizational level, maybe it's a unit of
a different kind, maybe it's a team, but

30
00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.250
how do collaboration patterns matter for
outcomes that we care about?

31
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.840
So we're going to take each of
these two questions in turn.

32
00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.580
And start off with,
how do collaboration patterns vary, okay?

33
00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.885
So here is where we apply those five
building blocks that we introduced

34
00:01:58.885 --> 00:02:03.143
back in the second segment; network size,
strength, range, density, centrality and

35
00:02:03.143 --> 00:02:05.159
there are other network measures too, but

36
00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.038
these are five of the most
important metrics that we can use.

37
00:02:08.038 --> 00:02:10.745
And I'm just going to focus on
one right now for simplicity,

38
00:02:10.745 --> 00:02:13.110
let's say network size okay?

39
00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.660
So if we look at network size and we're
going to map, what we want to do is to

40
00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.780
use this building block of network
size and we want to compare across

41
00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.010
each of the individuals in the network
how big is their network, right?

42
00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.680
And I'm not going to do every
single individual in the network,

43
00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.430
there's 15 of them,
I'm just going to pick 5 people.

44
00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.600
So we have Lee, John,
Paul, Helen and Julia.

45
00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.580
Now network size, in this particular
network that we've been looking at,

46
00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.430
is actually a little bit
complicated because as you've seen

47
00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.180
there are one way arrows and
there's two way arrows.

48
00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.670
There's network size in terms
of what we call inbound size

49
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.460
which is the number of people who
seek information from person A.

50
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.230
So we can count the number of people who
seek information from Lee, from John,

51
00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.660
from Paul, right,
from Helen and from Julia.

52
00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.780
There's also network size in terms of
the number of people that Lee goes to,

53
00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.800
to get information, so
your network may be different if you count

54
00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.080
the number of people that you go to, or
the number of people who come to you.

55
00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.850
Those are two different aspects of
the network size that are both embedded in

56
00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.800
this particular diagram.

57
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.750
So if we think about the in-bound
size of the network,

58
00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.580
Lee has three people who come to him for
information.

59
00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.190
And the out-bound size, he goes to two
people to get information that he needs.

60
00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.610
So even just looking at these simple
numbers across these five people,

61
00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.640
we start to ask ourselves some questions,
right?

62
00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.920
And this is really what network
methods allow you to do.

63
00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.250
They don't give you all the answers,
but they allow you to ask pointed and

64
00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.890
important questions about the network and
who's collaborating with whom.

65
00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.130
What we can see, for example,
very strikingly is Paul.

66
00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.170
We know that Paul is an important player.

67
00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.910
Here we see that 9 people go to Paul for
information that they need.

68
00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.730
And Paul only goes to 3
people himself right?

69
00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.840
So Paul is doing a lot of giving there and
not a lot of taking [LAUGH] right?

70
00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.490
On the other hand John only has
1 person who comes to him for

71
00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:01.520
information and he goes to 2 people.

72
00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.225
So he's inbalanced in the other direction.

73
00:04:04.225 --> 00:04:06.500
Helen and Julie are pretty balanced they
got the same number of people coming

74
00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.410
to them as they go to.

75
00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.520
So again this is not to
say that this is good or

76
00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:14.940
bad necessarily but when we look at
these sort of very simple descriptive

77
00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.390
statistics based in this case just on
that one building block of network size.

78
00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.746
We can look across individuals, and we can
say, well, Paul is doing something that

79
00:04:21.746 --> 00:04:24.837
looks pretty different from John, and
even different from Helen and Julia.

80
00:04:24.837 --> 00:04:28.315
We can look across individuals, and
we can also look over time, and

81
00:04:28.315 --> 00:04:31.620
understand how their networks
are changing over time, right?

82
00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.152
So are the number of network ties,
the outbound ties changing over time,

83
00:04:35.152 --> 00:04:37.700
are there numbers of inbound
ties changing over time.

84
00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.670
If we do, for example, a network survey at
different points in time, after one year,

85
00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:42.290
after two years.

86
00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:45.890
So if we're trying to change the networks,
are those changes really taking place?

87
00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:52.000
So why do these kinds of statistics
matter, what can they help us to do?

88
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Well, if you think about this from
a people analytics perspective,

89
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.860
there's lots of things in
terms of managing people,

90
00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.545
that being able to see
these kinds of numbers,

91
00:05:00.545 --> 00:05:04.560
and analyze these kinds of statistics,
can really help us with, right?

92
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.590
They help us with things like, just some
examples here, performance assessment.

93
00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:14.180
So if we're evaluating Paul,
we probably should be evaluating Paul

94
00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.390
not just on how he does his own work but
on how much he's helping people.

95
00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:19.820
That's a very important part of
what he's spending his time doing.

96
00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.880
And if we're not evaluating him on that,
he's not getting any credit for that.

97
00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.342
And that relates to the pay and
promotion,s are we not only accessing but

98
00:05:26.342 --> 00:05:28.480
also rewarding this kind of behavior.

99
00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.890
because if we're not rewarding it,
it's going to stop, so

100
00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:35.130
we may want to change the way that we pay
people, the way that we access people,

101
00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:39.490
to take into account some of these
inbalances that we're seeing, or

102
00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:40.990
the patterns we're seeing in the network.

103
00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:44.360
Do people have the right roles and
responsibilities.

104
00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.491
We might be thinking about, well Paul
actually is a very senior person who

105
00:05:47.491 --> 00:05:50.535
shouldn't be spending all his time
giving other people information.

106
00:05:50.535 --> 00:05:52.638
He has more valuable things
to do with his time,

107
00:05:52.638 --> 00:05:55.650
maybe there is somebody less senior
who could be doing this better.

108
00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.860
So it helps us to think about whether
people have the right roles or

109
00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:02.500
responsibilities and it might help us also
with things like training and mentoring.

110
00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:06.190
So if you look at the people who really
seem to need a lot of help from other

111
00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:08.250
people, maybe those are people
who should be targeted for

112
00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:11.920
particular kinds of training or
mentoring kinds of programs.

113
00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:14.450
Or maybe they're just junior in the
organization, they're finding their way

114
00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:17.140
around and this will play itself
out over a couple of years.

115
00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:21.300
So we have to really understand why, when
we see a network pattern, it's happening.

116
00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:25.440
But the first step is to see the pattern
and be able to analyze and understand it.

117
00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.590
So that's the first question.

118
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:29.390
How do collaboration patterns vary?

119
00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:33.340
The other important set of
questions that we can use or

120
00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.010
look at when we're evaluating networks.

121
00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:38.400
Really important here is how do
collaboration patterns matter for

122
00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.213
important outcomes that we care about for
our employees, or our teams, or

123
00:06:42.213 --> 00:06:45.258
our groups, or our units, or
the organization as a whole?

124
00:06:45.258 --> 00:06:48.230
So what is it these collaboration
patterns actually affect?

125
00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:53.755
Again, say we've got these
five building blocks, and

126
00:06:53.755 --> 00:06:57.484
maybe we're just going to look at network
size for a minute but what we really want

127
00:06:57.484 --> 00:07:01.101
to do now is to map that to individual
outcomes, again they could be a group or

128
00:07:01.101 --> 00:07:04.602
organizational outcomes, but
let's say individual outcomes.

129
00:07:04.602 --> 00:07:07.980
And there's lots of individual outcomes
we might care about in terms of managing

130
00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:11.830
people inside organizations, but
let's just focus on performance, right?

131
00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:15.960
Performance is a very important individual
outcome, so the question that we

132
00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:19.490
then construct to answer when we
have these kind of network data are,

133
00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:24.580
how do the attributes of our collaboration
network affect individual performance?

134
00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:26.675
And here this gets very complicated.

135
00:07:26.675 --> 00:07:29.826
There's lots of possibilities,
lots of ways to look at and

136
00:07:29.826 --> 00:07:32.030
analyze these kinds of patterns.

137
00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:35.090
So just to give you a very simple example.

138
00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:38.840
We can look essentially at correlations
between attributes of the network, so

139
00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:42.650
say it's network size, and
individual performance.

140
00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:45.450
And so again we have these two kinds
of network size in this example.

141
00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:49.910
So we have inbound ties, the number of
people who seek information from you.

142
00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:52.620
And maybe you find that there's
a positive correlation between

143
00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:56.220
the number of people that seek information
from you and how well you perform.

144
00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:59.470
And maybe you might see that,
because people who tend to perform well,

145
00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:01.445
other people come to them for advice.

146
00:08:01.445 --> 00:08:05.480
But outbound ties, maybe you see
a negative correlation with performance,

147
00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:07.326
the people who tend to go to other people,

148
00:08:07.326 --> 00:08:11.265
go to a lot of other people for
information that they need for their work.

149
00:08:11.265 --> 00:08:13.325
Maybe they tend to perform less well.

150
00:08:13.325 --> 00:08:14.475
And that's not causal.

151
00:08:14.475 --> 00:08:17.426
It's not because they go to other people
that they perform less well, but it's

152
00:08:17.426 --> 00:08:20.396
usually probably because they're junior or
they don't know the area so well.

153
00:08:20.396 --> 00:08:23.359
So again, we might see a result but we
then have to ask ourselves why do we see

154
00:08:23.359 --> 00:08:25.399
that result,
before we can actually take action.

155
00:08:25.399 --> 00:08:28.984
But being able to evaluate how
our network building blocks

156
00:08:28.984 --> 00:08:33.595
are associated with performance outcomes
or outcomes that we care about,

157
00:08:33.595 --> 00:08:37.340
is a critical step in being able
to get to that intervention.

158
00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:40.840
So what we're doing here is
a correlational analysis.

159
00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:44.339
Or when you get more sophisticated, you're
going to be thinking about a multivariate

160
00:08:44.339 --> 00:08:47.788
analysis where you can control for some of
the variables, and look at the effects of

161
00:08:47.788 --> 00:08:51.180
others more specifically in terms
of how they matter for outcomes.

162
00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:54.910
You're trying to identify relationships
between the network variables and

163
00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:56.050
outcomes.

164
00:08:56.050 --> 00:08:59.070
And again, what kinds of implications
does this have for managing employees?

165
00:08:59.070 --> 00:08:59.990
Well all sorts, right?

166
00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:03.280
Depending on what your outcomes
are that you're trying to look at.

167
00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:06.190
Again, it can matter for
performance assessment, for roles and

168
00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:08.500
responsibilities, pay and promotion.

169
00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:10.030
Who you want to train and mentor.

170
00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:13.270
Maybe it matters for
job rotations and career development.

171
00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:15.610
You want to get people opportunities
to grow their networks,

172
00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:19.160
if that really you find that, that is
really associated with better performance.

173
00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.030
Maybe even retention.

174
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:23.783
If you find the people who a lot
of people come to for advice,

175
00:09:23.783 --> 00:09:27.586
maybe your outcome that you're going to
measure is whether people feel burned out,

176
00:09:27.586 --> 00:09:30.176
they're more likely to leave
the organization, and so

177
00:09:30.176 --> 00:09:32.628
this is going to have big implications for
retention.

178
00:09:32.628 --> 00:09:37.458
So depending on which network variables
you look at, and even more importantly,

179
00:09:37.458 --> 00:09:41.448
what outcome variables you look at,
you're going to be able to come up

180
00:09:41.448 --> 00:09:46.348
with action implications that are going to
be very important for the kinds of people,

181
00:09:46.348 --> 00:09:49.358
managing people implications
that we care about,

182
00:09:49.358 --> 00:09:52.183
when we're thinking
about people analytics.

183
00:09:52.183 --> 00:09:56.630
One thing to be very cautious
about is that there is no

184
00:09:56.630 --> 00:10:01.240
one best collaboration network for
every organization and every situation.

185
00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:04.806
So again it's not the bigger networks
are always better, it's not the denser or

186
00:10:04.806 --> 00:10:07.440
sparser networks are always better.

187
00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:11.182
You really have to be able to understand
how does a particular network

188
00:10:11.182 --> 00:10:14.420
configuration map to outcomes
in a particular situation.

189
00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:17.442
So to understand what's best for
your organization and your situation,

190
00:10:17.442 --> 00:10:19.159
you need to collect and analyze the data.

191
00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:22.180
You can't just say,
well we have this network configuration,

192
00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:23.310
that's good, that's bad.

193
00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:24.850
We actually need to map that and

194
00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:28.180
we can connect it to outcomes that we
care about to really know whether or

195
00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:30.270
not it's good or bad and
what we might be able to do about it.
