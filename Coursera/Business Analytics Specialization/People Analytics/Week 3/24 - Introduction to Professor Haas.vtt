Hi, I'm Martine Haas.

2
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.780
I'm a Professor of Management
at the Wharton School.

3
00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:10.650
My research is on collaboration.

4
00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.040
And in this module, we are gonna be
talking about people analytics and

5
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.230
collaboration.

6
00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.340
So we're gonna be focusing on
how we can use the tools and

7
00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.200
techniques of people analytics
to describe, map, evaluate.

8
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.860
And hopefully, ultimately improve
collaboration inside organizations.

9
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:29.680
So let's get started.
