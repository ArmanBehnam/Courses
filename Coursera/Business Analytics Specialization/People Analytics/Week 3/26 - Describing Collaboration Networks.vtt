1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.780
So with that introduction under our belts,

2
00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:07.588
we're gonna move now into the four
main segments of this module.

3
00:00:07.588 --> 00:00:10.370
We are gonna talk about describe
collaboration networks, when we talk about

4
00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.100
collaboration patents we are gonna focus
specifically on thinking about in terms of

5
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.110
networks.

6
00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.030
And then later we will move into mapping,
on how to map collaboration networks,

7
00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.370
how to evaluate them and how to intervene.

8
00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:24.040
So moving into segment two, how do we
describe our collaboration networks.

9
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.680
So what I'm gonna do in this segment
is to introduce you to a number of

10
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.270
building blocks that can basically provide
some vocabulary, some terminology for

11
00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.089
analyzing collaboration networks.

12
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.930
But let's make sure that we understand
exactly where we're coming from because I

13
00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.230
went and introduced you to
the idea of networks pretty fast.

14
00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.620
So what are organizational networks?

15
00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.180
Just to make sure we really get this.

16
00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.810
So let me show you first a picture that is
gonna look like many pictures that you're

17
00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:51.810
probably familiar with.

18
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.690
So this is a formal structure
of an organization.

19
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.230
It's basically an organizational chart.

20
00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.620
It's a real organizational chart,
it comes from the exploration and

21
00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.580
production division of a large
petro-chemical company.

22
00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.710
And this is the senior executives and

23
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.660
they're reporting structure
within this organization.

24
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.740
So you can see who reports to whom just
like the organizations that many of you

25
00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:13.930
will be working for.

26
00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.310
You'll probably recognize you
have a reporting structure,

27
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.520
an organization chart in
most organizations, right?

28
00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.370
But when we talk about an organizational
network we mean something a little bit

29
00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:25.650
different.

30
00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.630
For this particular organization for
exploration and production division.

31
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.400
We can draw an organizational network that
tells us who actually interacts with who.

32
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.670
Who actually collaborates with whom in
this organization not whose supposed

33
00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.450
to collaborate with him or who formally
reports to him, but who actually interacts

34
00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.970
with him and the network that you can see
when you draw this kind of a chart is

35
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.450
really quite different from the one you
see in the formal organizational chart.

36
00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.260
So if you take Cole who's at
the center of the informal network,

37
00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.830
you see if you look at the formal
structure the organizational chart,

38
00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.400
Cole is way down there in the side
reporting structure, right?

39
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.070
But in the organizational network he's
very, very central that means many people

40
00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.030
are coming to him and
he's probably communicating and

41
00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.770
interacting with many people
to get his work done.

42
00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.310
So we see quite a different structure and

43
00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.060
it sort of draws attention to some people
that we might not notice as much if we're

44
00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.540
only looking at the formal
organizational chart.

45
00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.330
So we have the formal structure but

46
00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.010
when we're talking about organizational
networks we're talking about

47
00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.150
the informal structure of the
organization, who actually works with who?

48
00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.975
It's worth noting that there are many
different kinds of organizational networks

49
00:02:30.975 --> 00:02:34.855
so we're gonna be focusing throughout
this module on collaboration networks.

50
00:02:34.855 --> 00:02:37.355
Which might be who shares
information with whom,

51
00:02:37.355 --> 00:02:40.665
how information flow around the network,
who shares knowledge with whom.

52
00:02:40.665 --> 00:02:43.650
But we could draw networks that
are simply based on who talks to whom.

53
00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.780
Communication, who's friendly with whom,
were friendship ties.

54
00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.170
Who gives advice to whom, who trusts whom.

55
00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.400
So there are many different,
and their could be many others.

56
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.330
There are many different basis for
drawing network maps,

57
00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.420
but we're really focusing on
collaboration networks here.

58
00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.150
So the kinds of ties
that we're interested in,

59
00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.280
collaborations between
employees inside organizations.

60
00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.280
So back to the example of a collaboration
network that I showed you in the previous

61
00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.310
segment.

62
00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.160
So again, if you remember
there are 15 people in this

63
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.750
new product development team, they're in
three different parts of the organization,

64
00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.850
but they're working together
to get things done,

65
00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.140
and often seeking information from each
other in order to get their work done.

66
00:03:23.678 --> 00:03:27.280
So, I wanna take a minute to ask
you to think about this question.

67
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.100
Just looking at this network,
who do you think you might want to be?

68
00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.740
And why?

69
00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.100
So if you look at the network, who do you
think you might want to be in that network

70
00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.950
and what would be your reasons?

71
00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:40.880
Just take a second to think about that.

72
00:03:46.643 --> 00:03:51.042
So, a quick reaction, if you're looking
at this network for the first time,

73
00:03:51.042 --> 00:03:53.972
might well be, well,
I think I might wanna be Paul or

74
00:03:53.972 --> 00:03:57.050
maybe I wanna be Helen in this network,
right?

75
00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:58.990
And why would we say Paul or Helen?

76
00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:00.780
Probably, because they're very central,

77
00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.260
they look pretty important
in this network.

78
00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.480
They're in the middle of all the action,
they've got lots of people coming to them

79
00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.200
and maybe they're going to
quite a few people themselves.

80
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.720
And so they're in the middle of
where it's happening, right?

81
00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.620
And so that seems like maybe
a good network position to be in.

82
00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.670
But can you think of any reasons why
you wouldn't wanna be Paul or Helen?

83
00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:20.869
Why is not a good idea sometimes
to be in the middle of a network?

84
00:04:23.543 --> 00:04:28.381
So one possible reason that you might be
thinking If you actually have a lot of

85
00:04:28.381 --> 00:04:32.012
people coming to you for
information or advice might be,

86
00:04:32.012 --> 00:04:34.600
well it's actually takes a lot of time.

87
00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.510
When a lot of people are knocking on your
door and asking you all the time for

88
00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.570
things that they need, it takes away
from your structured work time.

89
00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.660
So that might be one reason, right,
so maybe you're feeling a little

90
00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.050
bit overloaded if you're
central in the network.

91
00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.433
Now somebody you might
not have wanted to be.

92
00:04:48.433 --> 00:04:51.638
If you think about who would you least
like to be in this network, right.

93
00:04:51.638 --> 00:04:52.335
Who would you least want to be?

94
00:04:52.335 --> 00:04:53.597
If you look at the map,

95
00:04:53.597 --> 00:04:57.700
probably pretty quickly you might say
well I wouldn't want to be Kevin.

96
00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.280
Kevin's pretty isolated out there.

97
00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.180
He's all by himself.

98
00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:01.130
Nobody's talking to him.

99
00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:02.060
He's not talking to anybody.

100
00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.710
It doesn't seem like it's much fun to
be Kevin and that's probably true.

101
00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.560
Kevin seems pretty cutoff.

102
00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.530
Now why might Kevin like being cut off?

103
00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:13.640
Why might this actually be,
in some ways, an advantageous position?

104
00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.180
Well it's not good to be out
of the network flows, but

105
00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.330
everybody's leaving Kevin alone.

106
00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.360
Maybe Kevin just gets on with his job,
really enjoys what he's doing,

107
00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.000
has plenty of time to get things done.

108
00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:27.810
So these are just some
very initial intuitions.

109
00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:32.840
But what they start pointing us towards
is this idea that where you're positioned

110
00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.140
in a collaboration network really matters.

111
00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:39.040
So the structure of the network and your
position in that network is gonna matter

112
00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.600
a lot for you to get your work done and
for how overloaded you feel, how satisfied

113
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:47.570
you feel, whether you enjoy being in
the workplace, lots of different things.

114
00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:50.050
So when we look at a network map like
this, there's a lot going on and

115
00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.330
we can get a little bit
of an intuition about it.

116
00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:57.660
But what I wanna do is to build in
some real basic building blocks here

117
00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:01.230
to help us look at this kind of
a network with more analytic rigor.

118
00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:03.900
And think about, okay, so
what are the specific things that we can

119
00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.820
learn when we look at even the simple
kind of network like this?

120
00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:08.720
And this is a pretty simple network,
it's only 15 people.

121
00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:13.110
So let's move towards thinking
about how can we describe

122
00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:14.529
these collaboration patterns?

123
00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.405
And I'm gonna introduce you
to five building blocks.

124
00:06:18.405 --> 00:06:22.898
Network size, strength, range,
density, and centrality.

125
00:06:22.898 --> 00:06:26.040
Okay, and we're gonna work
through each of these one by one.

126
00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:29.740
And I'm gonna just use a very simple
form of a network to help you

127
00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:34.340
understand the basic idea behind each of
these because they all have different

128
00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:37.110
ways to describe even the kind of
network that we just looked at,

129
00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:39.249
as well as more complex
networks inside organizations.

130
00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:45.110
So let's look at network size to building
blocks first, those are building blocks.

131
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:46.330
Network size.

132
00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:49.250
Okay, so building block one network
size is very straight forward, right?

133
00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:53.010
We've got two people two employees
in our organization, say Sarah and

134
00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:55.020
Ted, and what we're doing here.

135
00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:57.750
Is we're mapping the number of people
that they collaborate with, or

136
00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:01.220
that they go to and
exchange information with, right?

137
00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:03.677
And we can see that Sarah
goes to five other people or

138
00:07:03.677 --> 00:07:05.745
has collaborative ties with five people.

139
00:07:05.745 --> 00:07:09.251
Ted, on the other hand, has collaborative
ties with eight people, right?

140
00:07:09.251 --> 00:07:12.170
So Ted has a larger network than Sarah.

141
00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:16.080
Very basic, generally is it a good
idea to have a larger network?

142
00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.880
Yeah, it's probably a good idea when
you're networks relatively small,

143
00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:20.320
the more people that you're connected to,

144
00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:22.860
the more information you're
gonna be getting and so on.

145
00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:25.700
If you're network starts getting really
large though maybe you don't want more and

146
00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:27.070
more people so.

147
00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:28.620
There's nothing to say that anything,

148
00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:31.070
there's a particular network size
that's good or bad at this point.

149
00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:32.670
We're just saying,
how do we describe networks?

150
00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:35.250
Well, we can describe them in terms of
the number of people you're connected to,

151
00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:36.240
in terms of its size.

152
00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:40.060
Now, here's the second building block.

153
00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:43.440
This is network strength, okay.

154
00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:46.590
So if you look at this network, here we
have Sarah and Ted, and they both have

155
00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:51.210
five network ties, five connections to
people that they're collaborating with.

156
00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:54.370
But the thicker lines mean that
the ties are stronger, right?

157
00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:58.510
And so what you see is even though they
both have five connections, Sara's ties,

158
00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:01.060
four out of the five of them
are really pretty strong ties.

159
00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:03.880
Where as Ted's ties,
only one of them is a strong tie,

160
00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:07.540
the others are relatively weak ties and
that can matter.

161
00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:09.340
Strong ties can be really advantageous.

162
00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:11.550
You can really build
trust with those people.

163
00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:13.570
You can exchange information
with them a lot.

164
00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:14.860
You can believe what they say.

165
00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:19.780
But it also takes a lot of time
to maintain strong relationships.

166
00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:22.180
So trade-offs again a network strength.

167
00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:24.360
So we've got network size,
and network strength,

168
00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:26.130
are two important building blocks here.

169
00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:30.380
Again, we have stronger ties,
we have weaker ties.

170
00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:34.030
The third building block is network range.

171
00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:40.270
So network range is a measure of how many
different groups you're connected here.

172
00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:43.057
So here Sarah and
Ted both have five collaborators, or

173
00:08:43.057 --> 00:08:46.344
five people that they can turn to,
exchange information with.

174
00:08:46.344 --> 00:08:49.912
But Sarah, say Sarah works in
marketing in the marketing department,

175
00:08:49.912 --> 00:08:53.553
all of Sarah's five connections
are within the marketing department.

176
00:08:53.553 --> 00:08:58.020
Whereas Ted is connected to someone
in the marketing department, but

177
00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:03.014
he's also connected to somebody, say the
red dot is R and D, and the blue dot is

178
00:09:03.014 --> 00:09:09.000
Human Resources, the green dot is finance,
and the yellow dot is operations, right?

179
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.460
So, Ted has a much wider network range,
right?

180
00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:13.750
He has a high range network.

181
00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:15.400
Whereas Sarah's is a low range network.

182
00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:18.150
And when you have higher network range,

183
00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:21.130
you're connected to many more
different sources of information.

184
00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:24.380
So your ability to get information
from different sources,

185
00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:26.280
from a wider range of sources,
is much greater.

186
00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:30.170
So that's the third building block.

187
00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.700
The fourth building block
is network density.

188
00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:35.660
So this is getting a little
bit more complicated here.

189
00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:40.960
So network density, you start with,
just for simplicity's sake,

190
00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:45.960
Sarah and Ted both have five people
that they exchange information with.

191
00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:49.590
But now what I'm gonna do is give both
Sarah and Ted, each of the people that

192
00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:53.010
they're connected to, I'm gonna give each
of those people five people that they

193
00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:57.190
exchange information with, and you can
see some quite different patterns emerge.

194
00:09:57.190 --> 00:10:01.830
So I'm gonna give each of Sarah's
connections five connections of their own.

195
00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:05.070
What I'm giving them,

196
00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:08.860
is the same five people as exist
already in Sarah's network.

197
00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:11.215
So each of those people is
connected to each other and

198
00:10:11.215 --> 00:10:13.150
that's what we call a very dense network.

199
00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:15.981
On the other hand,
I'm gonna give Ted's five people,

200
00:10:15.981 --> 00:10:18.099
five people that they're connected to.

201
00:10:18.099 --> 00:10:21.414
Actually I'm gonna give them four, but
five people they are connected to but

202
00:10:21.414 --> 00:10:24.490
they are all connected to
really different people, right.

203
00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:27.100
So each of them has five different
people that they are connected to and so

204
00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:31.000
you can see really different patents in
this network as a result of the way that

205
00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.020
their second order connections work
like their friends of their friends or

206
00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:35.150
the connections of their connection.

207
00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:40.150
So, Sarah has a high density network,
where everybody knows each other basically

208
00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:43.840
and Ted has a low density network,
where really Ted is the presenter, and

209
00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:46.250
the people around the edges really
don't know each other at all.

210
00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:50.930
So, again there can be benefits to
a high density versus a low density

211
00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:51.620
network, right.

212
00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:52.990
So if you're in a high density network,

213
00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:55.780
where everybody knows each other,
that has some advantages.

214
00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:57.500
There's a lot of trust in
that kind of information,

215
00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:00.330
because if somebody tells you information,
you can easily confirm with your

216
00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:02.240
other friends whether that
information's right or not.

217
00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:05.669
But in a high-density network,

218
00:11:05.669 --> 00:11:09.137
you only have those five people
to give you information.

219
00:11:09.137 --> 00:11:12.980
If you are in a low density network, Ted
has a huge advantage in a sense of he has

220
00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:17.122
access not only to the five people that he
has connections with but those five people

221
00:11:17.122 --> 00:11:20.882
are getting information from an additional
in this case four people each.

222
00:11:20.882 --> 00:11:24.499
And so they're getting a lot of extra
information that doesn't exist in the high

223
00:11:24.499 --> 00:11:25.900
density network.

224
00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:30.050
So in a low density network, you have
access to a lot more information, but

225
00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:31.420
you don't have a lot of that trust and

226
00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:34.660
verification because somebody can tell you
something, and you have no way to verify

227
00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:39.250
whether that source is reliable you have
nobody else who's connected to them.

228
00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:41.300
So that's a high density
versus a low density network.

229
00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:46.340
And then the last building block,
which is very related,

230
00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:48.030
is the idea of network centrality.

231
00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:54.890
So, Sarah and all her contacts are all
equally central in their networks.

232
00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:57.380
They're all connected to the same
number of other people and

233
00:11:57.380 --> 00:11:59.400
they're all connected to
the same set of other people.

234
00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:03.520
So they're all equally central, but
you can quickly see that Ted's network.

235
00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:05.280
There's a lot of variation and
who's most central.

236
00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:06.730
Ted has most central there.

237
00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:11.970
He really basically has access to all the
information and that's sort how to system.

238
00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:15.820
The people that he is connected
directly to are moderately central but

239
00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:17.960
the people that they're connected
to are relatively peripheral.

240
00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:21.660
They only have basically access to,
one of Ted's friends.

241
00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:24.980
So centrality, we had those
intuitive ideas about centrality

242
00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:27.840
right from the beginning when we looked
at our new product development team.

243
00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:29.880
Here, we can see that centrality
is actually something we can

244
00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:31.230
measure and track.

245
00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:35.310
And that is has different implications,
depending on the configuration and

246
00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:36.179
structure of your network.

247
00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:40.970
So back to our example of
this collaboration network.

248
00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:47.380
You see some, these five building blocks
give us a different way to think about,

249
00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:52.890
or a more rigorous way to
analyze the network features for

250
00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:54.810
each individual on this network, right?

251
00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:57.460
So, we can ask, for
each of these individuals,

252
00:12:57.460 --> 00:12:59.150
what's the size of their network, right?

253
00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:01.170
It's pretty clear that Paul has
a pretty large network, and

254
00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:03.430
Kevin has a pretty small network, right.

255
00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:06.130
And we got that just by looking
at this map in the first place.

256
00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:09.190
We can look at network strengths,
and whether those ties are strong,

257
00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:12.640
and perhaps two-directional, and
whether they're pretty weak.

258
00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:14.220
We can look at network range.

259
00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:18.820
So if you think about that,
who has the highest range in this network.

260
00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:22.754
So remember range is about how many
different part of the organization for

261
00:13:22.754 --> 00:13:25.556
example, different groups
you're connected to.

262
00:13:25.556 --> 00:13:30.265
So here, it's pretty clear that Paul
has the highest network range, right?

263
00:13:30.265 --> 00:13:32.816
Because Paul is connected,
he's in finance, and

264
00:13:32.816 --> 00:13:37.089
he's connected to people who are both in
manufacturing and in marketing, and nobody

265
00:13:37.089 --> 00:13:41.030
else is connected to all three groups in
that way, so he has the highest range.

266
00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:45.110
If you think about density,
who has the densest network?

267
00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:47.290
So one of those groups where
everybody knows everybody.

268
00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:53.330
So Helen's network looks pretty dense,
right?

269
00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:55.600
Whereas Paul's network is pretty space,
right?

270
00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:57.380
Paul doesn't have a lot of
people who know each other.

271
00:13:57.380 --> 00:14:01.250
Paul's one of those very central people
In a networks that's pretty sparse.

272
00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:04.670
Helen is a pretty central person
in a network that's pretty dense.

273
00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:07.470
So they're both high in centrality.

274
00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:11.520
Helen's network is denser than Paul's
network just by eyeballing this.

275
00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:15.979
These are numbers that we can calculate
and are formulae for actually calculating

276
00:14:15.979 --> 00:14:19.673
how dense a network is and
how central people are in their networks.

277
00:14:19.673 --> 00:14:22.777
So when we think about this question
of who do you wanna be in this

278
00:14:22.777 --> 00:14:23.667
network and why?

279
00:14:23.667 --> 00:14:25.708
We can actually apply
these building blocks,

280
00:14:25.708 --> 00:14:28.064
analytic building blocks
to start understanding and

281
00:14:28.064 --> 00:14:31.529
preparing across individuals, and
to understand their network positions.

282
00:14:33.863 --> 00:14:37.541
So those are the basic building blocks for
understanding and

283
00:14:37.541 --> 00:14:40.290
describing collaboration networks.

284
00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:43.140
As we're gonna move forward, we're gonna
think about how to map those networks.

285
00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:47.050
How do we generate a network map that
helps us to see who is doing what and

286
00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:50.370
who is collaborating with whom inside
an organization that we wanna study?
