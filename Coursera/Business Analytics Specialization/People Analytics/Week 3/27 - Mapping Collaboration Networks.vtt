1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.380
So in this segment, we're gonna talk
about how to map collaboration networks.

2
00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.610
We now have some insight into
the building blocks that we can use to

3
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.660
describe collaboration networks,
but if we wanted to develop and

4
00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.900
actually be able to map and
draw out a collaboration network for

5
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.240
our own organization, or a particular
organization that we're interested in.

6
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.480
How do we come up with those network maps?

7
00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.020
This was the new product development team
that we've been looking at 15 people,

8
00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:25.440
in a pretty small team.

9
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.370
How do we understand which
direction these arrows go in?

10
00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:32.600
Who actually collaborates with whom
inside this particular team or

11
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.500
inside the larger organization?

12
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.800
Now, this is a pretty simple network map,
as I said, we only have 15 people here,

13
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.530
but actually, mapping networks can
get much more complicated than this.

14
00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.490
Here is a network map from a much
larger organization where you've got,

15
00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.070
several hundred people,
who are collaborating,

16
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.560
you're trying to figure out
who collaborates with whom.

17
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.600
So this kind of network map, it looks
like a giant fuzzy hairball, right?

18
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.540
This is pretty typical if you're trying to
map collaboration in a larger organization

19
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.000
with more employees and what you often
see in these kinds of network maps.

20
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.900
The ones that look like giant,

21
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.550
fuzzy hairballs, is that you have clusters
of employees who collaborate a lot.

22
00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.100
And, then there's bridges to other
clusters of employees who collaborate

23
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.750
along with each other.

24
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.190
So, this kind of collaboration map,
as you can imagine,

25
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:18.910
is actually pretty complex, right?

26
00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:23.668
And so, how do we go about generating
this kind of a map for our organization?

27
00:01:23.668 --> 00:01:28.020
What I wanna do is give
you a sense first for

28
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.530
what we're trying to get to here,
what kind of data we want to collect,

29
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.670
then we'll back up and
look at how do we collect that data.

30
00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.003
So this is an example of the kind of
network data that we're trying to collect

31
00:01:38.003 --> 00:01:41.247
and here, this example is for
the 15 member product development team.

32
00:01:41.247 --> 00:01:45.912
So in this particular matrix what we're
trying to generate basically is a matrix

33
00:01:45.912 --> 00:01:48.999
that says for
every individual in the organization or

34
00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:51.962
in this product development
team all 15 of them.

35
00:01:51.962 --> 00:01:56.032
If you list them down the column and
then you list the 15 people,

36
00:01:56.032 --> 00:01:59.584
same 15 people along the top,
along the row at the top,

37
00:01:59.584 --> 00:02:03.350
you're trying to find what
values should be in each cell.

38
00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.392
In other words, if you take Alex
right as one member of this team.

39
00:02:06.392 --> 00:02:10.920
You wannna know how frequently does Alex
seek information from Ali, from Bill,

40
00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.080
from Carl, from David and so on,
all the way down the column, all right?

41
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.110
Now this kind of a matrix for
this particular network question is also

42
00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.010
asymmetric, that means what you've got
in the bottom left corner are gonna

43
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.330
be different values possibly from
what you have in the top right corner

44
00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.500
because if you think about Alex could seek
information from Ally, Bill, and Kyle.

45
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.910
But if you take Ally,

46
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.540
Ally might not seek the same information
from Alex as Alex seeks from Ally.

47
00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.260
In other words Ally can
have different values for

48
00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.320
an answer to that question, they don't,
if I say I seek information from you,

49
00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.710
you don't necessarily say you
seek information from me.

50
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:47.970
So for each of these cells,
you want to figure out How much?

51
00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.380
What's their answer to this question
of how frequently do I seek information

52
00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.250
from this person.

53
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.745
Halley, Bill, Colin, David,
all the way down so,

54
00:02:55.745 --> 00:02:58.250
this is the kind of matrix
we're trying to populate.

55
00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.332
We're trying to figure out what
are the values in each of these cells

56
00:03:01.332 --> 00:03:03.180
in order to generate a network, right?

57
00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.210
This is what we need
to generate a network.

58
00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:07.400
So how do we get this
data in the first place?

59
00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.500
There's two main ways.

60
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.010
Probably the most commonly
used way is through surveys,

61
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.460
the other set of ways
is from other sources.

62
00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:21.470
There's lots of sources, and particularly
more and more sources coming available for

63
00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:22.600
collecting that work data.

64
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.270
But surveys are the main way that
network data is usually collected inside

65
00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:28.800
organizations, so
we're gonna focus mostly on that.

66
00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.860
So how do you collect
network data via surveys?

67
00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.150
This is fairly straightforward if you're
used to administering surveys inside

68
00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.250
organizations, and you know the basics
of survey administration, but I'm

69
00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.370
gonna just highlight a couple of things
that are distinctive for network data.

70
00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.990
So, we're gonna have to think about how to
identify our sample, create the survey,

71
00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:54.340
administer and monitor the survey and
clean and enter the data.

72
00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:59.300
So let's take each of those in turn,
so for identifying the sample.

73
00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.150
So when you're thinking about a network
the first thing that you have to do is

74
00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.670
figure out what's
the boundaries of that sample?

75
00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.030
In other words,
who is it that I want to survey?

76
00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.614
And for a network it's pretty important
that you understand the boundaries of that

77
00:04:10.614 --> 00:04:14.198
network cause you want to get everybody
inside that particular maybe it's a formal

78
00:04:14.198 --> 00:04:16.526
unit or division or
department of the organization.

79
00:04:16.526 --> 00:04:18.805
Maybe it's a particular
geographical location,

80
00:04:18.805 --> 00:04:22.091
I wanna survey everybody in the New York
office and the Michigan office and

81
00:04:22.091 --> 00:04:25.061
the Shanghai office and
maybe it's the communities of practice.

82
00:04:25.061 --> 00:04:28.217
I want everybody who belongs to that
particular community of practice,

83
00:04:28.217 --> 00:04:29.550
maybe it's cohorts.

84
00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.610
I want the more senior executives, or

85
00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.800
I want people who have been here between
five and ten years in the organization,

86
00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.080
maybe it's a particular set of
teams that you want to survey.

87
00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.190
So you need to figure out who
is it that you want to survey,

88
00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:41.710
what are the boundaries of that sample.

89
00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.330
The second element for a network survey
is you want to be very careful about

90
00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.670
the number of people
inside those boundaries,

91
00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:52.120
the number of people in the sample.

92
00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.660
You don’t want too few really
because there’s not much point so

93
00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:55.630
you don’t really want,

94
00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:59.660
if you’re doing a network survey of less
than 25 people you're usually gonna pretty

95
00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:03.050
much know who collaborates with whom if
you know anything about that unit already.

96
00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.252
You don't necessarily need to go
through this whole in order to do it.

97
00:05:07.252 --> 00:05:10.750
So if it's a very small sample it
might not be worth the effort, but

98
00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.550
you also have to be very careful on the
other side that the sample isn't too large

99
00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.720
because we're gonna look in a minute
how you ask network questions.

100
00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.230
But essentially, what you're doing is
you're asking people to report on their

101
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:25.950
ties with every single other person in the
sample, so 300 is already a lot of people.

102
00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:29.100
If you're getting above 300 you're
asking people to report on 299 plus

103
00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:33.080
other people that they interact with and
that's just very time consuming.

104
00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.860
It's the kind of thing people
don't like doing in a survey.

105
00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.160
They'll stop answering the survey and
you won't have any data.

106
00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.959
So you really need to watch that
the sample doesn't get too large.

107
00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.070
Now, in terms of creating the survey,
again, a lot of this is stuff that if you

108
00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:48.805
have designed surveys before,
you'll know already.

109
00:05:48.805 --> 00:05:53.220
But you wanna be very careful to write
a good opening statement where you

110
00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:56.880
explain what the purpose of the survey
is also very important in network survey

111
00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.820
because you are asking about people's
interactions by name with others.

112
00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:04.780
To preserve confidentiality and
a sure people that if they report on their

113
00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:07.280
relationship with somebody else it's
not gonna get to somebody else.

114
00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:10.880
You need to design network questions, and

115
00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.570
I'm gonna come to that in a little
bit more detail in a second.

116
00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:14.310
You need to think about what

117
00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:16.460
other questions you want
beyond the network questions.

118
00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:20.710
Maybe you wanna know about people's rank,
or about their ambitions, or

119
00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:24.410
about whether they wanna leave
the organization within a few years.

120
00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:27.580
Whatever other questions you wanna ask,
you need to think very carefully,

121
00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.740
as in all surveys, about the order of
the questions and how they're formatted.

122
00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:35.030
You need to test and refine
the survey before you send it out and

123
00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:38.660
as with most surveys, you wanna
keep it to 10 to 15 minutes or so.

124
00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:41.990
It's very easy for network surveys to
get very long, because again you're

125
00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:45.370
asking people to report on their
relationships with lots of other people.

126
00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:48.270
But trying to keep it to not more
than 15 minutes is really gonna

127
00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:50.170
help your response rates.

128
00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:53.870
Let me just say a quick word on the next
slide about the network questions,

129
00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:57.310
cuz this is obviously the harder of what
the kind of data you're trying to collect

130
00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:59.140
in a network survey.

131
00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:03.520
So when you're asking network questions,
as I sort of already indicated,

132
00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:07.450
you are asking the persons responding
to the survey, to talk about or

133
00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:10.520
report on their relationships with
everybody else in the sample.

134
00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:14.274
So here's just an example of
what that would look like for

135
00:07:14.274 --> 00:07:17.630
the 15 member product development
team that we've been looking at.

136
00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:19.000
So, this network question says,

137
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.310
below is a list of all the members of your
product development team, how frequently

138
00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:25.501
do you go to each of these individuals to
seek information related to your work.

139
00:07:25.501 --> 00:07:28.615
And so if you take Alex,
Alex is gonna have to report and

140
00:07:28.615 --> 00:07:33.420
fill in one of those bubbles for Ali, for
Bill, for Carl, for David, and so on and,

141
00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:35.759
this is fine if it's a 15 member team.

142
00:07:35.759 --> 00:07:37.959
If it's 25 people it's
already quite a lot,

143
00:07:37.959 --> 00:07:41.050
if you're talking about 300
people it's really a lot.

144
00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:45.520
So when I've done network surveys inside
organizations, the largest I've done has

145
00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:50.010
been about 280, and usually we try to
whittle that number down pretty fast and

146
00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:52.020
say, well just report on your
most important relationships, and

147
00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:54.170
then let me ask you more
questions about that.

148
00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:57.560
So there's ways you can handle this, but
keeping an eye on the number of people

149
00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.910
that you're asking about their
networks is gonna be very important.

150
00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:05.050
Okay, so back to the stages,
the third stage is to administer and

151
00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:05.880
monitor the survey.

152
00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:09.720
Again, this is not rocket science it
really helps to have a cover note

153
00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:13.690
from a senior sponsor saying
why we're doing the survey,

154
00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:17.030
we really want you to fill it in, thinking
carefully about the timing of the survey.

155
00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:19.130
Are you sending it out at a time
when people are actually gonna

156
00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:20.920
be able to respond to it?

157
00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:24.660
But the piece I want to emphasize here is
sort of the incentives and the need for

158
00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:26.320
a high response rate.

159
00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:29.360
So for
a network survey it's very important

160
00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:31.030
to have a very high response rate.

161
00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:35.400
So there's many kinds of surveys
you can do where, if you get a 10,

162
00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.610
15, 20% response rate you're
gonna be happy, right?

163
00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:41.530
Climate surveys and organizations for
example, but in a network survey,

164
00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:43.360
that's nowhere near good enough.

165
00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:44.330
So in a network survey,

166
00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:47.470
because you're trying to map everybody's
connections with each other,

167
00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:51.130
if you don't have half the people
responding you're not gonna know what

168
00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:55.610
those people's networks are at all right,
you're gonna have a big gap in your data.

169
00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:58.960
So the sort of rule of thumb
is probably you need at least

170
00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:01.810
around 80% response rate for
a survey to be successful and for

171
00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:05.480
the data to be really good,
good enough to do network analysis on.

172
00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:08.810
So that means you've gotta really
think about these timing issues,

173
00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:12.650
the sponsorship issues and maybe
offering some kinds of incentives for

174
00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:14.450
people to respond to the survey.

175
00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:19.470
So in a recent survey that we did, that
I did with my research team for example,

176
00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:23.340
we looked at, we actually offered
incentives in the form of if you fill in

177
00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:26.017
the survey and return it on time.

178
00:09:26.017 --> 00:09:31.790
We'll give $5 to Special Olympics and
so it can be something, current event,

179
00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:35.170
it can be something that the
organization's invested in at the time.

180
00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:37.760
People sometimes do, we'll put your
name in a hat and you'll win an iPad, so

181
00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:40.020
there's lots of possibilities here.

182
00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:43.840
But, because response rates are so
important, thinking creatively about this

183
00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:46.779
might be more important perhaps than
it is for some other kinds of surveys.

184
00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:52.410
And then the last element in terms of
collecting network data by surveys,

185
00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:55.850
is you know once you get the data in, so
once you got all the surveys returned,

186
00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:58.760
you collate, clean, and enter
the data as you would for any survey.

187
00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:01.870
Very often for
network data we do this in Excel, and

188
00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:05.450
we create that kind of spreadsheet
that the matrix looks a lot like

189
00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:07.960
the one that I just showed you earlier.

190
00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:12.620
Once you've got it in Excel,
you can use network

191
00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:17.230
data analysis packages to analyze this
data and, I'm not gonna go into them here,

192
00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:22.020
it's a whole another module at least
and, possibly a whole course by itself.

193
00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:26.380
To understand how to analyze the data using
the available software packages, but,

194
00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:30.080
at this point I'll just say that you
can buy or you can sometimes get for

195
00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:34.300
free visualization packages that will
help you to plot those networks so

196
00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:37.680
the giant fuzzy hairball plotting that
by hand is more or less impossible.

197
00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:40.630
You get data packages that
will help you do that, and

198
00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:42.760
to analyze the data and run the metrics.

199
00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:44.130
For example, the measures of density and

200
00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:48.780
centrality that we were talking about on
the network data using specific packages.

201
00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:52.900
Some of the best known are UCINET and
Netdraw to help analyze and

202
00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:54.640
visualize the data.

203
00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:01.380
So again, where that gets us to hopefully
is this matrix in Excel that tells us who,

204
00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:05.090
and in this case information from whom,
and then we can use that data,

205
00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:08.409
analyze that data using these packages.

206
00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:15.560
So collecting network data via surveys is
the most common way in which it's done,

207
00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:19.010
but there are some drawbacks that
it's important to be aware of.

208
00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:23.890
The pros are that you can ask exactly what
questions you want from your sample and

209
00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:26.940
get customized and
quite detailed specific information.

210
00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:30.700
But on the con side, the issues that
I've already mentioned just underscore,

211
00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:34.640
you've gotta have high response rates,
the network can't be too large,

212
00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:35.950
you can't make the survey too long.

213
00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:37.940
You can't ask everything you
want to ask in the world,

214
00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:39.920
you've got to kind of decide
what you really need to ask.

215
00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:44.050
You have to be very careful in terms
of how you word the questions and

216
00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:46.980
how you interpret the questions, cause
in any survey this is the case, right?

217
00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:50.880
If you ask people a specific question,
who do you seek information from?

218
00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:53.840
Do you wanna ask them only about
information related to the tasks?

219
00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:56.560
Do you wanna ask them about
other kinds of advice?

220
00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:59.220
Just understanding exactly what you're
asking and what people are gonna be

221
00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:01.790
thinking when they answer that question
is gonna make a big difference for

222
00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:05.780
you actually understand and be able to
take action based on what they say.

223
00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:08.970
Confidentiality, again very important
because you're asking people to

224
00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:10.720
report on each other by name.

225
00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:12.690
And this is, like many surveys,

226
00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:14.660
is a relatively costly
method of data collection.

227
00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:18.310
Takes a lot of time and
attention to develop a network survey and

228
00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:21.690
administer it, so
what are our other options?

229
00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:25.980
Well there are other sources that
we can get network data from and

230
00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:29.600
just to list some of them here, but there
may be others that you are already aware

231
00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:32.110
of and certainly there's others
coming on line all the time.

232
00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:36.330
Probably, the biggest other source right,
that is sort of

233
00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:40.400
everybody sort of thinking about
increasingly right now is big data, right.

234
00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:44.790
Because we suddenly have
all this access to what

235
00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:47.320
have been called the breadcrumbs
of our interactions, right?

236
00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:50.210
We leave behind breadcrumbs when
we interact with each other

237
00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:51.950
that can be used for other purposes.

238
00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:56.000
So when we correspond by email,
or by phone, conferencing,

239
00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.830
videoconferencing, sometimes when we
answer questions on bulletin boards, or

240
00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:02.330
we interact via social media,
each of those interactions,

241
00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:06.420
there's huge data sets available that you
can use to generate network maps, right?

242
00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:10.790
Because those are dyadic interactions
between people, you can use that,

243
00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:13.960
you can put that into a matrix exactly
like the one we were just looking at for

244
00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:16.590
the 15 person development team and

245
00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:21.320
apply network methods to understand
that and analyse that data.

246
00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:27.170
So big data is a big opportunity to
collect network data, there are also

247
00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:31.780
archival records from, offered from inside
organizations, some of the research I do.

248
00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:35.430
We go and get proprietary information that
organizations are willing to share with

249
00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:40.260
us, on things like how people
work together in the past,

250
00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:43.940
have they worked on common projects,
do they go to the same school,

251
00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:49.050
do they go to similar events
anything that is a proxy,

252
00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:53.140
if not a direct measure of much
they might have interacted.

253
00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:57.690
So, those are corporate databases, you can
also use public databases sometimes to get

254
00:13:57.690 --> 00:13:59.860
again, measures of how
much people collaborate.

255
00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:02.790
A lot of work is being done, a lot of
research is being done on patenting.

256
00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:05.830
So, people patent together or
they co-author or

257
00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:08.580
they, there are co-citations
to their manuscripts,

258
00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:11.520
those are all sort of interactions
of some kind between those people.

259
00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:15.390
And then finally,
the sort of more field-intensive,

260
00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:18.060
really going out there and trying to
collect data from people as they're

261
00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:21.705
interacting you can observe people
as they're working together,

262
00:14:21.705 --> 00:14:25.585
you can ask people to keep diaries of
who they're talking to and how much.

263
00:14:25.585 --> 00:14:29.173
And sometimes you can even have people
wear electronic tags that monitor who

264
00:14:29.173 --> 00:14:31.696
they're talking to as they
walk down the corridor and

265
00:14:31.696 --> 00:14:35.022
each of those those can provide the basis,
can provide network data.

266
00:14:35.022 --> 00:14:39.012
They can all provide this dyadic data
about who interacting with whom.

267
00:14:39.012 --> 00:14:42.407
Now often, you don't know exactly what's
going on in that interaction, but

268
00:14:42.407 --> 00:14:44.991
they do let you know that some
interactions are happening.

269
00:14:44.991 --> 00:14:49.200
So network data from other sources such
as these has some advantages, right?

270
00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:52.860
Sometimes particularly with the big data,
you can get information on much larger

271
00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:55.040
networks than you can
get through a survey.

272
00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:57.780
It's less invasive, you're often
not asking people for anything,

273
00:14:57.780 --> 00:15:00.260
it may be less expensive
if it's available anyway.

274
00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:03.310
And maybe it's more objective measures
than asking people in a survey to report

275
00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:05.740
what they're doing, hey you actually have,
oh well they emailed each other,

276
00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:06.369
I know they did something.

277
00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:09.660
But on the negative side or
on the con side,

278
00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:14.290
there are serious privacy concerns about
using some of these kinds of data.

279
00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:18.340
And if you have measures that are kind
of proxy's we don't necessarily know,

280
00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:21.080
we may know the people are emailing each
other, we don't necessarily know whether

281
00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:23.650
it's about work or maybe it's about
their social life or their kids.

282
00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:24.980
It could be anything, right?

283
00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:27.420
So maybe it's not such a good measure
unless you start looking at the content of

284
00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:29.000
that interaction.

285
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.750
And then finally, these large data sets
are very promising but as we know large

286
00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:36.160
data sets can often generate
a statistically significant findings that

287
00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:39.060
look like there's something there but they
just don't, they're not that big effect.

288
00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:41.400
They don't really matter that much.

289
00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:44.900
So these other sources have some
disadvantages as well as some advantages

290
00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:47.160
that are worth noting too.

291
00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:50.360
So that is it for
mapping collaboration networks.

292
00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:53.870
I hope you have a good sense at least of
what the kind of data is that we're trying

293
00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:58.260
to collect when we map networks and
then how we can use that data to start

294
00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:01.620
generating network maps that we
can then analyze and interpret and

295
00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:02.340
go on to evaluate.
