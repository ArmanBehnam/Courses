1
00:00:04.106 --> 00:00:07.411
So let's start off by talking
about the basics of collaboration,

2
00:00:07.411 --> 00:00:11.990
make sure we're all on the same page in
terms of what we mean by collaboration.

3
00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:16.350
So there's lots of different words
associated with the idea of collaboration.

4
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.160
The definition that we're gonna
be working with in this module

5
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.160
is collaboration is about working with
others to produce or create something.

6
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.970
So this is a very broad
definition of collaboration.

7
00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.130
But let's focus a little bit because we
wanna focus particularly on collaboration

8
00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.160
inside organizations.

9
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.160
So our focus is gonna be on collaboration
between employees inside an organization.

10
00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.580
Now, why is collaboration important?

11
00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.070
Why should we care about
this topic at all?

12
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.560
Well if you've spent any time working
inside organizations you're gonna know you

13
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.040
gotta work with other people
to get things done right.

14
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.450
And so many large organizations
are currently very

15
00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.100
focused on trying to understand how to
get the people to work more effectively

16
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.550
together to make them all productive and
more successful in the workplace.

17
00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.770
Lots of different kinds of organizations,

18
00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.630
these are just some of the ones
that I've done research with.

19
00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.100
Or that have come out and said,
your collaboration is really,

20
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.480
really big deal for us and
there are many others like this.

21
00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.480
But all the way from
organizations like Microsoft

22
00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:22.076
to very different kinds of organizations
like The World Bank to McKinsey & Company.

23
00:01:22.076 --> 00:01:24.100
Consulting firms Saatchi & Saatchi.

24
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.260
Global advertising organization.

25
00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:31.010
Many organizations around the world have
at the core of what they try to do better.

26
00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.410
They say, we really need to
get better at collaboration.

27
00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.740
So this is an issue that's currently
facing organizations, small and

28
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.280
large, across the world.

29
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.250
So the big question that we're really
gonna be focussing on in this module is,

30
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.280
how can we improve collaboration
inside organizations?

31
00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.610
So that's ultimately the goal
that we wanna be moving towards.

32
00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:58.020
But I'm gonna break this down into four
main areas that we're gonna work through,

33
00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.400
through the four segments that are gonna
follow this one in this module.

34
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.600
The first question is how can we describe
collaboration patterns between employees?

35
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.300
So okay,

36
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.120
collaboration matters, what terminology
can we use to talk about collaboration?

37
00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.760
And how can that help us to
understand whether we're good or

38
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.820
bad at collaboration
inside our organization?

39
00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.250
The second question is,

40
00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.950
how can we map the collaboration patterns
inside a particular organization?

41
00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.410
Right, so we have some ways to describe
collaboration networks but can we

42
00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.720
actually figure out who's collaborating
with whom inside our organization.

43
00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.020
Then, how do we evaluate
collaboration patterns?

44
00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.430
So maybe we know who's
collaborating with whom.

45
00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.320
But is it good or bad, right?

46
00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.200
What is it that makes this
form of collaboration good?

47
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.010
Why might it be problematic?

48
00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.760
And then the last question is, okay.

49
00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.240
If we've discovered that there's some
areas that are really concerning.

50
00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.340
Are not going so
well from a collaboration point of view.

51
00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.010
How can we improve these
collaboration patterns?

52
00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.980
So these are the four questions.

53
00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.637
Again, companies are really
concerned about them and

54
00:02:55.637 --> 00:02:58.708
we're gonna be thinking about
as we work through this module.

55
00:02:58.708 --> 00:03:02.050
Now, where does people analytics come in,
right?

56
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.920
People analytics, just a broad definition,

57
00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.690
is a data-driven approach
to managing people at work.

58
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.360
So we're gonna try to use data and
analytical techniques to understand and

59
00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.590
address those four questions
that we just laid out.

60
00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.330
Now here's the thing that I really

61
00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:23.680
want to introduce as the way to think
about collaboration inside organizations.

62
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.370
We have a very powerful set of tools and
techniques

63
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.080
that can be used to analyze collaboration
inside organizations that are called, or

64
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.340
that come out of the rubric, or

65
00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.730
come out of the broad platform of
organizational network analysis, right.

66
00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.700
And organizational network analysis is
a set of tools and techniques that can

67
00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.310
be used to evaluate and ultimately improve
collaboration inside organizations.

68
00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:54.360
So let's just take a quick look at what
an organizational network can look like.

69
00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.100
And I'm gonna use this example throughout.

70
00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.030
So you're gonna see it many times.

71
00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.840
But here's an example of
an organizational network.

72
00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.430
So this is a real network that comes
from a new product development team,

73
00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.490
this is a team with 15 members.

74
00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:12.970
As you can see, each member is represented
by a dot, and these members happen to come

75
00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.890
from three different functional
areas within this organization.

76
00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:20.030
There are some from marketing, some from
finance, some from manufacturing, and

77
00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:24.830
what this network is showing us is
who seeks information from whom.

78
00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.870
A one headed arrow means that I
seek information from that person

79
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.720
The two headed arrow means,
I seek information from that person and

80
00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.800
they seek information from me.

81
00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:34.430
Right, so

82
00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.700
this is an organizational network that can
help us to understand the interactions

83
00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:43.340
with the kinds of collaborations that
are happening inside an organization.

84
00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.760
So this is the set of, we're gonna learn
much more about this as we go forward.

85
00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.110
As a way to understand
collaboration inside firms.

86
00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.550
So when we go back to our four questions
how do we describe Map evaluate,

87
00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.540
improve collaboration patterns.

88
00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.060
We're gonna use these tools and
techniques that come from

89
00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.120
organizational network analysis
to address these questions and

90
00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.310
to give us some insight into
the answers to these questions
