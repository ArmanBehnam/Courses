WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.560
So at this point, we have some good
insights into the building blocks

2
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.630
that we can use to describe
collaboration that works.

3
00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.250
We have learned how to map collaboration
that works using survey methods or

4
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.690
possibly other kinds of data.

5
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:17.000
And we thought about how we can
evaluate collaboration networks,

6
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.950
both by looking at those collaboration
metrics or building blocks across

7
00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:25.380
individuals to compare them over time,
perhaps, and also by

8
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.510
connecting them to outcomes that we might
care about such as individual performance.

9
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.020
So, now that we fought about
how to evaluate in that works

10
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.440
we can move to that final
stage in our last segment,

11
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.550
which is to think about how to intervening
in collaboration that works right?

12
00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.800
How can we actually make a difference we
can see, we can map, we can evaluate,

13
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.040
we can understand them that
works inside the organization.

14
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:54.090
How can we actually improved them so,
that's the last stage So in terms

15
00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:00.110
of intervening in collaboration networks,
how can we improve collaboration patterns?

16
00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.270
Well there's some basic starting points,
right?

17
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:09.510
The very first thing to ask is always
is more collaboration actually needed?

18
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.700
Because it's very easy to say, look, those
people aren't connected into the network.

19
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.510
They don't collaborate very much.

20
00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.540
But that is not necessarily a bad thing.

21
00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.450
More collaboration is not always better,
because remember, the amounts of time that

22
00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.870
you're spending talking to other people,
asking them for information, asking them

23
00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.940
for help or advice, or knowledge, or
having them come to you and ask you for

24
00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.910
help, advice, knowledge, those things
are not always a good use of your time.

25
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.310
Sometimes they can really improve things,
but not for everybody and

26
00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:35.600
not all the time.

27
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.400
So the first question really is,

28
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.310
is more collaboration actually
needed if we see a gap in a network.

29
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:41.500
Is it a gap we want to fill?

30
00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.360
Then the next question becomes where
is more collaboration needed okay?

31
00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.510
So if there is a gap in the network or
more likely there are multiple gaps in

32
00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.870
the network, places where there
aren't ties between people.

33
00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.100
Do we actually need a tie
in that particular place?

34
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.530
So thinking about how to
build ties strategically,

35
00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.570
not just trying to get everybody
to collaborate more again, but

36
00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.740
trying to figure out who are the most
important people who need to be connected.

37
00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.025
And very often they they're the people
who are bridges between different

38
00:02:09.025 --> 00:02:12.605
parts of the network, or could be bridges
and perhaps aren't when they should be.

39
00:02:12.605 --> 00:02:15.385
So often you'll see network structures
that look pretty clustered.

40
00:02:15.385 --> 00:02:18.535
Everybody in a particular unit talks to
each other, everybody in another unit

41
00:02:18.535 --> 00:02:22.285
talks to each other, but are there
any connections between those units?

42
00:02:22.285 --> 00:02:25.365
And that very often is a strategic
opportunity where you need, or

43
00:02:25.365 --> 00:02:28.439
could benefit from building
more collaborative ties.

44
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.690
But identifying those opportunities
carefully is going to be very important.

45
00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.830
And then the third part becomes,
well, how to increase collaboration.

46
00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.730
Okay, we think we need more ties there,
we need more bridging connections, but

47
00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.380
how should we go about doing that?

48
00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.790
And essentially there's two main ways.

49
00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.690
And I'm just going to give some very
top-line sense of this right now, but

50
00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.060
obviously you can think about
this in much more detail for

51
00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.040
the particular situations
that you might be faced with.

52
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.760
One is, you need to provide people
with a motivation to build ties.

53
00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.540
And very often for senior leaders in
the organization that's going to be,

54
00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.420
we really just need to call attention to,

55
00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.020
we need to emphasize how important
collaboration is for our organization.

56
00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.640
And why it's important and
emphasize that we want to promote it.

57
00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.970
It could also be the case that you
want to explicitly recognize and

58
00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.620
reward collaboration.

59
00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.500
And so firms that really care about
this are increasingly building criteria

60
00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.530
into their performance evaluation
systems to say how much are you actually

61
00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.940
helping your colleagues beyond the strict
requirements of your own work?

62
00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.250
And they'll use that as part of
the performance evaluation system.

63
00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.660
So actually rewarding collaboration
if you really want people to do it,

64
00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:35.470
it's going to be important.

65
00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.490
And then, the other set of things
is around providing opportunities

66
00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:42.520
to build ties, right,
because it's all very well turning people.

67
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.760
We want you to build those ties, but the
more opportunities you can give people,

68
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.560
and usually that's in the form of exposure
to each other, right, how can you give

69
00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.260
people more exposure, more opportunities
to get to know each other, and

70
00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.770
to build those kind of trust,
and build relationship.

71
00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:59.540
And so it may be that you need some
more meetings in-between different

72
00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.260
processes and
functions in the organization.

73
00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.960
Maybe you can use conference calls,
things where people can see

74
00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.750
each other often are very important and
maybe video conferencing.

75
00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.540
Maybe you actually go all the way
to have people rotate jobs,

76
00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.280
spend some times in different parts or
the organization, or

77
00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.370
just to have them visit different sites
if it's a geographically dispersed

78
00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.280
organization, maybe organize events
where people can come together.

79
00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.080
So opportunities for

80
00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.700
people to build those ties, in addition to
the motivation to build them, are going to

81
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.134
be really valuable if you want to try
to build more collaborative ties.

82
00:04:28.134 --> 00:04:37.070
These are examples that are going to
apply in many different situations.

83
00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:41.060
But what I want to do for the remainder
of the segment is to give you five more

84
00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:46.660
specific examples of interventions
in collaboration networks that

85
00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:52.170
organizations have actually undertaken on
the basis of network kinds of analysis.

86
00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:57.110
Now the network analyses that they've used
are often more sophisticated and use more,

87
00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:58.970
different questions from the ones
that we've been looking at,

88
00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.450
which are simply kind of who goes
to each other for information.

89
00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:05.330
But, as a result,
its the same basic methodology, and

90
00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.650
I just want to give you a flavor and
a feel for what these network tools and

91
00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:13.730
techniques can enable you to do to improve
collaboration inside organizations.

92
00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:17.800
So I'm going to work through each
of these five examples in turn.

93
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.720
And what you'll see is that in one case
the implication was that we could reduce

94
00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.100
employee overload.

95
00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.810
The second was making global
teams more resilient.

96
00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.970
The third was reducing
inefficiencies in collaboration.

97
00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:30.860
Fourth is trying to get rid of silos or

98
00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:34.820
reduce silos or big divisions between
different parts of the organization.

99
00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:39.410
And the last is trying to enhance career
paths for people inside the organization.

100
00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:41.590
So many different ways
in which these tools and

101
00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:45.930
techniques around organizational network
analysis can turn out to be valuable for

102
00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:48.570
improving aspects of collaboration.

103
00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:50.225
So I want to work through
each of these in turn.

104
00:05:52.441 --> 00:05:54.922
Reducing employee overload, so

105
00:05:54.922 --> 00:06:00.250
there's a lot of detail actually on
all five of these slides coming up.

106
00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:03.430
And I don't expect you to really go
into great detail trying to understand

107
00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:05.260
what exactly is in this chart and why.

108
00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.560
Again, I just want you to get
the basic idea and the feel for

109
00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:11.880
what these kinds of
methods can help us to do.

110
00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:13.930
So this is a financial
services organization.

111
00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:17.750
It's real data from a network
study in a financial organization.

112
00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:22.980
And, what they were looking at here,
is they asked people how

113
00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:28.650
effective do you think everybody else in
this sample is as a source of information.

114
00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:29.720
So person one, two, three, four,

115
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:33.280
five report on how effective they
are as a source of information, and

116
00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:36.730
tell me whether you want more
access to this particular person.

117
00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:40.920
So those are the network questions that
they asked In exactly the way that we were

118
00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:44.470
talking about when we talked about
how to map collaboration network.

119
00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:48.860
And then they were able to plot how
effective people were as a source of

120
00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:52.920
information against a number of people
who wanted to access those people more.

121
00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:55.090
Again, don't need to worry too
much about the details, but

122
00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:58.750
what you see when you do this kind of
analysis is that there are a small

123
00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:02.670
number of people who add a lot of value in
terms of collaboration in an organization.

124
00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:03.850
And this is very common.

125
00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:07.430
We often see numbers like this,
around 5% of the people account for

126
00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:11.050
up to 35% of the value-added
collaborations.

127
00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:14.390
So people basically in the top
right hand corner of this chart

128
00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:17.600
are really highly in demand,
they are considered very effective and

129
00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.620
lots of people want more of their time.

130
00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:23.370
But the problem for those people,
as they discovered in this financial

131
00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:26.600
services organization, once it identified
them through this analysis, they went and

132
00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:29.360
talked to them and said, well,
how's this going for you?

133
00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:32.260
And what they found was that those
people really felt very overloaded.

134
00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.770
So they had a lot of people
who were coming to them, and

135
00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:36.620
who wanted more of their time, right?

136
00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:37.580
And that's very problematic.

137
00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:41.490
You have these super valuable people
who are also feeling really overloaded.

138
00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:44.430
You're really likely to lose
these people to competitors

139
00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:46.620
if you're not careful, right?

140
00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:48.680
So what this analysis
enabled these people,

141
00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:53.490
this organization to do was to figure out
well these are the very overloaded people,

142
00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:57.570
but there's also some people revealed by
this diagram who are considered effective

143
00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:02.420
sources of information but
who aren't utilizing nearly as much.

144
00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:05.790
And so what they did was try to identify
those well regarded employees who

145
00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:09.750
are relatively under utilized and try
to shift some of the burden to them and

146
00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:12.500
say well can you take on
some of the responsibility

147
00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:15.490
of handling the kinds of questions,
and the kind of approaches

148
00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:20.500
that these very over-burdened people
are getting all the time on their plates.

149
00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:25.700
So, this was an opportunity to reduce
employee overload by rebalancing

150
00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:29.020
collaboration demands from the people
who are really overloaded to people that

151
00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:30.100
aren't quite as overloaded.

152
00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:36.160
The second illustration is about
improving the resiliency of global teams.

153
00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:37.050
Okay.

154
00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:40.140
And what they were doing here
is through a network analysis,

155
00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:43.680
they were able to identify which
people were really peripheral and

156
00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:45.450
who needed to be connected better.

157
00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:49.620
So, again, this was a multinational
agribusiness company.

158
00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:55.810
So, a real large organization has
global IT teams from around the world.

159
00:08:55.810 --> 00:08:58.720
And, what they did was
they mapped the networks

160
00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:01.730
in exactly the same way
we've been mapping them here

161
00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:05.990
with between the team members
in each of these global teams.

162
00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:08.400
And, what they found,
kind of like we saw for

163
00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:12.130
our new product development team that
had 15 people with Kevin out there

164
00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:15.500
on the edge, is that there were some
people who were very disconnected.

165
00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:16.270
Right?

166
00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:19.370
And so what this analysis enabled this

167
00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:22.140
multinational company to do was try
to identify who those people were,

168
00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:26.200
and to really work hard to connect
them into the organization.

169
00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:27.655
And of course this is
much more problematic,

170
00:09:27.655 --> 00:09:29.050
because these are globally
distributed teams, so

171
00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:30.860
these people are probably
in different countries.

172
00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:34.540
So you've really got to figure out how to
help them build ties that connect them

173
00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:36.460
into the rest of the team.

174
00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:39.280
This analysis again, allowed them to
figure out who exactly needed to be

175
00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:43.490
connected, and how they could be
connected to make it most efficient.

176
00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:48.140
Which connections would have the biggest
positive impact on team connectivity.

177
00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:50.940
And to ask people to take more
responsibility to build those kinds of

178
00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:51.780
ties, specifically.

179
00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:58.570
So, the third illustration of
an intervention that one organization took

180
00:09:58.570 --> 00:09:59.770
was an interesting one.

181
00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:03.360
It was about reducing collaboration
inefficiencies, in this case,

182
00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:04.870
through targeted coaching.

183
00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:07.280
So, this was a major utility company.

184
00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:09.400
And they realized that some of their
people probably just weren't very

185
00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:11.650
good at collaborating,
although they were trying.

186
00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:16.090
And so what they did they asked employees
how much time they spent interacting

187
00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:20.080
with each other, and
how useful those interactions were.

188
00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:24.080
And then again I don't expect you to
really deal with the details of this plot,

189
00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:26.840
but you can see these two axes
plotted against each other.

190
00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:32.200
So on the Y-axis, the vertical axis, the
average number of times that an individual

191
00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:34.780
was cited as a useful
source of information and

192
00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:37.820
on the X axis the average
interaction times.

193
00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:41.360
So what we see here is if a person is
really you know considered to be very

194
00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:45.410
useful, so up in the top bubble, and but

195
00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:49.170
not taking too much time to interact with,
that's pretty good.

196
00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:54.420
But people who are really high on
interaction time all the way on this

197
00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:59.680
little lower bubble and sort of so so
in terms of usefulness in interaction.

198
00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:02.620
Those people are being much
less effective, right?

199
00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:04.490
People who you are trying
to collaborate with, but

200
00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:07.790
it takes you a lot of time to collaborate
with them and it's not all that useful.

201
00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:10.260
It's not really worth that
time to collaborate with them.

202
00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.540
You gotta do something about those people,
because it's not really

203
00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:18.760
having as much benefit, the collaboration
is really kind of a wasted resource there.

204
00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:21.850
And so what they were able to do,
again, these were network questions,

205
00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:25.670
that asked for every single individual,
how useful is it to collaborate with them?

206
00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:27.720
How much time does it take
to collaborate with them?

207
00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:31.870
So it's a network analysis that
generated this kind of data plot.

208
00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:35.080
And as a result they were able to
identify the specific individuals that

209
00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:35.940
needed coaching.

210
00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:36.670
Right?
And

211
00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:40.815
to say well those people in that lower
bubble, who are taking too much time and

212
00:11:40.815 --> 00:11:43.050
arent' really valuable to interact with.

213
00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:46.520
Let's develop personalized coaching
plans for those people and

214
00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:49.880
help them to collaborate,
learn to collaborate more effectively.

215
00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:53.210
So targeted coaching is
an intervention that

216
00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:56.980
was generated through
this network analysis.

217
00:11:56.980 --> 00:12:00.130
The fourth illustration here
is about a company Money that

218
00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:04.410
worked on trying to eliminate, or
at least reduce organizational silos.

219
00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:07.540
So those big, we often see
organizations that have big divisions,

220
00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:10.170
there's just very little communication
between those divisions when they

221
00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:15.460
operate as silos by building
more across divisional ties.

222
00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:18.910
So this is data from
a Fortune 500 conglomerate.

223
00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:21.000
And this is a conglomerate
that had grown by acquisition.

224
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.240
So it was used to buying and
integrating new divisions.

225
00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:28.560
But the CEO and senior management where
very concerned that the, top executives,

226
00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:30.230
there are 126 of them.

227
00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:33.580
Basically weren't really collaborating as
much as they should across divisions, and

228
00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:34.640
if you're growing acquisitions,

229
00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:37.300
you kind of want synergies
across your different divisions.

230
00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:39.740
But some of them weren't
talking to each other at all.

231
00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:41.850
And so, they conducted a network analysis.

232
00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:45.550
And here the network analysis
was based on these 126 people

233
00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:47.670
all across this large conglomerate.

234
00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:50.540
And they asked how much
do you collaborate with

235
00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:53.859
people from these other divisions as well
as from people inside your own division.

236
00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:56.420
And here we see the raw data,

237
00:12:56.420 --> 00:13:00.620
in some sense this is a very simple
table that shows division one.

238
00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:04.280
The bold numbers are how much people
interact inside their division, and

239
00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:08.930
then the unbold numbers or the lighter
numbers are the numbers that show how much

240
00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:11.100
the senior executives interact
with upper divisions.

241
00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:14.370
And what this company
was able to do was say,

242
00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:16.190
well where are those
numbers really really low?

243
00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:19.190
In other words,
where are those divisions not

244
00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:23.320
collaborating very much at all with each
other, and is that a problem or is it

245
00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:26.290
something we would expect to see given
the nature of those particular divisions?

246
00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:29.780
Again, it's not the case that if you don't
see collaboration it's necessarily bad,

247
00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:33.240
maybe those divisions just don't need
to collaborate given what they do.

248
00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:36.510
But they were able to identify
a number of particular

249
00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:39.440
divisional pairs that should
have been collaborating more.

250
00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:42.960
So identifying target's specific network
connections that actually held strategic

251
00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:47.980
relevance for the firm, and then try to
intervene to build ties, encourage people,

252
00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:52.070
give people opportunities to build
ties across those divisions.

253
00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:56.430
And also, in this particular company, they
redid the network survey, and were able to

254
00:13:56.430 --> 00:14:01.900
track changes in these ties over time to
assess the impact of their interventions.

255
00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:06.200
So another possibility, another way to use
this network data, thinking about how to

256
00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:10.895
build bridges, eliminate, organizational
silos by building cross-divisional ties.

257
00:14:10.895 --> 00:14:13.405
And the last illustration here is

258
00:14:13.405 --> 00:14:17.335
one about enhancing career paths through
better performance management processes.

259
00:14:17.335 --> 00:14:21.825
So this is an illustration that
comes from a global consulting firm.

260
00:14:21.825 --> 00:14:25.665
And this was a company that mapped
the networks of its partners,

261
00:14:25.665 --> 00:14:27.555
it had about 80 partners.

262
00:14:27.555 --> 00:14:29.990
And what it did when it
mapped these networks

263
00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:34.180
was that it discovered that a lot of
departments were spending a lot of time

264
00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:37.970
doing some things that were very valuable
for the firm in terms of collaboration.

265
00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:40.870
They were working with others
to help them with their work.

266
00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:43.730
But those things that they were doing,
those collaborative activities,

267
00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:49.030
were not recognized at all in the firm's
performance management processes.

268
00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:52.250
In other words, partners are being
rewarded in terms of how much revenue

269
00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:54.620
they brought into the firm, but
they weren't being rewarded at all for

270
00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:57.360
collaborating with other partners.

271
00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:00.060
And in particular the network
analysis found two main

272
00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:03.000
ways that they were collaborating
that were really valuable.

273
00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.240
One was collaborating,

274
00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:08.600
other words, helping the other
partners in the firm to win clients.

275
00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:12.150
Obviously very important for the firm, but
it's not direct revenue production by me,

276
00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:13.410
so I wasn't getting the credit for

277
00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:17.070
it, but I'm helping other people do it,
which is very important for the firm.

278
00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:22.560
And helping other people, other partners
to collaborate to serve clients.

279
00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:27.670
So in otherwords, I'm sorry I'm
going to so, let's start again.

280
00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:32.040
So collaborating to win clients, but
also collaborating to serve clients.

281
00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:36.360
So in other words, you have a client and
somebody comes to me for advice and says,

282
00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:38.520
will you help me spend a little
time on this project and

283
00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:40.290
help me serve this client better.

284
00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:43.960
And if I spend that time It's
not direct revenue production.

285
00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:44.930
I'm not being rewarded for it.

286
00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:47.900
But of course helping that partner
serve their client better is also very

287
00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:49.440
valuable for the firm.

288
00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:53.750
So once the firm realized
through this network survey that

289
00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:57.755
partners were spending time doing this
valuable activity, valuable collaborative

290
00:15:57.755 --> 00:16:01.055
activities around serving and winning
clients, but they weren't being rewarded.

291
00:16:01.055 --> 00:16:04.125
They realized that they had to change
their performance management processes and

292
00:16:04.125 --> 00:16:08.485
their performance evaluation systems to
recognize the contributions of partners

293
00:16:08.485 --> 00:16:11.815
who helped others to win new clients or
to serve current clients.

294
00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:17.460
So those are five very
different illustrations

295
00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:20.740
of different ways in which
network analysis can be used.

296
00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:23.500
And once you've done all the data
collection and mapping and

297
00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:26.930
analysis and evaluation,
you've figured out what the problems are,

298
00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:29.850
what can you then do to make
improvements in your organization?

299
00:16:29.850 --> 00:16:33.680
All the way from just building ties
to changing performance management

300
00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:36.890
processes targeted coaching and so on.

301
00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:44.680
So in conclusion, we started off with
this big question at the beginning of

302
00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:49.569
this module how can we improve
collaboration inside organizations.

303
00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:57.570
And we worked our way through four main
elements of this overall question.

304
00:16:57.570 --> 00:17:02.020
We've thought about how can we describe
collaboration patterns between employees,

305
00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:05.740
how can we map these patterns,
how can we evaluate them, and

306
00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:09.140
how ultimately can we
intervene to improve them?

307
00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:11.810
And in order to do all this,
we've used the tools and

308
00:17:11.810 --> 00:17:14.930
techniques of organizational
network analysis.

309
00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:19.750
This is really a form of people analytics
where we're using tools and techniques

310
00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:24.600
that are very data-driven to try to
improve the way that we manage employees,

311
00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:28.330
and the way that employees work together
to get the work of the organization done.

312
00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:33.180
So when we think about using
people analytics to understand,

313
00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:37.830
evaluate collaboration inside
organizations, we can use the tools of

314
00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:43.910
organizational network analysis to go all
the way through this process of being able

315
00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:48.300
to describe what collaboration is actually
happening inside the organization, being

316
00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:52.570
able to map the collaboration networks
between people inside the organization,

317
00:17:52.570 --> 00:17:55.190
being able to evaluate and say,
well, is that good or is that bad?

318
00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:56.860
Do we like the way those
people are collaborating?

319
00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:58.570
Are they collaborating enough or
not enough and

320
00:17:58.570 --> 00:18:01.460
how it is affecting outcomes
that we care about.

321
00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:02.340
And finally,

322
00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:06.150
if we think we need to make changes there
are lots of possibilities for different

323
00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:10.340
kinds of interventions that can improve
collaboration inside the organization.

324
00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:13.300
All the way from making it more
efficient where it is happening

325
00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:17.850
to building collaborative ties that are
needed where it's not happening enough.

326
00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:22.110
So I hope you found this helpful in
starting to lay the groundwork for

327
00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:26.010
understanding how to use people analytics
to understand collaboration inside

328
00:18:26.010 --> 00:18:27.150
organizations.

329
00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:30.788
There's a lot more to go, this is just
the introduction and the basics and

330
00:18:30.788 --> 00:18:34.484
the foundations, but I think if you
have all of this under your belt you're

331
00:18:34.484 --> 00:18:37.124
going to know a lot have a very,
very firm foundation for

332
00:18:37.124 --> 00:18:39.999
building on as you go forward
with trying to understand and

333
00:18:39.999 --> 00:18:42.661
improve collaboration
inside your organizations.
