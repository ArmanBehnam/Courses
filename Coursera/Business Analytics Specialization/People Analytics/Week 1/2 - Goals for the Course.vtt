00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.140
So the basic goal of this course is
to introduce people to the major

2
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.130
areas of people analytics, and help them
to understand what it is as a field.

3
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.290
We can't promise that we're gonna
make you experts over the course

4
00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:13.100
of these few sessions.

5
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.560
What instead we want to do, is help you
understand what's going on here, and

6
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.110
if you want to move forward,
Get interested in this field,

7
00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:21.470
what skills do you need to know.

8
00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.500
Ultimately to be fully competent here,

9
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.260
there's a bunch of statistics
you should probably catch up on.

10
00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.830
Maybe even a certain amount of data
management expertise that you would know.

11
00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.050
We at least hope to provide
some sort of introduction.

12
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.850
And so
really we're gonna aim to do a few things.

13
00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.910
First of all,
we want to provide you some understanding

14
00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.350
of what are the main areas of
activity in people analytics today.

15
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.530
What are the main decisions that
are increasingly being informed by data?

16
00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.140
In order to help get a sense of that,

17
00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.400
we also want to provide some
sort of conceptual underpinning.

18
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.270
Both of kind of the general applications
of data to these decisions But

19
00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.180
also of the various different
decisions that we made.

20
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.410
What do we know about how
people behave in organizations

21
00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.250
that we need to include when
we do these sorts of analyses.

22
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:08.270
On top of that,

23
00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.480
we wanna give you some sense of how you
could actually go about doing this.

24
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.010
What kind of data are there within the
organization, which you could go out and

25
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.580
gather, to inform some of these decisions.

26
00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.880
And then how should you
think about analyzing it?

27
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.500
So, in part that to understanding
some of the pitfalls, okay,

28
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.170
what are the areas where people go wrong.

29
00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.660
And in addition, it's understanding
what the basics of getting it right and

30
00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.700
kind of a brief preview of what are some
of the most sophisticated areas where

31
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.300
people are introducing analytics and
was kind of some of the promise of that.

32
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.930
So those are our basic goals.
