1
00:00:05.331 --> 00:00:09.292
Before we drop into the meat of
the course here on people analytics and

2
00:00:09.292 --> 00:00:13.187
talk about details, and how and
why you should do these analytics,

3
00:00:13.187 --> 00:00:18.270
we want to give you a few examples of
firms that are using theses techniques.

4
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.310
The first is Teach for America.

5
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.850
Teach for America is an organization
that provides teachers to underserved,

6
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.190
underprivileged school
districts around the country.

7
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:30.150
They do this by hiring students straight
out of college and training them and

8
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.710
then putting them into these schools for
a couple of years.

9
00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.900
And they've been doing this for
14 or 15 years now.

10
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.460
An interesting thing about Teach For
America is this, you might be surprised,

11
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.580
but they're actually
very analytic savvy and

12
00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.790
they've been paying a lot of
attention to their hiring process and

13
00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.490
the performance of their teachers,
for years now.

14
00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:51.580
Specifically, they evaluate, they compare
their performance of teachers over time to

15
00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.770
the predictions they had when they hired
the person about how they would perform.

16
00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.660
They do this in order to
improve the hiring process.

17
00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.150
So they see tens of thousands
of applicants every year.

18
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.710
In recent years, they've seen 50 and
60,000 applicants.

19
00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.940
This leads to a funneled process,
where they vet the CDs, the resumes at one

20
00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.560
stage, they invite some of those to do a
phone interview, they invite some of those

21
00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.350
on site to do a face to face interview,
and then they hire some subset of those.

22
00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.393
By looking rigorously at who
makes it through the process and

23
00:01:21.393 --> 00:01:25.149
how good their assessments are in
comparison to what actually happens down

24
00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:28.382
the road, they've been able to
optimize this hiring process.

25
00:01:28.382 --> 00:01:32.855
They're much more efficient now
about bringing the right number from

26
00:01:32.855 --> 00:01:36.190
the resume level to
the phone interview level.

27
00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.720
And then the right percentage
of those to the on site,

28
00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.550
allowing them to make better decisions and
use their resources more efficiently.

29
00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.480
Another example is a little
bit less surprising.

30
00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.350
This example comes from one of the most
analytic savvy companies in the world,

31
00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.530
Google, who a few years ago also wanted
to evaluate their hiring practices.

32
00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.690
They were going through for
years, significant growth and

33
00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.610
spending considerable time within
the firm interviewing potential hires.

34
00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.450
They eventually decided, do these
interviews actually make any difference?

35
00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.670
They had read the literature which
raises the question about how diagnostic

36
00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.790
interviews really are and ran the numbers.

37
00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.030
What they found was they were not
very good at predicting interviews,

38
00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.520
were not very good at predicting
employee performance down the road.

39
00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.960
This is a real problem
whenever you're spending

40
00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.870
ten managers interview time on every
potential hire that comes through.

41
00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.980
As a result, they did something
that is very un Google like.

42
00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.430
They provided an edict from above
which they never do that said,

43
00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.990
you can't schedule more than four

44
00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.470
interviews with managers when you
have a potential hire come through.

45
00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.920
You just can't spend that amount of our
resources because we've run the numbers

46
00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.350
and it's not worth it.

47
00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.280
It's not worth,
the analytics say it's not worth it.

48
00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.060
Final example comes from
the financial services industry.

49
00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.150
This has been the industry probably second

50
00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.540
most enthusiastic about people
analytics after technology.

51
00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.630
And an example from Credit Suisse.

52
00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.310
Credit Suisse believes that a 1% increase
in their retention, if they can retain

53
00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.910
their employees, they can save the company
75 to $100 million dollars a year.

54
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.690
So financial services, one of the most
important assets is the people.

55
00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.630
They're going to try to retain their
best people a little bit longer and

56
00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.030
a little more effectively.

57
00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.780
They did this with a three year study,
looking at factors that

58
00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.050
led the people to leave the firm, or
led people to stay within the firm.

59
00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.960
One of the things they found,
one of the surprising results was that

60
00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:36.580
those who changed jobs internally were
more likely to stay with the firm.

61
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:37.610
They call this stickiness.

62
00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.630
They said changing jobs increases
an employee's stickiness.

63
00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:43.230
Once they identified that,

64
00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.660
they had some levers they could
pull to push for more stickiness.

65
00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:53.130
So for example, prior to that
analysis they had posted internally,

66
00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.080
less than 50% of the new
jobs that came up.

67
00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.950
But because of that analysis, they
realized we need to be placing our people,

68
00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.390
moving our people more rather
than letting them leave the firm.

69
00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:08.062
So they increased the postings to more
than 80% now of the new openings get

70
00:04:08.062 --> 00:04:12.077
posted internally, leading to
hundreds more internal hires and

71
00:04:12.077 --> 00:04:16.457
according to the models more sticky
employees, lower retention, and

72
00:04:16.457 --> 00:04:19.180
ultimately, higher earnings.

73
00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.170
Those are just three examples, there
are many, many others across industries.

74
00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:26.870
Firms and technology,
financial services, telecommunications,

75
00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.850
automotive, consumer packaged goods,
energy, Shell oil.

76
00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:32.824
You wouldn't know it,
lots of people analytics,

77
00:04:32.824 --> 00:04:35.142
not-for-profits, not only Teach for
America.

78
00:04:35.142 --> 00:04:38.620
They are finding better leverage for
retaining key employees,

79
00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.550
more diagnostic methods of hiring,
who their most valuable employees are,

80
00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.640
how to compose most productive teams,
and many other things.

81
00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.140
These are just some of examples.

82
00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:50.510
These should provide some motivation for
all of us to get better at this.

83
00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:52.800
Which is exactly why we
hope you're here and

84
00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.290
exactly what we want to talk about
as we go through the course.
