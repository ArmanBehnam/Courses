00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.020
The fourth and
final issue we're gonna talk about

2
00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.028
on performance evaluation
is process versus outcome.

3
00:00:06.028 --> 00:00:13.280
And the first issue we want to add here
is that a firm ought to, and individuals

4
00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.350
ought to consider a broader set of
objectives than they typically consider.

5
00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.410
So organizations usually care
not just about what happens,

6
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.740
but how it happens,
how a person goes about their job.

7
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.200
So for example, perhaps most importantly,
along the way to creating some outcome,

8
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.660
what impact did that employee
have on other employees?

9
00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.750
What impact did they have on others.

10
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.320
Can you fold that into
the performance evaluation as well.

11
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.050
This just highlights that
we tend to care more,

12
00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.900
we care about more things than just
what is traditionally measured.

13
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.030
And, so one prescription that comes
from it is to measure more things.

14
00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.900
An example of why we do this,
is research by.

15
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.920
Bond, Carlson and Keeney, they found that
people considered too few objectives.

16
00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.900
And this is in negotiation settings,
this is in decision making settings,

17
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.370
that you ask people what
they're trying to accomplish.

18
00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.460
They'll list a few objectives but
then if you ask others.

19
00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.450
They ask a large group and then you share
all the possible answers with people

20
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.370
will go back and say,
oh yeah, I forgot that.

21
00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:22.330
And I'll add that in the end, they listed
on their own something like about half of

22
00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.340
all the objectives they
ultimately recognize as relevant.

23
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.910
So, left to our own devices,
we're a little too casual,

24
00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:34.990
a little too informal about focusing on a
few narrow issues instead of a broad set.

25
00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.340
Now it can lead firms
to focus too narrowly.

26
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.500
An example of a firm that recognized this,

27
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.568
Dell Computers in the early 2000s,
famously hard-charging,

28
00:01:44.568 --> 00:01:48.170
famously results-oriented,
changed their performance evaluations.

29
00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.058
They changed from 100%
results-based to 50% results-based.

30
00:01:53.058 --> 00:01:55.415
What an employee accomplished.

31
00:01:55.415 --> 00:01:58.010
And 50% how he or she accomplished it.

32
00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.720
So they're judging not only
what the person does, but

33
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.110
their impact on other people, because they
had too much experience with managers that

34
00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.700
were running over people to hit
the numbers to get the bonus.

35
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.240
And in fact,

36
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.220
the firm cared about things other than
just the numbers that were being measured.

37
00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.780
In general the more uncertainty
there is in an environment,

38
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.260
the less control an employee
has over the exact outcomes.

39
00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.050
The more a firm should
emphasize process over outcome.

40
00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.620
So the more noise, the less control
the employee has the more they should be

41
00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.300
evaluated on process and not on outcome.

42
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:34.000
One way you can go about this,
is to use analytics to figure out

43
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.730
which processes tend to
produce the desired outcomes.

44
00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:39.580
And what you're looking for

45
00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.250
here is what's the more
fundamental driver of the outcome?

46
00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.110
It could be that you're measuring only
the last step in the process, and

47
00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.960
in fact there are some
important intermediate steps

48
00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.010
that are more fundamental, and they might
provide additional performance measures.

49
00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.790
So, for example, the sports analytics
world gives us an illustration of this.

50
00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.620
In hockey, for
a long time teams were evaluated,

51
00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.900
in fact players were evaluated,
based on goals.

52
00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.420
And if you were trying to figure out
whether a team was really good, or

53
00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.330
poor they'd look at the number
of goals they'd been scoring.

54
00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.950
If they wanted to evaluate
whether a player was strong or

55
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.440
weak, they would look at his contribution
to the goals scored while he was on ice.

56
00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.770
And this is fine, and
it's related, and it's important.

57
00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:22.940
But can you do better?

58
00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.160
It turns out there aren't
many goals scored in hockey.

59
00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.790
And sometimes they are scored,
because they hit the pole and

60
00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.600
went left when others aren't scored,
because they hit the pole and went right.

61
00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.750
They tip off of people's skates
all kinds of crazy things happens.

62
00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.940
There is a lot of noise between what a
player controls and what actually happens.

63
00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.640
And whenever there's that noise you
want to be careful about how much

64
00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:45.590
weight you put on it.

65
00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.550
It's not giving you a very reliable
signal for the true effort, or

66
00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:51.360
the true ability underneath it.

67
00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.580
So what do they do?

68
00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:59.290
They determined through analytics that a
better predictor was not goals, but shots.

69
00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.820
That if you looked at how many shots,
they call it shots on goal,

70
00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.710
shots that were hit, basically,
at the goal, at the net.

71
00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.120
That was a better predictor,
that was a more reliable measure.

72
00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.750
And one way to think about it is,
it's more persistent that a guy, or

73
00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:21.040
a player, or a team that looks
good in one period on shots,

74
00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.190
is more likely to look good
in the next period on shots.

75
00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.920
Than a player who looks good on goals,
is to look good on goals the next period.

76
00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.770
It's a more persistent,
more fundamental measure.

77
00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.140
Well you can take that even further they
subsequently realized what really matters

78
00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.710
is possession, it's not even shots.

79
00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.620
There's again so much noise on
shots that what the best measure

80
00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.340
they can find on team, or
player is contribution to possession.

81
00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.450
The teams that keep that puck,
the teams that have the puck,

82
00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:48.980
are the ones that
are most likely to shoot.

83
00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.490
The ones who are most likely to shoot
are most likely to score goals.

84
00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.880
But they had to figure that out going
backwards looking for the more and

85
00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.690
more fundamental measure, and you can
think of these as process measures.

86
00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:04.380
They're getting away from the noisy,
rare outcome measure of a goal,

87
00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:09.102
to the more fundamental more reliable
measure, process measure possession.

88
00:05:09.102 --> 00:05:12.790
What about non-hockey applications
you might reasonably ask?

89
00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:14.940
Well it's hard to come up with them,

90
00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.170
one I'd push you to think about what
that means for your organization,

91
00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:22.740
but one conversation I've had along
these lines is with sales organizations.

92
00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.000
Can they come up with more fundamental
measures than the traditional

93
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.650
dollars booked?

94
00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:32.640
Can you, for example, consider the process
that leads to that dollars booked.

95
00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:37.780
Is it the number of bids that
a salesperson gets her organization into?

96
00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:41.030
Or maybe before that,
is it the relationship building

97
00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:45.610
that the salesperson does in order to get
the bids in order to book the dollars?

98
00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:47.450
Or maybe even it's earlier than that.

99
00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:49.160
It's an earlier process yet.

100
00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.720
It's the number of contacts generated.

101
00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.610
And we don't know exactly which of
these would be most persistent.

102
00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:58.670
It will vary of course by organization and
by industry, but

103
00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:01.020
the idea is to take data to the problem.

104
00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:05.700
And determine where in the process
you might start adding assessments

105
00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:10.410
to get away from these relatively, rare
noisy outcome measures at the very least

106
00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:15.630
to supplement them with more fundamental
drivers earlier in the process.

107
00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:19.470
I wanna end this section with a quote from
Shane Battier, another sports example,

108
00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:21.130
another Michael Lewis example.

109
00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:24.860
This was an article written in
The New York Times Magazine

110
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:30.900
a few years ago, where Shane Battier
was playing for the Houston Rockets,

111
00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:35.910
and the Rockets were famously
users of data analytics.

112
00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:41.160
And Battier was famously a player,
who despite not having any obvious,

113
00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:46.090
flashy Stats, or
obvious skills hung around the NBA.

114
00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:47.370
Teams found him valuable, and

115
00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:50.600
he became even more valuable
when he went to the Rockets.

116
00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.780
They started looking at process,
they started coaching him on

117
00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:56.830
here's something you can do differently
that's gonna influence the game.

118
00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:58.020
If you defend a player, for

119
00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:01.740
example, this way you're gonna decrease
the likelihood that he makes the shot.

120
00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:03.410
If you play offense this way,

121
00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:08.680
if you attack the post in this way,
you're more likely to score.

122
00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:12.470
So it's always likelihood with the
Rockets, it's always likelihood in sports

123
00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:16.530
analytics, and it allowed Battier,
kind of freed him up to focus on what he

124
00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:21.070
knew was right, and not worry so much
about whether it happened to turn out well

125
00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:24.180
on any particular trip down the court,
or happened to turn out badly.

126
00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:26.950
On another trip down the court
he could focus on the process.

127
00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:29.210
He put it this way, knowing the odds,

128
00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:33.270
Battier can pursue an inherently
uncertain strategy with total certainty.

129
00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:35.300
He can devote himself to a process, and

130
00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:38.120
disregard the outcome
to any given encounter.

131
00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:41.890
This is critical, because in basketball,
as in everything else,

132
00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:45.300
luck plays a role and Battier cannot
afford to let it distract him.
