00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:06.160
So in this module we wanna talk about
performance evaluation, and as most of you

2
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.990
know from having worked in organizations
there are a couple of purposes.

3
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.450
One is rewards and punishment.

4
00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.940
Mostly firms tie rewards,
whether it's a raise or

5
00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.150
a bonus or sometimes a promotion to
some kind of performance evaluation.

6
00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:21.780
But also firms do this for feedback.

7
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:23.790
They want employees to
get better at their jobs.

8
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.950
This is a means of giving
that kinds of feedback.

9
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.100
The kind of feedback is necessary
to get better at your job.

10
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.790
But this is performance evaluation,
and we're gonna focus on performance

11
00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.640
evaluation as opposed
to talent management.

12
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.979
It's really tough to compare employees,
if they're not in identical situations.

13
00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:43.907
So we'll talk elsewhere in the people
analytics course about talent management

14
00:00:43.907 --> 00:00:45.820
and comparing employees.

15
00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.020
Right now, we really want to focus on
evaluating the performance management of

16
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.910
a given employee.

17
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.880
For this starting place for
this lecture and a little bit for

18
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.200
life you might think about beginning by
assuming all employees are equal ability.

19
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.200
That's a rough decent starting place.

20
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.420
For what we're gonna do here.

21
00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.300
Begin by assuming all
employees are equal ability.

22
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.510
And now, we're trying to figure
out how hard are they working and

23
00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.570
how can we improve them at their job.

24
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.280
So the fundamental challenge
in performance evaluation

25
00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.990
is that performance measures are noisy.

26
00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.840
Whatever means we wanna use for
evaluating how our employees performing is

27
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.120
imperfectly related to what their actually
doing with how hard they're working or

28
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.720
how smart they're working.

29
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.010
And that slippage is essentially noise.

30
00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.100
This is how a statistician
would think about it,

31
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.980
this is how an economist
would think about it.

32
00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.100
They're noise in the performance measures.

33
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.200
And this is gonna be a problem for
us if we're trying to infer from these

34
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.150
performance measures
something about the employee.

35
00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.580
You can think about it as
a normal distribution.

36
00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.210
So for any given level of effort,

37
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.910
you might see the performance measure line
up perfectly with that level of effort or

38
00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.480
you might see it come in a little high or
a little low.

39
00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.490
So a range of outcomes can occur due to
factors outside the employees control.

40
00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.470
So no matter how hard they work or
how smart they work they have competitors,

41
00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.772
they have team members, they have bosses,

42
00:02:07.772 --> 00:02:10.648
they have an economy that
they're interacting with.

43
00:02:10.648 --> 00:02:13.910
All of these things are outside
the employees control.

44
00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.450
So there's noise, there's slippage
between what the employee tries to do,

45
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.924
how hard they work,
how smart they work and

46
00:02:20.924 --> 00:02:24.669
the performance measure that
results as a consequence of that.

47
00:02:24.669 --> 00:02:27.729
So this is our challenge,
separating skill from luck.

48
00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:31.950
And for a person like me, this is
one of the great challenges in life.

49
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.560
You're forever trying to separate
from what we see how much is luck and

50
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.970
how much is skill?

51
00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.350
There's an economist at the University
of Chicago, John Huizinga.

52
00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:46.100
Who said recently in an interview, this
distinction between ascertaining skill and

53
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.370
luck shows up all the time.

54
00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.080
Who do you give your money to for
investing?

55
00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.110
How much do you pay a certain employee?

56
00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.810
It's everywhere.

57
00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.470
It isn't just about sports.

58
00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:55.500
It's about life.

59
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.153
So that's really what we are trying
to do here in this performance

60
00:02:58.153 --> 00:02:59.029
evaluation module.

61
00:02:59.029 --> 00:03:00.980
We are trying to separate skill from luck.

62
00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.450
You might think of it
as signal verses noise.

63
00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.370
We wanna understand the true signal,

64
00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.760
even though we only get
noisy performance measures.

65
00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.860
So in southern environments this isn't so
hard.

66
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:18.530
For example, in this picture I've
shown two normal distributions and

67
00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:24.110
you can think of this as what might result
if an employee gives high effort or

68
00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:25.910
if the employee gives low effort.

69
00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.270
And we're gonna use for our simple
model here, we're gonna use effort, but

70
00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:31.410
that's just a simplification.

71
00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.670
You can think of this as working smart.

72
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.700
You can think of this,
you can even though we wanna avoid for

73
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.690
the moment thinking of this as being
a high talent versus low talent.

74
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.450
So for the moment let's just
think of it as high effort.

75
00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.130
Are they working hard or
are they not working hard?

76
00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.460
In the world I've
described in this picture,

77
00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:53.940
the outcome measures that result from high
effort or low effort are quite different.

78
00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.440
So you see that the high effort
distribution is quite a bit higher,

79
00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.850
quite a bit closer to the good outcomes
then is the low effort distribution.

80
00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.720
So that when you get a performance measure
that's pretty high on the good outcomes

81
00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.650
scale, you can be pretty sure
that came from high efforts.

82
00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.110
So you can infer this
employee did something well.

83
00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:13.050
This employee did something right.

84
00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:14.690
You can give them positive feedback.

85
00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.630
Conversely if you see something
in this world that is very

86
00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.450
low on the outcome scale,
close to the bad outcomes end

87
00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.980
then you can be quite confident
that that came from low effort.

88
00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.989
That's because these
signals are quite separate.

89
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.760
So in this environment,

90
00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.020
it's not very hard to tell whether
your employee is working hard or not.

91
00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.490
You get pretty clean signals.

92
00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:36.370
Now it's not perfect.

93
00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.930
If you get an average performance measure,
it can be ambiguous and

94
00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.530
that's gonna be the case often.

95
00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.630
But for a broad range of outcomes,

96
00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:50.000
you can be pretty confident about what
kind of effort the employee gave.

97
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.900
But in other environments, it's brutal to
determine whether the employee gave high

98
00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.310
effort or low effort because of how
overlapping the distributions are.

99
00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:00.510
So for example in this situation,

100
00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:05.310
the good outcome measure more
likely came from high effort, but

101
00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.810
there's still a very reasonable
probability that it came from low effort.

102
00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.920
That maybe someone didn't put in much
work, but the economy broke just right for

103
00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.900
them or their boss covered them or

104
00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.100
the team they worked with happened
to be really on that month.

105
00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.520
All of those things are outside
the employee's control, but

106
00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:25.100
can lead to a low effort performance
resulting in a positive consequence.

107
00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.940
And vice versa,
you might get a bad outcome and

108
00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.100
think on average that came from low effort
but there's still a very reasonable

109
00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:33.910
chance, because of the noise in the
measure that it came from a high effort.

110
00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:37.830
Again, it could be that they
put in 80 hours that week, but

111
00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.450
their teammates let them down or
their boss made a bad decision or

112
00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:42.720
their competitor made an unexpected move.

113
00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.520
So in these environments,
it's very difficult to ascertain

114
00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.689
the level of effort from
a noisy performance measure.

115
00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:56.390
This in essence is the challenge
with performance evaluation.

116
00:05:56.390 --> 00:06:00.540
It's not always quite this difficult,
there's not always this much overlap but

117
00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:04.210
there's always some level of noise and
it makes it difficult to infer,

118
00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:06.670
it makes it difficult to give
the right kind of feedback.

119
00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:11.210
We want to give you some help sorting this
environment because all of you are being

120
00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:15.810
judged in this way to some extent, and all
of you are judging employees in this way.

121
00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:19.070
So this is gonna motivate everything
that comes next essentially.

122
00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:23.500
We're gonna give you some examples,
some techniques and importantly

123
00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:28.310
some biases that people have whenever
they try to make these inferences.

124
00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:32.603
So the merger plan, first is to
give you an extended example and

125
00:06:32.603 --> 00:06:36.338
then drop in to four specific issues and
unpack those.

126
00:06:36.338 --> 00:06:39.957
Because there are biases associated
with each of those issues and

127
00:06:39.957 --> 00:06:43.639
that will lead to some prescriptions
which we provide as we go on and

128
00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:45.570
then we summarize in the last stage
