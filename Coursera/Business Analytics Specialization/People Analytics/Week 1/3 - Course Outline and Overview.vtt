1
00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.430
So let's introduce you
now to the main modules,

2
00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:05.200
the main themes that we're gonna
be covering in this course.

3
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.710
There are four main themes for

4
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.600
the four main sessions that each
of us is gonna be talking about.

5
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.490
In each of these themes
we're also gonna emphasize

6
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.890
particular issues that
criss-cross all of the themes.

7
00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.640
So that you'll see some things being
highlighted in each session that actually

8
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.740
are not specific to that session,
but are cut across.

9
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.620
So let me introduce
them to you one by one.

10
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.950
And then we'll each take a turn to talk
about the particular thing that we

11
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:30.280
discuss in our own sessions.

12
00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.750
So, Cade.

13
00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.620
>> So I'm gonna start in Module 1 by
talking about performance evaluation.

14
00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.000
So this is something everybody has
been on both sides of, probably,

15
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.100
getting your own performance evaluated and
evaluating others.

16
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.020
And the idea here is to bring
data to bear to do a better job.

17
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.070
Given a person and a job, how do we know
whether they're doing well or poorly?

18
00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.440
Whether they're working hard or
slacking off?

19
00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.140
And what mistakes might we make and
avoid by using data.

20
00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.930
>> In the second module I'm
gonna talk about staffing.

21
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.010
So this is how do we get
the right person on the job?

22
00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.380
And so focusing particularly on make sure
we're hiring good people, how we're moving

23
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.020
them inside the organization,
how do we evaluate that as well.

24
00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.500
In doing so, I'm gonna focus a lot
on how people move in organizations.

25
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.690
I'm also gonna spend a bunch of time
talking about kind of another specific

26
00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.610
issue which is key analytics which is
how do we interpret correlations and

27
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.530
how do we think about difference
between correlation and causality.

28
00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.500
And how to make decisions based on that.

29
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.270
>> In the third session, I'm going
to be talking about collaboration.

30
00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.350
And there, what I'm really gonna
introduce you to is the tools and

31
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.120
techniques of organizational
network analysis.

32
00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.610
And to help us analyze collaboration,

33
00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.740
one of the powerful potential insights
that people analytics can offer is that we

34
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.540
can think about collaboration
in terms of networks.

35
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.500
The connections between people that
enable them to get things done.

36
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.140
So we will talk about how can
you map those connections,

37
00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.590
how can you map the networks between
people inside organizations.

38
00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.070
How can you analyze those networks?

39
00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.260
What are the conceptual building
blocks for analyzing them?

40
00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.000
And then how can you really develop some
insights and potentially intervene inside

41
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.219
collaboration networks in order to improve
collaboration inside organizations.

42
00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.640
And one of the themes that I'm gonna
emphasizing in that session that really,

43
00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.980
again, cuts across all of our sessions is
the importance of good measurement and

44
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.570
particularly measuring both
the network side of things but

45
00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.490
measuring your outcomes really well.

46
00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.720
Cuz if you don't measure outcomes
really well then whatever you find,

47
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.170
whatever conclusions you can draw
from your great people analytics,

48
00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.700
statistics and
techniques is gonna mean nothing.

49
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.510
So really how do we measure outcome as
well is a theme that cuts across all of

50
00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:36.310
our sessions.

51
00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.720
>> And then I'm gonna close in Module 4
with a session on talent management, which

52
00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.080
one way of thinking about it is just a
deeper version of performance evaluation.

53
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.840
Where instead of looking at whether
a person's simply working hard or

54
00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.610
slacking off we're looking at their
fundamental talent and evaluating what

55
00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.530
capacity this person has and helping them
develop whatever capacity they do have.

56
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.810
A theme that does cut across all these
modules and is an important issue in

57
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.940
talent management, is also fundamentally
issue in that first module Performance and

58
00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.730
Evaluation, and
that is chance versus true variation.

59
00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.870
True skill differences,
true effort differences.

60
00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.200
People we have a lot of literature
now on mistakes people making in

61
00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.790
reasoning about chance and
it's critical in talent management and

62
00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.930
in performance evaluation
to navigate those issues.

63
00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.950
So we'll give you some ideas there,
some examples there and

64
00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:35.195
if something's gonna come up in any number
of application areas for people on.

65
00:03:35.195 --> 00:03:38.260
>> And then we'll conclude and
just wrap up with

66
00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.250
some discussion of the big challenges
that organizations are facing right now.

67
00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.420
A lot of that we'll discuss as
we go through our sessions, but

68
00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.370
we'll wrap with some closing
thoughts on that and

69
00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.870
some of the exciting future new directions
that we see this field moving in.
