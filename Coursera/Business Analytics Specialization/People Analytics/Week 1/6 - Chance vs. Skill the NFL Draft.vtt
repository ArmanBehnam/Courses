1
00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:06.030
So now we're gonna give you an extended
example of people analytics at work and

2
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:10.950
follow that with some detailed issues
involved in many analytics projects.

3
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.790
So this example comes from my work
with the national football league.

4
00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:19.070
As a result of some research I did a few
years ago, I've been pulled in to work

5
00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.650
with some professional teams on
their evaluation of players.

6
00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.212
And especially their
evaluation of college players.

7
00:00:26.212 --> 00:00:30.710
One team in particular asked me,
who is good at evaluating college players?

8
00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.421
Which team should they be paying attention
to, which team should they be copying?

9
00:00:34.421 --> 00:00:37.016
So, I'll tell you about that analysis, but

10
00:00:37.016 --> 00:00:41.060
first I wanna give you just a little
bit of background on the NFL draft.

11
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.580
So the NFL draft,
this is the National Football League,

12
00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.450
this is American football.

13
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.920
And we will talk some about football,

14
00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.910
but you should think about
this as any hiring exercise.

15
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.270
So this is a law firm hiring
new law school graduates.

16
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.110
This is Google hiring new programmers
to work out in Mountain View.

17
00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.390
This is Credit Suisse looking for
new financial analysts.

18
00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.480
Think of this as recruiting
quite generally.

19
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.560
In the NFL, the draft involves
looking at college players,

20
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.410
here Jamal Charles from
the University of Texas.

21
00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.100
They watch his tape from
when he was on college,

22
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.780
then they bring him into the combine and
they measure them in all kinds of ways,

23
00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.320
how high they can jump,
how fast they can run.

24
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.593
They slot them into orders,
the preferences they have for

25
00:01:23.593 --> 00:01:27.962
these players, so
here's a typical war room from the NFL.

26
00:01:27.962 --> 00:01:29.127
This is Jerry Jones,

27
00:01:29.127 --> 00:01:32.640
who's the owner of the Dallas Cowboys
with the list of players.

28
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.088
And all the teams have these war rooms
with lists of players all year round.

29
00:01:36.088 --> 00:01:37.720
Eventually they make their choices.

30
00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.820
This is on the NFL Draft, this
happens each April, now maybe May, and

31
00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.120
is a major sporting event in and
of itself.

32
00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.280
And then finally, they get to see that
player on the professional field.

33
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.020
So this is Jamaal Charles playing for
the Kansas City Chiefs.

34
00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.090
And the big question is,

35
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.320
to what extent does what they see in
college relate to what they see in pro?

36
00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.220
To what extent can we observe a student
performing in a law school and

37
00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.940
forecast how well they're
gonna be as an actual lawyer?

38
00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.900
That's what's interesting about studying
an NFL, we have better data and

39
00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.540
more observable outcomes
than almost anywhere else.

40
00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:12.700
So we can really dig
into these decisions and

41
00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.230
evaluate how good a job the teams are
doing and identify where the mistakes are.

42
00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.190
So, this is the process the team
comes to me and asks me about.

43
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.230
Who does this well?

44
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.046
Which of the 32 National Football League
teams does this well?

45
00:02:26.046 --> 00:02:29.872
One measure for
how a team is doing in the NFL draft is,

46
00:02:29.872 --> 00:02:33.370
how many of their players
make the all star game.

47
00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.253
In american football that is
called the Pro Bowl and so

48
00:02:36.253 --> 00:02:40.629
we can look at how many players that they
draft that eventually make the Pro Bowl.

49
00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:44.232
And we can compare across the 32 teams
which teams are good at drafting players

50
00:02:44.232 --> 00:02:47.160
that make the Pro Bowl,
which teams are not so good.

51
00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.190
So in this chart,
we look at 11 years of NFL drafts and

52
00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.430
we follow the players' performance for
their entire career,

53
00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.110
however we long we get to
observe them through 2009.

54
00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.930
So we begin with the 1997 draft
through the 2007 draft and

55
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.950
we observe them through 2009.

56
00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.090
And count up the number of
Pro Bowls played by players

57
00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.340
that were drafted by each team.

58
00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.060
So, in a year a team drafts seven or
eight players on average.

59
00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.730
And then on average, a player might play
three or four years, sometimes longer for

60
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.300
very successful players.

61
00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.030
So, we can add these up over time and

62
00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:27.010
get some sense of which teams are having
more or less success in the NFL draft.

63
00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:32.171
If you do that, between 1997 and
2007, this is what you see.

64
00:03:32.171 --> 00:03:36.718
At the top, with the Indianapolis Colts,
you see that they drafted players

65
00:03:36.718 --> 00:03:40.070
that made 35 Pro Bowls over
the time that we observed.

66
00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:44.017
And that ranges all the way down to
the bottom teams, Cleveland and Detroit,

67
00:03:44.017 --> 00:03:47.005
who drafted players that made
only five and six Pro Bowls.

68
00:03:47.005 --> 00:03:50.762
So there are huge differences in
the quality of the players drafted by

69
00:03:50.762 --> 00:03:54.150
Indianapolis, and
those drafted by Cleveland and Detroit.

70
00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.680
With a big spread in between,
all the other teams falling in between.

71
00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.540
So, this analysis, in fact, was first
done by a Journalist, Rick Ryley,

72
00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.390
who at the time,
was with Sports Illustrated.

73
00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.770
And when he saw those numbers,
he said the Indianapolis Colts,

74
00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.100
not just with Peyton Manning,

75
00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.620
but Dwight Freeney, Edgerrin James,
Reggie Wayne these were genius picks.

76
00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.450
On the other hand, the Cleveland Browns
screwed the Chihuahua.

77
00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:19.180
Their run of number one picks
from 99 to 02 is the single

78
00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.290
worst stretch of drafting since
the Iraqi Republican Guard.

79
00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.400
Were they using an Ouija board?

80
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.671
So clearly Riley feels you can draw some
very strong inferences from this data.

81
00:04:29.671 --> 00:04:33.590
And I wanna give Riley credit because
at least he quotes the data, right?

82
00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.480
And one of the things he was
saying in this article was, fans,

83
00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.250
don't worry too much at the time
the players are drafted,

84
00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.520
you don't really know there's so
much uncertainty you have to wait a while.

85
00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.754
And so he waited a while and he crunched
the numbers and now he's certain.

86
00:04:45.754 --> 00:04:48.671
But the trouble is,
there's reason for skepticism.

87
00:04:48.671 --> 00:04:53.541
Reason for Skepticism includes some work
I did a few years ago with Richard Taylor

88
00:04:53.541 --> 00:04:56.550
on how overconfident teams
are in the NFL draft.

89
00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.800
That work led me to appreciate how
much uncertainty there really is and

90
00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.150
it seems unlikely to me that some teams
are so much better than others given that.

91
00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:09.560
Baron and Hershey, our colleague Jack
Hershey here at in my department actually,

92
00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.920
OID here at Warton.

93
00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.340
Studied something that came to be
known as the outcome bias years ago.

94
00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.270
That we tend to judge employees,
individuals,

95
00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.130
organizations by what happens.

96
00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:24.700
Good outcomes lead us to believe that
the employees are good, bad outcomes,

97
00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.160
lead us to believe the employees are bad.

98
00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.100
Regardless of how much control
they had over the process,

99
00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.320
so maybe we're guilty of outcome bias when
we look at the Indianapolis Colts and

100
00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.500
see that Peyton Manning has
been in all these Pro Bowls.

101
00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.340
And then finally, Matthew Rabin,

102
00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:41.190
behavioral economist, did some work
where he used the Law of Small Numbers

103
00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:44.480
to evaluate some decision making
biases that individuals showed.

104
00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:48.350
And he found that there's less
difference in skill than people believe.

105
00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:50.800
He called it fictitious variation.

106
00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.990
And he said fictitious variation's
the most important economic consequence of

107
00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:57.570
the law of small numbers that we
infer too much from small samples.

108
00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:00.970
That's something we're gonna talk about
a little bit more at another place in

109
00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:01.750
the module.

110
00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:05.910
But this academic research gives
us reason to be skeptical.

111
00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:09.770
That these differences are truly the
product of some teams being better than

112
00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.690
other teams at selecting.

113
00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:15.462
So, to dig in this in a little more
detail, we'll drop to the data.

114
00:06:15.462 --> 00:06:19.211
And we're gonna get into more
detail in this part of the course.

115
00:06:19.211 --> 00:06:23.020
In this part of the performance evaluation
module more now than anywhere else.

116
00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:25.070
So, let's actually crunch some numbers.

117
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:30.546
Here, we will look at Performance for
Players Drafted 1991-2004.

118
00:06:30.546 --> 00:06:33.490
So these are players we can observe
perform at least five years and

119
00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:38.220
have a pretty good sense of how they're
gonna be as professional football players.

120
00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:40.360
We can look at how they perform
in a few different ways.

121
00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.050
The patterns are always the same.

122
00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:45.090
The guys taken at the top of the draft
are better than the guys taken at

123
00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:46.280
the bottom of the draft.

124
00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:50.690
So in this graph, we show you the number
of starts that the typical player taken at

125
00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:55.550
the start of the draft plays relative
to the guys taken at the bottom.

126
00:06:55.550 --> 00:07:00.606
About 250 drafts in each year, so, if you
look at the blue line this is the number

127
00:07:00.606 --> 00:07:05.171
of games started by a player drafted,
the first player taken in the draft.

128
00:07:05.171 --> 00:07:09.042
And that drifts down where by
the end of say the fifth round,

129
00:07:09.042 --> 00:07:13.844
160 picks later, those guys
are starting about 20% as many games as

130
00:07:13.844 --> 00:07:16.490
the guys taken at the start of the draft.

131
00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:17.900
So, a big drop in performance.

132
00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:22.090
The drop is even steeper for
the more extreme performance.

133
00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:24.290
So, Pro Bowls,
we were just talking about Pro Bowls.

134
00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:26.410
Does the team,
does the player make an all star game?

135
00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:32.180
The Pro Bowl measure drops from
the guys taken at the top of the draft.

136
00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:35.290
By the time you're down to the second
round, the bottom of the second round,

137
00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:41.090
about the 65th pick, you're below 20%,
it's a very steep performance drop-off.

138
00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:45.818
This suggests that there is skill involved
in drafting players, that the scouts and

139
00:07:45.818 --> 00:07:49.614
the general managers involved
with identifying college players,

140
00:07:49.614 --> 00:07:51.145
know what they're doing,

141
00:07:51.145 --> 00:07:55.025
because the guys taken at the top
are better than the guys down below.

142
00:07:55.025 --> 00:07:58.346
But, does that mean that there
are differences in skill?

143
00:07:58.346 --> 00:08:01.064
Remember that the team that asked me
to look into this wanted to know Which

144
00:08:01.064 --> 00:08:03.204
teams are better at this,
which teams are worse at this,

145
00:08:03.204 --> 00:08:04.743
who should they be paying attention to.

146
00:08:04.743 --> 00:08:07.850
That suggests that some teams
are better than others.

147
00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:10.710
Skill is involved, but
are there differences in skill?

148
00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:14.780
This goes back to our question of
can you separate signal from noise?

149
00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:17.990
Can you really infer whether
the teams are good at this, or

150
00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:19.630
whether they just got lucky?

151
00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:21.710
So, that's where we go next.

152
00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:23.840
And we're gonna do one thing first.

153
00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:28.300
I said in an earlier module,
that you have to be very careful,

154
00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:31.840
in performance evaluation,
comparing employees to one another.

155
00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:35.410
Unless they're in very similar situations,

156
00:08:35.410 --> 00:08:38.290
you will have trouble
comparing them one to another.

157
00:08:38.290 --> 00:08:40.910
So we're gonna make one adjustment
before we start comparing these

158
00:08:40.910 --> 00:08:42.410
teams to each other.

159
00:08:42.410 --> 00:08:46.180
And that is we're gonna control for
where they picked in the draft.

160
00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:50.220
Some teams pick earlier in the draft,
some teams pick later in the draft, and so

161
00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:55.830
we want a norm for
where they actually picked.

162
00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:58.680
So, we're gonna do that by
looking at what would we expect.

163
00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:03.680
This line shows you what you would expect,
for a performance measure, in this case,

164
00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:06.440
the games started per season.

165
00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:10.320
What would you expect for the first player
taken in the draft, based on history?

166
00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:11.960
What would you expect for

167
00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:15.650
the 33rd player taken in the draft,
again based on history?

168
00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:17.090
This line just charts that.

169
00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:21.460
So, on average, over, over a long period
of time, we've observed fourteen,

170
00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:22.530
fifteen years.

171
00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:26.450
The top player in the draft averages
about 11 starts per season.

172
00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:28.430
This is most, 11 starts out of 16,

173
00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:31.110
this is most of the season,
he's starting for five years.

174
00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:33.060
This is a very successful player.

175
00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:37.831
And then drifts down rather
smoothly to say two starts a year.

176
00:09:37.831 --> 00:09:39.952
By the guys taken 160th.

177
00:09:39.952 --> 00:09:41.710
So you get this smooth decline.

178
00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:45.290
This means that when a team
drafts a player 33rd,

179
00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:47.350
you should expect that he's gonna play,

180
00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:51.740
what does it look like, eight and half,
eight and quarter games per season.

181
00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:53.420
So, that's expectation.

182
00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:56.730
We wanna know what our expectation is for
any given decision, so

183
00:09:56.730 --> 00:10:00.450
that we can evaluate it in terms of
deviation from that expectation.

184
00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:03.230
We don't want to reward a team for
picking a good player

185
00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:05.900
just because they were fortunate enough
to have the first pick in the draft.

186
00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:07.270
We don't want to penalize a team for

187
00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:10.360
picking a bad player just because
they had a later pick in the draft.

188
00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:12.510
So it's very important to
contextualize in this way.

189
00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:15.610
We'll talk a lot more
about contextualization

190
00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:16.840
else where in people analytics, but

191
00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:20.410
I want to use it here because if we
are going to compare across teams.

192
00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:23.560
We need to norm their position,
so that's what we do.

193
00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:24.690
This is what it looks like.

194
00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:27.770
This is an example of one team,
the New England Patriots in 2003,

195
00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:29.360
their draft that year.

196
00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:31.680
They had a lot of picks that year.

197
00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:33.620
This looks about ten picks.

198
00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:36.980
And in each case,
we plot where the player was drafted.

199
00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:38.550
As you move from left to right,

200
00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:41.270
the top player was Warren taken
in about pick number ten.

201
00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:45.270
And it goes all the way down to
Kelley taken late in the draft.

202
00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:50.000
And then we plot on the Y-axis how well
that player performed over the first five

203
00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.860
years, which is a period of
time we can be very confident

204
00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:55.630
he was with the team that
actually drafted him.

205
00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:59.150
So the team that drafted him has
generated the benefit of the draft.

206
00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:00.200
And what do we see?

207
00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:03.130
We see in general the guys taken
early in the draft did better,

208
00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:07.030
the guys taken Later in the draft it works
but there's lots of variation, right?

209
00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:08.440
So, consider Koppen.

210
00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:10.630
Koppen was drafted,
he was the sixth player drafted,

211
00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:14.420
he wasn't taken until a hundred and
sixty second, a hundred and sixty third.

212
00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:18.030
but he was the best performer over
the next five years of anybody else in

213
00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:18.590
the draft class.

214
00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:22.590
He started almost every game for
almost the whole five years.

215
00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:26.510
This was a wildly successful
selection late in the draft,

216
00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:31.020
and so you get a very positive
deviation when you evaluate that pick.

217
00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:32.980
Contrast that for example with Johnson.

218
00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:35.750
Johnson was drafted 37, 38, and when

219
00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:41.590
a person's drafted at that level we expect
them start about seven games a year.

220
00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:42.870
He only started two.

221
00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:44.900
So this is way below expectations.

222
00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:47.450
We code that as an unsuccessful pick.

223
00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:54.350
So, now what we want to know is, do teams
tend to have relatively successful picks?

224
00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:56.260
Do they tend to have
relatively unsuccessful?

225
00:11:56.260 --> 00:12:00.020
Or is it just randomly distributed
around what would be expected?

226
00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:04.120
That's where we're going when we're
trying to determine is there skill here?

227
00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:05.560
Or is there luck.

228
00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:10.390
So, here's an example of one of
the most famous draft classes in

229
00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:11.540
national football league history.

230
00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:15.730
The Pittsburg Steelers, famous draft class
of 1974, they drafted four hall of fame

231
00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:19.440
players, Jack Lambert, Lynn Swan,
John Stallworth, Mike Webster.

232
00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:23.690
All these guys were hugely successful,
not just for a year, but for a career.

233
00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:28.420
Now, if the draft,
if the Center Field draft involves skill.

234
00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:29.210
This is a team.

235
00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:32.040
They drafted these players because
they're especially good at their job.

236
00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:35.920
What would you expect to
happen the next year in 1975?

237
00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:40.020
So, assume you've got the same scouts,
you've got the same general manager.

238
00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:42.140
They select all these
great players in '74.

239
00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:47.120
If that's the result of skill,
what would you expect to happen in '75.

240
00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:49.140
Or, what would you expect to happen in 73?

241
00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:50.382
Let's look at 73.

242
00:12:50.382 --> 00:12:54.542
In 73,
their 2nd round pick never played a game.

243
00:12:54.542 --> 00:12:58.460
Their 3rd and
4th round picks were average at best.

244
00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:01.380
And yet, that was just one year before
they had this Hall of Fame class.

245
00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:02.150
What about 75?

246
00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:03.580
What about the next year?

247
00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:04.760
In 75 it was even worse.

248
00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:07.360
Not a single player drafted started.

249
00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:12.250
Out of 21 picks at this enormous draft,
and not a single player drafted started.

250
00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:14.170
And picks in each of the top six rounds.

251
00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:16.960
They only played a total of 24 games for
the team.

252
00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:21.600
So, what do we think about a process

253
00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:25.660
where you draft one of the best classes
ever, probably the best class ever, in 74.

254
00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:29.240
And yet
the 73 draft was completely average.

255
00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:31.820
And the 75 draft was actually
tragically bad by any measure.

256
00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:35.980
What does that say about how
much skill is involved in this?

257
00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:39.060
How much credit should we give them for
that Hall of Fame class in 74?

258
00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:42.470
That's the idea, and
that's a very general idea

259
00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:45.530
that's maybe the biggest lesson
in the performance evaluation is.

260
00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:48.520
The question is, does it persist?

261
00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:50.230
Skill persists.

262
00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:52.140
Chance doesn't persist.

263
00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:55.230
And if the challenge is to
parse skill from chance,

264
00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:58.330
the single most important
test is persistence.

265
00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:00.530
Do you see it across periods?

266
00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:01.690
Do you see it over time?

267
00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:04.140
Do you see the positive
performance measures persist?

268
00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:05.920
That's what we're gonna do here.

269
00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:10.270
This is one look at that for
the NFL draft.

270
00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:13.580
This is the only real analytics
we're gonna do in this example.

271
00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:19.540
We're gonna take all the years
that we observed teams draft and

272
00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:22.020
we're gonna code them up in
just the way we described.

273
00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:26.710
We're going to, evaluate does a player
do better or worse than expectations.

274
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:29.260
And for that year we're going to
add up all of those deviations or

275
00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:32.435
the positive and the negative,
do they add up to zero, whatever.

276
00:14:32.435 --> 00:14:38.160
We're going to evaluate every team and
each year of the draft.

277
00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:39.930
And we're going to rank the league,

278
00:14:39.930 --> 00:14:43.980
one to 32 within a year on how
they performed in a draft.

279
00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:46.490
And then we're gonna ask
what happens to next year.

280
00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:49.210
So for
all the teams that did best in a year,

281
00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:52.420
what happens to them in
the next year's draft?

282
00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:53.980
And we're gonna do for

283
00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:59.080
the teams that rate 16th in a given year,
what happens in the next years draft?

284
00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:01.210
That's gonna give us
a test of persistence.

285
00:15:01.210 --> 00:15:05.760
If this is a skill based task,
those teams that do well

286
00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:08.600
in the draft in a given year
will do well the following year.

287
00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:10.870
Those teams that do poorly will do poorly.

288
00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:14.490
If it's completely chance,
how a team performs in one year

289
00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:17.620
will have nothing to do with
how they perform the next year.

290
00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:19.350
There'll be no correlation
between the two.

291
00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:23.300
And if it's a mix of skill and chance,
you'll see something in between.

292
00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:27.020
That the teams that do well one year
will tend to do better the next year and

293
00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:31.480
the teams that do poorly will tend to do
poorly but they'll regress to the mean.

294
00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:32.380
So that's the test.

295
00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:33.340
We'll find out what happens.

296
00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:34.330
This is what we find.

297
00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:40.840
I've shown all the teams, over all
the years in our study here in gray.

298
00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:44.340
But then I've highlighted the bunch
that were rated in number one,

299
00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:46.300
from the top in green.

300
00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:48.960
And then in the middle in blue,
and the bottom in red.

301
00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:50.260
And what do we see?

302
00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:54.450
What do we see here about the relation
between how a team does in one year and

303
00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:55.679
the following year?

304
00:15:55.679 --> 00:16:00.474
At a high level,
we see essentially no relation.

305
00:16:00.474 --> 00:16:02.325
Consider, for example,
the teams at the very top in green.

306
00:16:02.325 --> 00:16:05.290
These are teams that, in a given season,

307
00:16:05.290 --> 00:16:09.940
were the single top performing
team in drafting players.

308
00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:11.410
What happens to them the next year?

309
00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:15.027
Well, one team was again
the top-performing team.

310
00:16:15.027 --> 00:16:17.550
But, one team was also
the worst-performing team.

311
00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:21.090
And you can see that there's a full
spread, that from that number one

312
00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:25.490
position, they went to every other
position from one to thirty-two,

313
00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:27.880
there was no predictive quality.

314
00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:30.830
About their first year
performance in the next year.

315
00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:32.290
And conversely, the same at the bottom.

316
00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:36.870
You can look at the teams in red,
which is 28th or so, and

317
00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:41.290
in one case, 28th was again 28th,
almost perfect persistence.

318
00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:44.810
But, in the other cases, they drifted up,
some were kinda middling the next year,

319
00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:47.310
and some were actually quite
good in the following year.

320
00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:51.270
So, this tells us overall
the correlation is slightly negative.

321
00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:53.080
Not different from zero but
slightly negative.

322
00:16:54.130 --> 00:16:57.360
Essentially, zero, there's no correlation

323
00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:01.980
between how a team drafts at one year and
how they draft the next year.

324
00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:05.010
And when there's no correlation,
we can be sure,

325
00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:08.400
that means the differences that we
observe are not the product of skill,

326
00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:11.250
the differences we observe
are the product of chance.

327
00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:14.520
So, this is one performance measure,
it's a starts, you can do this for

328
00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:19.790
other performance measures, this is how
much a player receives in compensation,

329
00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:24.000
when he reaches free agency, you can use
any number of performance measure and

330
00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.340
you get the same result.

331
00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:28.910
Most of the deviation
goes away the next year

332
00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:30.730
which means that most of the deviations,

333
00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:35.300
most of the differences between teams
are the result of chance and not skill.

334
00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:39.420
So, different performance stats,
different player career stage.

335
00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:42.790
You can norm for
additional factors like a player position.

336
00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:45.890
You can evaluate not the team
level performance, but

337
00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:50.210
you actually look at the person in charge,
whether it's a general manager or

338
00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:55.450
an owner, and you can track that
individual's performance over his career,

339
00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:57.360
and again you don't see persistence.

340
00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:02.730
The vast majority of the variation
is purely a product of chance.

341
00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:07.410
So, you might say, fine, fine, fine, this
fancy regression to the mean analysis,

342
00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:09.330
persistent analysis, but
what about this chart?

343
00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:12.530
Because it's hard to make
sense of this chart, right?

344
00:18:12.530 --> 00:18:13.720
That's a lot of variation.

345
00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:17.000
Can you really get that
much variation from chance?

346
00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:19.790
So, quick demonstration.

347
00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:25.960
In this case, we charted every
player by what team drafted him.

348
00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:26.960
Let's do something else.

349
00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:33.180
Instead, let's look at every player by
what day of the month he was born on.

350
00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:38.020
And we can ask are there differences in
the likelihood of making the Pro Bowl

351
00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:42.100
as the result of being born on the 3rd
of the month, or the 28th of the month,

352
00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:43.410
or the 10th of the month.

353
00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:47.120
We do that because we know that's random.

354
00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:50.880
We know that can't possibly be
related to player performance.

355
00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:53.740
And we're curious if you do that,
what pattern do you see.

356
00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:57.440
Well, you see a very similar pattern

357
00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:00.950
to what happens when you bend
by which team chose them.

358
00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:03.400
So, if we get the exact same pattern,
and in fact,

359
00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:09.450
it's the exact same pattern, when we bend
by day of the month they were born on,

360
00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:13.480
as when we bend by the team
that drafted them,

361
00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:18.260
it ought to give us caution in drawing
any inferences about those teams.

362
00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:21.860
Because it shows that even these
dramatically disparate outcomes

363
00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:24.390
can be purely the product of chance.

364
00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:26.420
And this is something we need
to be reminded of again and

365
00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:29.480
again, we'll drop into some of
those details subsequently, but

366
00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:33.200
we need to be reminded again and
again that big variations in performance

367
00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:35.730
measures can be purely
the product of chance.

368
00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:39.020
And so, we want to be very careful
about drawing strong inferences

369
00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:42.450
about the skill or the effort that
underlie the performance measure.

370
00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:45.560
One last note before we go.

371
00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:48.820
You might ask well maybe people already
know this, people that follow football,

372
00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:50.570
maybe you don't follow football so
you don't know.

373
00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:52.000
Do people think this?

374
00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.060
Have a quick study with
Berkeley Dietvorst, a PhD student here on

375
00:19:56.060 --> 00:20:00.860
what people believe to be the driver
of NFL draft performance.

376
00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:05.560
We asked people how much draft outcome
is completely due to random chance

377
00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:08.630
versus draft outcomes are completely
due to drafting skill?

378
00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:14.240
Where on that continuum, skill to chance,
do you believe draft outcomes fall?

379
00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:17.280
And we asked this of NFL fans and
we screened them, for actually following

380
00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:21.870
the NFL and what do you see, you see
people, they don't think it's all skill.

381
00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:25.090
But the vast majority of people believe
that it is on the skill side of

382
00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:25.880
the continuum.

383
00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:29.250
Almost nobody says that
it's chance-related.

384
00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:32.620
By far the most are two-thirds,
three-quarters, skill.

385
00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:35.850
And these are folks that actually
follow NFL, follow the draft.

386
00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:38.070
They know that there's
a little chance involved, but

387
00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:40.840
they greatly underestimate the amount
of chance that's involved.

388
00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:46.580
I wanna close this example, this extended
example with a quote from Michael Lewis.

389
00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:49.480
The author Michael Lewis started
his career with Lias Parker,

390
00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:53.870
about Salmon brothers wrote
more recently on WallStreet,

391
00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:58.290
probably best known for his book,
Moneyball, on analytics and baseball and

392
00:20:58.290 --> 00:21:03.000
he said when talking after that book
was published that people ask him

393
00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:08.280
Lewis you've studied more serious topics,
why are you studying baseball now?

394
00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:11.620
And he said the following,
which I think is very instructive.

395
00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:15.120
He said if professional baseball players,
whose achievements are endlessly watched,

396
00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:19.580
discussed and analyzed by tens of millions
of people, can be radically mis-valued,

397
00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:20.810
who can't be?

398
00:21:20.810 --> 00:21:24.490
If such a putatively meritocratic culture
as professional baseball can be so

399
00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:27.140
sloppy and inefficient, what can't be?

400
00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:32.580
So this, again, should give us great
pause if in this world of football with

401
00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:37.630
very good performance measures on the way
in, great outcome measures on the way out,

402
00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:41.260
millions of dollars at stake, millions of
people watching these decisions and yet

403
00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:46.290
we still see these kinds of mistakes made
and not appreciated, we still see people

404
00:21:46.290 --> 00:21:53.540
misunderstanding skill versus chance in
this very important task in that culture.

405
00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:57.790
What does that say about what's going on
in firms that we don't have as much, or

406
00:21:57.790 --> 00:21:59.400
we don't have as many people watching.

407
00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:01.310
We don't have as good an outcome measure.

408
00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:05.960
It should give us pause at the quality
of the inferences that are being drawn

409
00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:07.560
in the organizations that you and
I work in.
