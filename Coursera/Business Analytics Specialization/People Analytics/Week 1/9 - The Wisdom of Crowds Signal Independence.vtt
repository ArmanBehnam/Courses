00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:05.860
A third issue that we want to emphasize
in performance evaluation is signal

2
00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:07.070
independence.

3
00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:11.460
And to do this, I want to begin with
this notion of the wisdom of crowds,

4
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.780
which has become very
popular in recent years.

5
00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.320
It comes from a book, the name comes
from a book, by James Surowiecki.

6
00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.600
He draws on research that's been going on.

7
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:25.660
For probably a 100 years but
the fact that Surowiecki wrote this book

8
00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.790
lead many academics to do more
research in this area, and

9
00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.480
it's become a very hot area in research.

10
00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.430
The basic observation is that the average
of a large number of forecasts

11
00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.730
reliably outperforms the average
individual forecast.

12
00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.030
So the motivating example
are these historical county fairs.

13
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.700
Where you might have a large cow,
for example, in a pen.

14
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.740
And everyone who comes to the fair
gets to guess the weight of the cow.

15
00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.620
And the interesting bit,
the fascinating bit really,

16
00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.540
is that even though most people
are quite wrong in their guesses,

17
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.470
the average of their guesses
is remarkably accurate.

18
00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.830
And this has been shown in county fairs,
but also in many other domains that

19
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.570
the result of all these bets is that
the idiosyncratic areas offset each other.

20
00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.530
I might be a little bit high,
you might guess a little bit low.

21
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.730
If there's enough of you and

22
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:22.360
me making these guesses, then we
tend to get very close to the truth.

23
00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.140
So this has been studied in many domains
now and shown in many places and

24
00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.300
it provides a way to get closer to
the truth by getting more signals,

25
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.760
getting more people involved,
getting more judgements from more people.

26
00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.430
This is something that some firms
do in performance evaluation and

27
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.740
more firms should do more of.

28
00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.980
But there's one very important caveat,
and that is that the value of the crowd

29
00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.500
critically depends on
the independence of their opinions.

30
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.450
So if, for example,

31
00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.810
in the county fair if everyone who walked
up to the booth talked with each other

32
00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.020
before they made their guess, the value
of the crowd would greatly diminish.

33
00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.710
They wouldn't be,

34
00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.080
those idiosyncratic errors would be
a little bit less idiosyncratic.

35
00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.630
Now they'd be related to each other.

36
00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.620
If one person was loudly arguing that he
knew because of the breed of cow this was,

37
00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:11.780
or the last cow he saw,
that this was a particular weight,

38
00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.490
he would influence everybody's opinion.

39
00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.400
Their opinions wouldn't be independent.

40
00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.920
And the value of those independent
signals, would be washed away.

41
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.270
So, it's not merely a crowd that you need.

42
00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:27.480
You need a crowd that is to the extent
possible independent of one another.

43
00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.370
So, independent here means uncorrelated.

44
00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.540
If the opinions are actually correlated,

45
00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.920
then the value of each additional
opinions quickly diminishes.

46
00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.990
So if you think you have the opinion of
100 people, if they're actually highly

47
00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.080
correlated, then you might only
have the opinion of 5 or 10.

48
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.300
It's striking how quickly you rob

49
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.740
a crowd of it's value when
those opinions are correlated.

50
00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:50.620
Here's a chart of that.

51
00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:56.220
This comes from Bob Clemen and Bob Winkler
down at Duke, 1985 study where they just

52
00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.910
kind of worked out mathematically, what's
the equivalent number of experts for

53
00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.970
a given number of experts and the degree
to which those experts are correlated?

54
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.680
So here's what they found.

55
00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:15.140
If the correlation is 0, in other words,
if the experts are perfectly independent,

56
00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.620
then every expert you add
creates that much new value.

57
00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.990
So the equivalent number
independent expert is the same.

58
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:27.740
But when those expert opinions becomes
correlated even at 0.2 which is a pretty

59
00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:33.920
low correlation even at 0.2, you quickly
lose the value of adding experts.

60
00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:39.466
So for example, in this chart, it shows
that as you go from 0 experts to 9,

61
00:03:39.466 --> 00:03:44.337
if you have a correlation of 0.2,
you never quite get above 4.

62
00:03:44.337 --> 00:03:47.126
You asymptote there,
where you have nine judges, but because

63
00:03:47.126 --> 00:03:50.547
there's a little correlation between
them the effective number of judges,

64
00:03:50.547 --> 00:03:52.850
there's only three, three and a half.

65
00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.920
If the correlation's 0.4,
it plateaus much more around 2.

66
00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.820
If the correlation is point A, you're
not getting much more than one opinion,

67
00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.400
even though you've gotten nine experts.

68
00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.420
This should be very sobering to us.

69
00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.840
So we wanna push you towards crowds.

70
00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.520
We wanna push you towards more opinions,
more assessments, cuz that's gonna help.

71
00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.520
But you've got to simultaneously
try to maintain the independence

72
00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:18.190
of those opinions.

73
00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.190
In a recent study by Floyd and
Zimmerman, and

74
00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.420
colleagues from Zurich, they found that
even when you tell people the correlation,

75
00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.350
even when you tell them the exact
structure of where the correlation is,

76
00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.350
how strong the correlation is,
people don't properly adjust.

77
00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:35.330
It is sobering to think about how
people deal with according to opinion,

78
00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.760
it's actually not laid out for
them explicitly.

79
00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.600
This is not something people
deal with very naturally.

80
00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.990
Where does the correlation come from?

81
00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.700
How can we think about signal
independence in terms that

82
00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.020
we are familiar with in organizations.

83
00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.210
Well, the most obvious is that,

84
00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.640
it happens when people have
discussed the issue together.

85
00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.270
When they've had conversations,

86
00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.430
when they've bounced their
opinions off of each other.

87
00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.170
As soon as that's happened,
they no longer have independent opinions.

88
00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:03.260
It can happen if they simply
talk to the same people,

89
00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.460
maybe they don't talk to each other, but
they both talk to the same third party.

90
00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.040
Or they share the same friends, or

91
00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.380
they went to dinner with the same
group on different nights before.

92
00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.720
All of these things
break down independence,

93
00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.770
all of these things increase correlation.

94
00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.770
It even happens when people
have the same background.

95
00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:20.300
If they're from the same place.

96
00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.290
If they've trained the same way.

97
00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:24.040
If they have the same advisors.

98
00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.200
If they have the same
historical experiences.

99
00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:30.190
All of these things tend to increase
the correlation in their opinions.

100
00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:33.850
Therefore, all of these things
break down the independence, and

101
00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:39.580
decrease the value of adding additional
voices to whatever process you're running.

102
00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:42.770
So we push towards a broader sample.

103
00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:45.160
We push towards more sources,

104
00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.450
more assessments, but
with a very important caveat.

105
00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:51.670
You need to bill those as
independently as possible and

106
00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:55.590
then design processes to keep
them as independent as possible.
