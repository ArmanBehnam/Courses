00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.910
So a quick summary of
the performance evaluation section.

2
00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:05.740
I just wanna emphasize two main points.

3
00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.270
Number one, understand you environment.

4
00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:10.970
One way to think about this is
the distinction between the two

5
00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:14.180
sets of curves we showed
you early in this module.

6
00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.142
How noisy is the environment relative
to the signal that you observe in

7
00:00:18.142 --> 00:00:19.899
the performance evaluation.

8
00:00:19.899 --> 00:00:23.840
We gave you two examples, one of which
quite a bit of difference between high

9
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.166
effort and low effort, so it's relatively
easy to draw the signal from the noise.

10
00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:32.539
And conversely there's, it could be that
there's not much difference between high

11
00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:36.502
effort and low effort, so it's much
harder to find the signal and the noise.

12
00:00:36.502 --> 00:00:41.266
And a qualitative way to think about this
is you might characterize an environment

13
00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:45.696
as being relatively chance based,
more like a lottery or more skill based?

14
00:00:45.696 --> 00:00:47.031
More like a math problem.

15
00:00:47.031 --> 00:00:48.273
And then ask yourself how?

16
00:00:48.273 --> 00:00:49.980
Most are mixed by the way.

17
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.330
So you should be asking yourself
how much is my environment, or

18
00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.380
how much is the environment of
the employees I'm evaluating

19
00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.309
like a math problem and
how much of it is like a lottery?

20
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.890
A trick here though is that you need
to also understand that you're biased.

21
00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.140
We had these biases in
making these assessments.

22
00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.940
So, we touched on them briefly but we
tend to make non-regressive predictions.

23
00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.110
We don't understand
regression to the mean and so

24
00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.410
we forecast too directly from things
that have happened in the past.

25
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.110
We tend to believe.

26
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.170
The outcomes reflect the underlying
quality or efforts with this Outcome bias.

27
00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.700
We tend to believe that we knew something
was gonna happen before it happened,

28
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.150
even though we didn't,
this is Hindsight bias.

29
00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.820
And we tend to tell narratives that make
sense of all the events that we observe.

30
00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:40.190
All of these things get in the way of our
appreciating the role that chance plays.

31
00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.005
And that means that they will buy us
our understanding of the environment.

32
00:01:44.005 --> 00:01:48.250
It will lead us to believe that our
environments are more like a math problem

33
00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:49.475
than they actually are.

34
00:01:49.475 --> 00:01:52.660
It will lead us to underestimate
the extent to which our environments

35
00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.440
are a little bit like a lottery.

36
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.820
All of those are problems for the way
that we infer the effort level of our

37
00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.540
employees, the quality of our employees,
from our performance measures.

38
00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.460
The key of course,
the trick is to account for chance, and

39
00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.430
the key there is persistence.

40
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:12.880
You need to find the most fundamental
performance measure possible.

41
00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.750
That means the most skill-related.

42
00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:15.920
And the most skill related,

43
00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.110
the most fundamental will be
the most persistent overtime.

44
00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.670
So we gave you an extent of example
of how we did the NFL draft.

45
00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.202
But the key tactic is to
take these split samples and

46
00:02:26.202 --> 00:02:31.478
ask are the differences we observe in
one period there in the second period?

47
00:02:31.478 --> 00:02:36.118
That's the key test for persistence,
that's the key test for true skill,

48
00:02:36.118 --> 00:02:38.235
true signal as opposed to chance.

49
00:02:38.235 --> 00:02:40.370
And finally, some critical questions.

50
00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.420
You can think of this as a battery you
can take to any performance evaluation

51
00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.280
meeting, to any budget meeting,
resource allocation meeting.

52
00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.880
Anything that turns on
judgements about an employee or

53
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.920
technology, some kind of performance
evaluation, take these questions.

54
00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.820
Are the differences persistent or random?

55
00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.410
How do we know that this
isn't just good or bad luck?

56
00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.830
Is the sample large enough
to draw strong conclusions?

57
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.180
How can we make the sample larger?

58
00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.480
How many different signals
are we really tapping into here?

59
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.480
How can we make them as
independent as possible?

60
00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.790
And then finally,
what else do we care about?

61
00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.250
Are we measuring enough?

62
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.980
What can we measure that's
actually more fundamental than

63
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.900
what we're measuring right now?

64
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.610
The keys persistence, large samples,
independent assessments, and

65
00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.250
more fundamental measures,
more process measures.

66
00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.830
You can take these critical
questions to any evaluation and

67
00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:35.330
improve the decision making process.
