1
00:00:01.208 --> 00:00:05.160
So the second issue I want to
talk about is sample size and

2
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.760
want to begin with the psychology
of sample size, essentially.

3
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.210
And this motivates our use of
data to increase samples and

4
00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:18.200
provide some caution on our use
of small intuitive samples.

5
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:23.060
The first is the example,
this is from a classic research study

6
00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.010
where participants were asked
the following vignette.

7
00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:28.920
Your firm has two plants, one large and

8
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.740
one small, which mass produce
a standard computer chip.

9
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:32.900
Other than the amount they produce,

10
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.990
the two plants are identical
in all essential regards.

11
00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.330
Both use the same technology
to produce the same product.

12
00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:43.190
When properly functioning this
technology produces 1% defective items.

13
00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.820
Whenever the number of defective items
from one day's production exceeds 2%,

14
00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.310
a special note is made in the quality
control log to flag the problem.

15
00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:52.370
At the end of the quarter,

16
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:58.130
which plant would you expect to have more
flagged days in the quality control log?

17
00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.020
So, two identical plants, big and

18
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:05.840
small, how many fall outside
the quality control acceptable limits?

19
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.540
Everything else about
the plant is the same,

20
00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.800
it's just that one is
larger than the other.

21
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.960
Does the small plant have
more of these deviations,

22
00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.220
does the large plant have more,
or are they the same?

23
00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.940
Because, after all,
they're identical in every other respect.

24
00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.545
So, if you ask people this about
22% say the smaller plant,

25
00:01:23.545 --> 00:01:27.580
30% the larger plant, and
then about half say the same.

26
00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.085
Because in fact,
all the technologies are the same,

27
00:01:30.085 --> 00:01:31.030
why should have be any different.

28
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.020
What's the right answer?

29
00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.750
The right answer is the small plant of
course, because from small samples,

30
00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.730
you get greater variation and what
we're talking about here is variation.

31
00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:48.370
These are production outcomes that fall
outside the quality control limits.

32
00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.120
Those are variations from expectation.

33
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.060
Small samples necessarily are more
varied and people don't appreciate that.

34
00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.910
And this is a major problem for
performance evaluation

35
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:05.040
because we are apt to draw a too strong
a conclusion from small samples.

36
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.270
Let's look at this in
a little more detail.

37
00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.236
Sample means converge to population
means as the sample size increases.

38
00:02:12.236 --> 00:02:15.026
If you've had a statistics course you
might recognize this as the central

39
00:02:15.026 --> 00:02:15.661
limit theorem.

40
00:02:15.661 --> 00:02:18.865
So because this happens
as we get larger and

41
00:02:18.865 --> 00:02:24.383
larger samples the converse is exactly
true that the smaller the sample,

42
00:02:24.383 --> 00:02:28.070
the more likely you see
more extreme values.

43
00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.565
So there is a couple example questions.

44
00:02:30.565 --> 00:02:33.490
What are you more likely to see,
a .400 batting average in baseball,

45
00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.330
which is a very good batting average,
far higher than we typically see.

46
00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.140
Do you see it at the beginning
of the season around May 1st or

47
00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.800
towards the end of the season,
September 1st?

48
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.670
Well of course, you're far more likely
to see such an extreme batting average

49
00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:47.800
from a small sample.

50
00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.390
The kind of sample you could have
at the beginning of the season than

51
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:51.430
you would later.

52
00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.120
What about hospitals?

53
00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.570
Where are you likely to see dramatically
higher percentage of boys than girls, or

54
00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.560
vice versa, born on any given day?

55
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.980
A small community hospital,
which might have 4-5 births a day?

56
00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.220
Or a large city hospital which
might have 100 births a day.

57
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:12.310
Where are you more likely to see the
population mean vary in that daily sample?

58
00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.970
The small hospital, of course,
could see large variations.

59
00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.980
You might have all girls one day,
all boys another day in a small hospital.

60
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.390
There's no way you have
that in a larger hospital.

61
00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.670
We emphasize this because it should
give us great caution in what we

62
00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:35.400
say from small samples, but importantly
it shows that we don't have that caution.

63
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.290
We tend to believe that what we see
in a small sample is representative

64
00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.030
of the underlying population.

65
00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.070
We don't appreciate that a small
sample can bounce around quite a bit.

66
00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:50.120
And not in fact be representative
of the underlying population.

67
00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.100
This means that we should be very
careful to not follow our intuition

68
00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.160
on what it means when we
only have a small sample.

69
00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.270
This is a bias acknowledged
in the literature called,

70
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:03.192
the law of small numbers,
which is silly of course,

71
00:04:03.192 --> 00:04:06.660
there is no law of small numbers,
it's not like a law of the large numbers.

72
00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.890
The small numbers in fact, what makes
them interesting is that there is no law,

73
00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:10.900
they bounce around.

74
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.880
People believe small samples
closely share the properties

75
00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.590
of the underlying population,
but in fact they don't.

76
00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.080
This means they too readily
infer population's properties,

77
00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.240
the average from the samples.

78
00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:25.720
They neglect the role variability plays,
chance plays, in these small samples.

79
00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.250
What are the implications?
What are the implications in

80
00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:28.126
your organization?

81
00:04:28.126 --> 00:04:33.488
This is a fundamental issue in
performance evaluation, because often,

82
00:04:33.488 --> 00:04:38.800
maybe even typically, performance
evaluation is on small samples.

83
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.160
The smaller the sample,

84
00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.470
the more we have to be cautious what
kind of inference we draw from it.

85
00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.800
So this is a place where data
can make a big difference,

86
00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.390
this is a place where
by using more sources,

87
00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:56.620
more history, using data as opposed to

88
00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.430
just relying on our intuition we had
the chance to collect larger samples.

89
00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.680
But I don't want to say
data alone is sufficient,

90
00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.830
in fact it's interesting
to note that in academia,

91
00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.850
especially in psychology but now it's
expanding to other disciplines as well.

92
00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:16.440
We are discovering that we have been
drawing too strong an inference from even

93
00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.950
our academic research.

94
00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:21.190
There's somewhat of a revolution
going on in psychology,

95
00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:26.270
now being picked up in other disciplines,
that the main theme of which is,

96
00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.040
we've been drawing too strong an inference
from the samples we've been using,

97
00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:34.990
so this isn't just academia saying be
careful out there, you non-academics.

98
00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:39.390
It's even academics that have had to
learn that we too readily draw inferences

99
00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:41.530
from samples that aren't
really sufficient.

100
00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:45.530
The lesson is almost always get more data,
get bigger samples,

101
00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:48.660
be careful about the inferences you
draw from these small numbers, and

102
00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:53.030
know that we have a bias towards jumping
too quickly based on the small samples.
