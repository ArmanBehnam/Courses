00:00:04.001 --> 00:00:07.210
Hello and
welcome to our People Analytics course.

2
00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:10.500
This is Cade Massey, Professor of
the practice here at the Wharton School

3
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.750
in the Operations Information and
Decisions Department.

4
00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.350
I'm joined by
>> Matthew Bidwell, I'm

5
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.700
an Associate Professor in the Management
Department also at the Wharton School.

6
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:21.780
>> I'm Martine Haas.

7
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.090
I'm also an associate professor of
management in the Wharton School.

8
00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.180
>> A lot of corporations say that
people are their most important asset.

9
00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.850
In a sense, people analytics is
about taking that idea seriously and

10
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.270
behaving as if that were true.

11
00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.970
So if you think about what's happened in
a lot of other fields over the last 10,

12
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.840
20 years, it's being the increasing use
of data and analytics to make decisions.

13
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.300
So if you think about finance,
it's really being revolutionized by these

14
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.190
quantitative models which
they use to price assets,

15
00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.240
understand markets, occasionally
to blow up the financial markets.

16
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.730
But when they're not doing that,
really to try and

17
00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.490
understand what's the way
we can make profits?

18
00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.780
If you think about marketing,
increasingly, and

19
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.450
we have a marketing analytics course,
which is really focusing on

20
00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:08.460
how people are now using more and more
data to understand their customers better.

21
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.260
To segment, to focus on how can we
create products that they want, and

22
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.430
how can we then really target
our marketing towards them?

23
00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.240
The idea is to apply the same
ideas to people, okay?

24
00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.230
In an organization when we manage people,
we have to make a lot of

25
00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:25.850
different decisions,
those decisions should be informed.

26
00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.160
So people analytics is really
just the use of data and

27
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.030
analytic tools to make better
decisions about how we manage people.

28
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.100
So a lot of the energy around people
analytics are stemmed from two places.

29
00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.080
One is obviously this interest in
if we can manage our people better,

30
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.640
it's obviously gonna
benefit the organization.

31
00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.330
The second place it comes from is
the sense that we now have more and

32
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.760
more data about what people are doing
that we could actually put at the service

33
00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.420
of these decisions.

34
00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.790
Also for a while now organizations
have been gathering data

35
00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.780
on the basics of their personnel.

36
00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.560
Their performance ratings every year, how
they're being paid, what their jobs are,

37
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.590
to give us a better sense of what's
going on in the organization.

38
00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.880
Maybe be able to identify our
high performers and so on.

39
00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.020
Increasingly that's being
supplemented by other data.

40
00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.950
So we now see applicant tracking systems
where we put in the details of everybody

41
00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.820
who applies to the job, so we can start
to understand how we're screening them.

42
00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.890
We have to addition to
that now workflow data.

43
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.143
If you work in a call center, you're
going to have your calls monitored, so

44
00:02:27.143 --> 00:02:29.700
we know how many calls
you make every hour.

45
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:30.430
What's the rate?

46
00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.900
How many people hang up on you?

47
00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.470
We have increasing data on
customer satisfaction, as well,

48
00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.310
through the surveys you fill
out at the end of those calls.

49
00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.940
So you know more and
more about how people are performing.

50
00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.600
You can start to think
about what's driving them.

51
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.400
You see some of the same with
software engineers, where more and

52
00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.486
more of their work is being monitored as
they check various pieces of code into

53
00:02:49.486 --> 00:02:50.830
repositories and so on.

54
00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.210
We can start to analyze that.

55
00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:56.330
There are new dimensions
of this with communication.

56
00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.060
More and more of our communication is
happening in technology mediated ways.

57
00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.900
Through email, through telephone,
through bulletin boards and so on.

58
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.980
So, we can see who's talking to who.

59
00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.170
Start to understand where
does collaboration happen?

60
00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.940
Who are the hubs within the organization?

61
00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.620
And even now we know where people
are increasingly with wearables and

62
00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.570
other devices tracking people's location.

63
00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:23.580
And so we know more and more about what
people are doing in the organization.

64
00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.390
And the idea is we can start to
bring some of that data to bear

65
00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.010
on understanding how could
we manage that better.

66
00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.380
So we've seen this in a wide variety
of different kinds of decisions.

67
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.270
So from the basics of actually figuring
out what good performance means, and

68
00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:41.660
who's exhibiting it to making
decisions about how to manage them.

69
00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.310
Who should we be hiring?

70
00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:44.740
Who should we promote?

71
00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:48.310
What are kind of the career paths that
make sense within the organization?

72
00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.800
What do the collaboration
patterns look like here?

73
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.080
Who are our critical communicators?

74
00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.130
What can we do to get
communication improved?

75
00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:01.070
On top of that, increasing so I wanna put
data behind some of our decisions about

76
00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:03.400
how to manage overall programs.

77
00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:08.206
So there are often issues
around is our training working?

78
00:04:08.206 --> 00:04:10.600
What's our return on
investment on the training?

79
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.270
Our new fast-track promotion scheme,
is that a good idea or a bad idea?

80
00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:17.010
If we change incentives, what happens?

81
00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.130
Traditionally we've had to go by hunch and
feel for making these decisions.

82
00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.130
Increasingly, though,
we can put data behind them.

83
00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.420
That's really the promise here.

84
00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:30.220
People analytics is a field that's really
been emerging over the last few years and

85
00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.560
where there's tremendous
energy at the moment.

86
00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.180
Part of what we want to do during this
course is transmit a little bit of that

87
00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.060
excitement to you.

88
00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.518
So we thought we'd just start by
saying why do we get excited about it?

89
00:04:40.518 --> 00:04:42.980
At least Martine and
I both have English backgrounds, so

90
00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:45.410
getting exciting is obviously
challenging for either of us.

91
00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.710
But Cade is American, so I think he'll
be able to tell us slightly better.

92
00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.870
Cade, what is it about people
analytics that excites you?

93
00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.230
>> Well, where I come from academically
is the decision making world,

94
00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:58.130
which mostly studies
the mistakes people make,

95
00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.810
the biases they have in their judgment and
in their decisions.

96
00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.120
And in recent years,

97
00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.520
we've gotten a little more interested
in helping people fix that.

98
00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.630
Not just documenting the mistakes, but
actually improving their decision-making.

99
00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.950
And data provides this great opportunity.

100
00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:13.080
It's not a panacea.

101
00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.640
There's no guarantee because you
have data you make better decisions.

102
00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.630
But it is an opportunity
to improve decision-making.

103
00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.870
And so it's this great new avenue for
the decision-making world, and

104
00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:27.280
then the people side of things is
just what I care the most about.

105
00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:32.840
So we have colleagues that study
different elements of the business world.

106
00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.425
And you kind of choose what
you are most passionate about,

107
00:05:35.425 --> 00:05:38.000
what I really care about is individuals.

108
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.743
This is one of the main ways they are
affected, how organizations treat them,

109
00:05:41.743 --> 00:05:44.290
who hires them, who promotes them.

110
00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:49.420
And it's one of the main ways that
organizations then prosper or

111
00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:52.860
don't, because individuals and
people are so important.

112
00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.280
So it's this intersection
of better decision-making,

113
00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.350
which is my academic background, and

114
00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:00.980
people's lives and what people provide
to organizations that I care most about.

115
00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:02.646
>> Martine?

116
00:06:02.646 --> 00:06:07.980
>> So my research is in the area
of organizational behavior.

117
00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:11.940
And my main interest, what I'm really,
spend a lot of time thinking about and

118
00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:15.890
studying and trying to figure out is how
organizations can learn better from what

119
00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:18.830
they do in one part of the world,
how they can transmit that learning so

120
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:22.350
that they can do better in their
operations in another part of the world.

121
00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:24.060
And of course it's people
who are doing that, right?

122
00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:27.200
So it's people who are learning from each
other, who are collecting information and

123
00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.800
experiencing and developing expertise
in one part of the organization,

124
00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:31.880
one part of the world.

125
00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.410
How do they, how do other people,

126
00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:36.470
especially in large distributed
organizations, learn from that?

127
00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:40.060
And so this is a very distinctive
area in terms of people analytics.

128
00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:43.710
It's kind of how do people work together
better in order to get their work done?

129
00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:46.410
So it's not so much the selection and
hiring components,

130
00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:48.480
which you guys think about a lot.

131
00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:51.300
But really my focus is mostly
on these collaboration elements.

132
00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.400
How can people work together
more effectively and

133
00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.080
perform better as a result?

134
00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:59.250
And so, again, people analytics
provides a really wealth of

135
00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:02.050
possible data to look at
people collaborating because

136
00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:04.110
previously we've just had to sort
of observe what people are doing.

137
00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:05.680
Are they talking to each other?

138
00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.241
Are they making phone calls?

139
00:07:07.241 --> 00:07:11.433
We've had some data, we can ask people
in surveys some of this information.

140
00:07:11.433 --> 00:07:15.665
But especially in large organizations,
where there's a lot of stuff going on,

141
00:07:15.665 --> 00:07:19.898
now we have increasing sources of data to
enable us to really track how much people

142
00:07:19.898 --> 00:07:23.011
are using databases to store
what they know, that somebody

143
00:07:23.011 --> 00:07:27.310
else can access from somewhere very
far away, and maybe many months later.

144
00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:29.230
We have all sorts of interaction forms,

145
00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:35.060
communication through question and
answer online formats.

146
00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:37.970
And obviously through conferences and
all sorts of other ways.

147
00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:40.840
That we now are collecting data on to
see where these things are effective and

148
00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:42.530
are helping people to
do their work better.

149
00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:45.400
Or maybe they're just a time sink and
you're spending way too much time

150
00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.680
trying to kind of access
these sources of information.

151
00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:50.850
So trying to figure out what works and
what doesn't work, what enables teams,

152
00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:54.350
individuals, and the organization as
a whole to collaborate more effectively is

153
00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:57.420
really where my passion and
interest in this field lies.

154
00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:59.860
>> Yeah, and
I think my motivation is fairly similar.

155
00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:03.890
I mean I came at this from a study
of employment relations and

156
00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:06.600
there I really got into this because I
think many of the things that Cade's

157
00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.980
talking about that struck me.

158
00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:10.250
Where do we spend our time?

159
00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:10.810
At work.

160
00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:13.740
Where does our money come
from that enables us to live?

161
00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:14.380
At work.

162
00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:18.440
Who produces staff,
people in jobs within organizations and

163
00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:21.730
so to kind of, for me in order to
understand what makes a good society or

164
00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:25.350
bad society is really now how
well does employment work?

165
00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:26.490
How well is it organized?

166
00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:31.270
Certainly the hope is that by better
analytics, putting better data,

167
00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:34.540
we can make better decisions, which would
obviously be good for organizations,

168
00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:39.440
but hopefully a big part of this will
also be providing better places for

169
00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:42.370
people to work where they will enjoy
their work more and get more out of it.

170
00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:44.440
So that's my hope for this field.
