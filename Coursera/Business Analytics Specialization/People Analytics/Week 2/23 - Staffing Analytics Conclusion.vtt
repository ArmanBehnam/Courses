00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.450
And so what I've tried to emphasize
over the course of this module

2
00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.700
is the different ways in which
bringing data to the question

3
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.030
can inform how we make some of the most
important staffing decisions that not only

4
00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.050
shape how people perform in their jobs,
but shape their careers as well.

5
00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.600
Ever since there have been organizations
we've been doing this based on instinct,

6
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.860
hunch, and so on.

7
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.590
Now that we have so much data about what
people are doing, strong analytical tools,

8
00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.350
there really is the opportunity to
bring more rigor to the process,

9
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:32.820
make it more data driven.

10
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.070
And certainly, all of the early
evidence suggests that doing so

11
00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.880
improves the quality of
decisions that we make,

12
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.870
helping us get the right
people into the right jobs.

13
00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.210
Helping them stay there in ways that again
are gonna help the organizations and

14
00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.740
also gonna make for better careers for
the people within them.
