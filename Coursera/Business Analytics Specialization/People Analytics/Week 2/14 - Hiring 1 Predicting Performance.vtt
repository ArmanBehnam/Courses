1
00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.850
So in this segment I want
to talk about hiring,

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.130
the process of getting people into jobs.

3
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.040
If you think about hiring
in most organizations,

4
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.350
it's pretty clear that sometimes we do
it well and sometimes we do it badly.

5
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.050
If you Google online you'll
see a lot of statistics,

6
00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:17.610
about maybe half of all new hires fail.

7
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.420
It's never been clear to me where
they get those statistics from, but

8
00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.290
it's certainly the case that we
can see in most organizations.

9
00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:26.520
We hire a bunch of people,
some of them work out, some of them don't.

10
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.830
A lot of people leave their jobs
fairly quickly which suggest

11
00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:30.920
this was not a good match.

12
00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.830
And so, it's done fairly
imperfectly pretty much everywhere.

13
00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:37.930
When you think about what hiring is

14
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.960
there are a bunch of different
ways of thinking about it.

15
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.920
So often we think about it as a match.

16
00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.260
It's almost like dating.

17
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.240
It's finding the right chemistry.

18
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.100
And that's usually influential
in how people actually hire.

19
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.580
From an analytic standpoint though,

20
00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.200
the way that we think about hiring
is about predicting performance.

21
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.030
We have a lot of people who
are applying to the job.

22
00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.330
What we want to know is who's
going to perform best in it?

23
00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.870
And so
all of the effort goes into figuring out

24
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:12.090
what predicts high performance, so that
we can then screen on those attributes.

25
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.970
What I've got here is a list of
different things that companies use in

26
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.000
order to try and screen applicants, to try
and understand what their performance is.

27
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.340
So we see things like job knowledge tests,
cognitive ability tests.

28
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.900
use personality test, reference checks,
structured interviews, unstructured

29
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.940
interviews, work samples, integra test,
a wide variety of things that can

30
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.470
be used to try and get at this question,
who is going to perform well in the job?

31
00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.730
Question that we have to ask
then is which of these are best?

32
00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.260
So, if we're thinking about
assessing candidates.

33
00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.870
Which of these should we be using and
which of them shouldn't we be using?

34
00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.730
So as you look at that list.

35
00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:56.350
What do you think are some of the thing
that are gonna be most effective at

36
00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:57.470
predicting performance?

37
00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:00.270
Had a chance to look at it?

38
00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.770
Think about it a little.

39
00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.450
Okay, well let's see what actually works.

40
00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.030
So what I've got here
are a series of correlations.

41
00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.280
So I don't know how much you
know about statistics, and

42
00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.300
one thing that I'm going to say repeatedly
during this module, is that if you

43
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.630
haven't taken a course on statistics and
you're interested in this topic.

44
00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.080
I really strongly recommend that you
take a couple of introductory courses in

45
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.270
statistics, because they're sort of
the complement to what we're doing.

46
00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.930
You want to understand the people
side of analytics, and

47
00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.120
how to apply analytics to people but
statistics just

48
00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.650
gives you an understanding of some of
the ways of interpreting the results.

49
00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.960
And for those of you who
haven't done this recently,

50
00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.940
correlation is basically a measure of
how closely two variables move together.

51
00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.200
So correlation of zero means these things
are totally unrelated to one another

52
00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.870
of correlation of one means they
move together perfectly that

53
00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.000
they could almost be the same thing.

54
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.100
And where they fall in that spectrum
tells you how closely they're correlated.

55
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.510
And so what you see in this graph
is a variety of correlations.

56
00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.580
The largest correlations are the things
that are doing the best job of predicting

57
00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:08.108
performance.

58
00:03:08.108 --> 00:03:12.210
Correlation of .5 is quite strong,
it's, again, not 1.

59
00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.320
It's not a 1 to 1 correspondence, but

60
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.840
it tells you this is quite good
at predicting performance.

61
00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.330
When we get down to kind of,
.2, .3, that's a lot weaker.

62
00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:26.070
And so, what we've done here
is we've listed in order

63
00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:30.690
how the various different assessment
techniques actually predict performance.

64
00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.750
So if you got it right, congratulations.

65
00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.070
Give yourself a pat on the back as long
as you're not carrying anything heavy or

66
00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:38.550
something like that.

67
00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.430
If you got it wrong, I'm sorry,
but better luck next time.

68
00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.610
Anyway, if you go through what you see,
is that there are a number of things

69
00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.930
that really do predict
performance quite effectively.

70
00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.640
So more than anything else,
perhaps not surprisingly is work samples.

71
00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.530
And so some companies, when they hire,
they ask people to either produce, or

72
00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.850
perform something like the work
that they're going to do.

73
00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.610
So for example, technical writers.

74
00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.520
Maybe you'll give them
a description of your product and

75
00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.200
ask them to give us a sample
of writing about it.

76
00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.600
I heard companies hiring analysts,

77
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.800
maybe we'll send them a spreadsheet
of data and ask them to analyze it.

78
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.120
Just getting a sense of, can they perform
the job they're being asked to do.

79
00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.090
Another thing that is surprising,
I would say affective,

80
00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:19.560
is congnative ability testing.

81
00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.730
It turns out that actually, general
intelligence is really quite predictive

82
00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:26.570
of performance in a very
wide range of jobs.

83
00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:31.210
And so some organizations will actually
have candidates do something that looks

84
00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:36.050
like an IQ test, if intelligence
is something they care about and

85
00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:40.010
drives performance,
it's the easiest way to measure it okay?

86
00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.480
Third thing that we've seen is very
effective is structured interviews.

87
00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.430
What's the difference between
a structured interview and

88
00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.220
an unstructured interview that
comes down at the bottom?

89
00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.860
An unstructured interview is
really when we meet somebody, and

90
00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.830
we talk to them, and we try and
get a sense of Who they are,

91
00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.510
what they're like, what their
strengths and weaknesses might be.

92
00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.020
We all think we're good
judges of character.

93
00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.080
It turns out, we're not.

94
00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.170
So, I don't know if you've read,
it's a marvelous book.

95
00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:15.100
Thinking Fast, Thinking Slow,
by Daniel Kahneman.

96
00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.690
You get a chance,
you should really look at it

97
00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:21.760
Carniman is a Nobel prize winning
psychologist, which is quite a neat trick,

98
00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.500
since there isn't actually
a Nobel prize in Psychology.

99
00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.090
He won it for Economics.

100
00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:28.670
He has done a lot of work on biases and
characteristics.

101
00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:32.820
He tells this lovely story about
the first job that he ever had.

102
00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:36.140
So he was working with
the Israeli defense forces, and

103
00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:40.920
his job as a psychologist was to try and
assess candidates for officer training.

104
00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:44.000
And so they had this exercise where
they would get these candidates

105
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.870
carrying this large log, and say, okay,
you've got get all of you candidates, and

106
00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:53.140
this log, over a six foot wall,
and neither you nor

107
00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:57.040
the log can touch the wall at any point,
and the log can't touch the ground.

108
00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:02.470
And the idea was that psychologists would
stand around and watch them as they try.

109
00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:05.350
And so you'd see some people would try and

110
00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:07.415
organize people that
come up with the ideas.

111
00:06:07.415 --> 00:06:10.390
So coordinate,
other people might hang back,

112
00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:14.630
some people get very annoyed
when their ideas got ignored.

113
00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:17.040
In other cases you'd see
when it was going wrong.

114
00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:20.270
Some people would give up, but
others would really step forward and

115
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:22.570
start trying to organize people.

116
00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:23.830
They figured, based on this,

117
00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:26.620
you'd get a really good sense
of people's leadership ability.

118
00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:28.860
And so, they would rate people, and

119
00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:31.960
make recommendations about who
should go to officer's training.

120
00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.490
The interesting thing
about the story is that

121
00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:37.440
they actually knew how good
their assessment were.

122
00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:41.490
They could see the end as people
went through officer training

123
00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:43.590
who actually turned out
to be good at this.

124
00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:48.220
And they discovered there was almost no
correlation between what they thought

125
00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:51.410
based on kind of what seemed
like a good set of test, and

126
00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:53.300
how people actually performed.

127
00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:59.220
What was really scary to Kahneman was
that even though over time they learnt

128
00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:04.330
that this test was in no was predictive
of performance, nonetheless for

129
00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:08.720
each individual they still felt very
confident in making a prediction.

130
00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:12.260
Okay we know in general this doesn't work,
but we know this guy is going to make it.

131
00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.450
This guy definitely not going to make it.

132
00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:16.340
And he calls this
the illusion of validity,

133
00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:21.340
a sense that we think we know much
more about people than we actually do.

134
00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:24.080
And the challenge with on structured
interviews when we sit down and

135
00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.960
we talk to people, and try and
figure out what they're like

136
00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:29.210
is really giving into
the illusion of validity,right,

137
00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:33.730
we don't know learn very much, but
whatever biases, prejudices we have.

138
00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:37.370
They fill up the whole room in our mind
in terms of actually judging them.

139
00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:41.110
So unstructured interviews are found
to be really pretty bad at predicting

140
00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:43.840
what people are going to do and
how they are going to perform.

141
00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:48.960
Structured interviews, on the other hand,
are when actually interviews are designed

142
00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:53.590
to assess specific characteristics
of the individual, and

143
00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:58.600
get at whether or not they have
the attributes needed for the job.

144
00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:00.040
They're found to be fairly predictive.

145
00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:03.760
On the other end of the scale, I think
something that often surprises people is

146
00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:06.490
how ineffective reference checks are.

147
00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:10.180
We have a sense that if we ask
people who know the candidate,

148
00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:13.570
they should really be able
to tell us how they perform.

149
00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:15.110
There are a couple of problems with this.

150
00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:18.740
I mean there are certainly legal issues in
the U.S. now, which is companies are very

151
00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:22.340
afraid of giving negative references
because they might be sued.

152
00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:27.430
On top of that, and certainly having read
a lot of reference letters over the years.

153
00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:31.020
You realize that most of what
drives the quality of a reference

154
00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:33.740
is actually the person
writing the reference, right.

155
00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:38.010
How happy they are to lie outrageously on
somebody else's behalf to help them get

156
00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:41.920
a job, and when you're trying to predict
performance, and most of the variations in

157
00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:45.210
your measure is being driven by
the person writing the reference.

158
00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:47.080
Rather than the person
the reference is about,

159
00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:50.190
is going to be quite a poor measure
of their future performance.
