1
00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:04.430
The third area of staffing that people
spend a lot of time thinking about

2
00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:06.170
is attrition, and it makes sense.

3
00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.870
You spend a lot of time and effort
making sure you hired the right people.

4
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.080
You're then worried about
are they in the right job,

5
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.360
how do we promote them, and so on.

6
00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.890
Well, having got them there,
you kind of want them to stay in the job

7
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.490
Certainly organizations have discovered
that turnover is very costly.

8
00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.120
Why, because of all
the things that it leads to.

9
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.850
So what does turnover lead to.

10
00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:27.530
It lead to increase hiring costs.

11
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.640
Okay, you've gotta replace the people.

12
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.400
You've then gotta train the new people
in the kind of skills that the people

13
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.060
who left had.

14
00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.860
And then there's gonna be a bunch of
things that you can't even train.

15
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.460
Some of the unique knowledge that somebody
had built up over years, at least months

16
00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.150
of working there, which then has to be
relearned or maybe is never reacquired.

17
00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.510
And then, on top of that, there are the
relationships that they had built up,

18
00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.500
both with their colleagues that made
the work easier, and also with customers.

19
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.220
And so we know turnover impacts
productivity, it impacts quality, and

20
00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.470
it impacts customer relationships.

21
00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.610
And there have been a wide variety of
studies that demonstrate a strong negative

22
00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.300
effects of performance on work group
performance and profitability.

23
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.840
So this is something you really
want to worry about as a manager.

24
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.740
Of course, in order for
finding out more about it to be valuable,

25
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.080
they need to be things you can
actually do with that knowledge.

26
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.280
And there are when you know more about it,

27
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.070
you can pull the levers to reduce
turnover more effectively.

28
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.880
So, in particular,
when we know who leaves and

29
00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.360
why, that can inform our hiring decisions.

30
00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.940
One of the easiest ways to
address a turnover problem

31
00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.660
is by looking at your hiring.

32
00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.260
Are we bringing in people who
are likely to be leaving?

33
00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.190
The same time we can think about what
kinds of interventions we want to make

34
00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:43.900
inside the organization.

35
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.860
Certain groups are much
more likely to leave,

36
00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.060
are there needs of those
that are being unmet?

37
00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.820
Is there something about the conditions
of those jobs, either pay or

38
00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:58.530
the work itself, that we can really
change in order to address turnover.

39
00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.150
Sometimes we find there are particular
managers who seem to have a problem.

40
00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.440
Either we can move them out or
we can train them, and

41
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.370
help them think about how to mitigate and
reduce that turnover.

42
00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.900
Okay?

43
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:13.430
And more broadly the extent to which we're
gonna spend time and money on retention,

44
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:19.020
figuring out who our biggest flight risks
are will help us in targeting that money,

45
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.090
and that effort effectively.

46
00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.430
So I wanna spend a couple of minutes just
thinking about why do people leave, and

47
00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.640
how's that going to help us
understand the drives of it?

48
00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.120
The simplest view of a attrition is
obviously that people leave their jobs

49
00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.095
when they find something else
that they would rather be doing.

50
00:02:38.095 --> 00:02:42.150
That' s the kind of depth of insight they
pay off the academics the big bucks for.

51
00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.250
If you think about that,

52
00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.630
then there are two things that are really
going to drive whether or not people stay.

53
00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:50.440
Okay?

54
00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.750
One is the attractiveness of
the outside opportunities.

55
00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.160
And so
you will see attrition is highly cyclical.

56
00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.660
When the economy is doing well and

57
00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.780
there are more job opportunities outside,
people will leave more.

58
00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.800
It's also gonna affect who leaves.

59
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.070
Those jobs which are in high demand,
where it's easier for

60
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.750
people to move to industries
that are growing rapidly and

61
00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.870
have a lot of jobs,
those are gonna see high attrition.

62
00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.370
And there may also be
reasons that people leave,

63
00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.130
because they just plan that they
want to move on to the next thing.

64
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.890
So the attractiveness of
those things drives it.

65
00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.800
On the other hand the fact that something
is more attractive in your current job

66
00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.920
may say something about your current job.

67
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.900
So the less happy you
are with the existing job

68
00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.210
the more likely you are to move.

69
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:36.240
So things about your satisfaction today,
or your satisfaction with

70
00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:41.180
kind of your future trajectory It's going
to tell you something about who leaves.

71
00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.560
As you think about what it
is that makes people leave.

72
00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.940
What would be some of the things in
terms of the current job that you would

73
00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.020
think would be the most important?

74
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.100
Any thoughts, anybody?

75
00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.200
Anybody?
I am going

76
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.430
to have to start cold calling soon.

77
00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.360
So what we see here again,

78
00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.960
some of the correlations between how
people perceive their jobs in turnover.

79
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.230
So, what people do in this studies,
is they go out and they survey people,

80
00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.670
how do you feel about
various aspects of your job?

81
00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.492
And then, they come back six months or
a year later say, okay who left?

82
00:04:13.327 --> 00:04:16.290
The truism here is of people
you've managed jobs and

83
00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.440
there's some evidence for this.

84
00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.790
The quality of the relationship that
people report with their supervisor,

85
00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:26.930
the highest correlate among these
different factors in terms of

86
00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.580
correlating with turnover.

87
00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.890
People leave when they
dislike their manager,

88
00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:32.990
and that we've certainly seen the data.

89
00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.140
They're not happy with their job,
they leave.

90
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:39.180
There's conflicting roles one
of the things that's interesting

91
00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.730
is the pay is not that strongly
correlated with turnover.

92
00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.680
We kinda think people take jobs and
stay in jobs for money.

93
00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.860
It's certainly true, but it has
a surprising weak effect in these studies.

94
00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.940
I'm not sure exactly
where that comes from.

95
00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.690
It's certainly, I always say this is
a slide not to share with your manager.

96
00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:59.220
You always want them to think unless
you get a really large raise,

97
00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.170
you're definitely going to leave.

98
00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:07.200
I certainly also think when organizations
mess up how they pay people,

99
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.960
if people feel unrewarded, and
certainly if they think it's unfair,

100
00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:16.190
that's a huge trigger of attrition, but
it doesn't seem to be the main driver.

101
00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.780
The other thing that I would say
about these correlations is none of

102
00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:26.790
them are super high, okay, so
we see a correlation of 0.25.

103
00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:28.950
That's a reasonable size, but

104
00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:35.520
it says most people how satisfied
they are with their supervisor.

105
00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.270
It's not gonna tell you a great
deal about how they leave.

106
00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.870
On average, if we don't like our
supervisor, we're more likely to leave.

107
00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:43.230
There are a lot of people who hate their
supervisors who are going to stay.

108
00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:46.840
There are a lot of people who really like
their supervisors who are going to leave,

109
00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:51.570
and so, how much we like our job affects
turnover but it's not the only thing.

110
00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:54.530
One way to understand
that is by thinking about

111
00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:56.800
what actually happens when people leave.

112
00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.170
So another way people have looked at
turnover is just the process people take.

113
00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:04.890
So if you think back on that moment when
you walk into your boss's office and say,

114
00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:08.390
that's it, I'm done,
what leads up to that.

115
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:09.480
So most commonly

116
00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:14.070
It's gonna be that you have another
job alternative that you prefer.

117
00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:17.700
And so you've compared your
current job to an alternative and

118
00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:19.990
you've decided I'm gonna leave.

119
00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:20.900
How would you've got there?

120
00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:26.460
Well sometimes somebody might of
called you and just offer you a job.

121
00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:30.050
And said, either a recruiter or
a friend, why don't you come work here?

122
00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:33.560
And you look and you said,
wow that seems really good, lets do that.

123
00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.650
You know, more commonly presumably,

124
00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:37.590
you've actually done that cuz
you've been searching for a job.

125
00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:40.360
So somewhere along the line you
decided to search for a job.

126
00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:43.590
Why did you decide to search for a job?

127
00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:45.220
Again, there could be multiple reasons for
that.

128
00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:49.340
So the most common is probably
that you don't like your job, but

129
00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:53.110
it might also be that you've heard
that all of your friends are going and

130
00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:56.270
getting great pay raises and
great jobs In new firms and

131
00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:59.350
you think, maybe that means I
should look around as well.

132
00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:04.280
There are other paths as well so
some people may have said

133
00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:07.540
after three year I going to graduate
school, and so that's not going

134
00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:10.660
to have very much to do with how they
feel about their job or the alternatives.

135
00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:13.390
Of course some people might
just walk into the office and

136
00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:16.740
say, I quit without even having
thought About an alternative job.

137
00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:20.970
Basic point here, so lots of different
ways this decision is made and

138
00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:22.590
different considerations in each of them.

139
00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:24.969
And so
maybe we shouldn't be that surprised,

140
00:07:24.969 --> 00:07:28.690
that the satisfaction with our job and
the satisfaction with our manager

141
00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:32.045
drives some of our decisions to quit,
but sometimes other things

142
00:07:32.045 --> 00:07:36.272
happen in our lives that make us decide to
move that has very little to do with that.

143
00:07:36.272 --> 00:07:41.195
And so any one explanation of it's
probably only gonna explain what

144
00:07:41.195 --> 00:07:44.050
goes on for fairly small number of people.

145
00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:47.310
And so, you're gonna there are people
who love their job but quit anyway.

146
00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:49.990
And there are people who hate their
job but when they go out, and

147
00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:53.360
compare it with alternatives they decide
that there's nothing better that they

148
00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.000
can do,and they stay.

149
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.040
A third way in which people think
about this process of leaving,

150
00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:03.390
is basically in terms of search, and
so this very much comes from economics

151
00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:06.920
where people think there are lots of
different jobs that we could be doing,

152
00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:10.120
and we're gonna enjoy those
jobs to a different extent

153
00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:14.350
based on how well they fit our preferences
and also how good we are at them.

154
00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:20.460
The catch here is that it's
often difficult to know

155
00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:24.610
how much we're going to like
a job until we've done it, okay?

156
00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:27.840
So we may have some ideas about
what we want to do with our lives.

157
00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:31.120
I can say for a start,
I never expected to be an academic.

158
00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:33.960
I always thought I was gonna be a manager,
consultant,

159
00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:36.200
something like that,
then I actually tried those jobs.

160
00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.360
I was like, wow, this is hard.

161
00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.200
Maybe just studying other
people would be easier.

162
00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:43.580
And so we learn over time what
it is that we're good at and

163
00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:46.080
what it is that we enjoy,
and we learn by doing.

164
00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:54.100
What that means is that people move across
jobs until they find one that they like,

165
00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:58.470
and then they stick, and a lot of
turnover reflects the search process.

166
00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:01.420
The reason this is useful is it
gives us some other insights into

167
00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:03.520
who's gonna stay and who's gonna leave.

168
00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:08.650
So, in particular, people are more
likely to leave earlier in the job.

169
00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:10.620
We move into a job, we decide.

170
00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:11.500
Is this a good job for me?

171
00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:13.060
Is this a bad job for me?

172
00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:17.040
If it's a good job we stay, and
after a while we've made that decision so

173
00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:18.430
we're not going to change our mind.

174
00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:22.410
So people tend to leave fairly early in
the jobs when turnover rates highest,

175
00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:25.500
people figure out whether or
not it's a good job for us.

176
00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:28.760
The other thing that it suggests
is that turnover tends to fall

177
00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:31.300
as workers get older, okay?

178
00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:32.400
So early on in our career,

179
00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:34.970
we don't really have a good idea of
what we like, what we're good at.

180
00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:37.620
We'll hop around jobs a bit
while we figure it out.

181
00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:39.100
Later on we've got more information.

182
00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:41.070
We've tried a few things.

183
00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:43.840
We're narrowing down what it is that
we like and what we don't like.

184
00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:47.310
And so the chances that we're gonna
be in a job that isn't very good for

185
00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:49.450
us are lower, and so turnover goes down.

186
00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:53.540
Certainly, what you see
a lot at the moment

187
00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:55.580
is managers complaining about millennials.

188
00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:59.950
So there's this concern that all these
people, they won't stick in the same job,

189
00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:01.160
they're endlessly job hopping.

190
00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.450
What are we going to do about this?

191
00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:07.480
This is part of the general trend that old
people always complain about young people.

192
00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:08.660
This isn't about millennials.

193
00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:12.450
Millennials actually don't move
jobs much more than people

194
00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:15.340
of previous generations did,
when they were that age.

195
00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:17.870
So people in their 20s, they always move.

196
00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:21.780
And so as you think about turnover, some
of these considerations are ones that want

197
00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:24.680
to be in the back of your mind,
as you think about analyzing it.
