00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:03.770
Second topic that I want to
talk about around staffing and

2
00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.400
focus on in this segment
is internal mobility.

3
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.520
So once we've hired people, it's not
the end of the story for staffing.

4
00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.330
A lot of people move jobs
inside the organization.

5
00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.080
Figuring out how we can
optimize that process and

6
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.550
make sure we get the right
people into the right jobs.

7
00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.840
Is somewhere else where
analytics can help.

8
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.700
And kind of a motivating idea for this
is getting beyond the Peter Principle.

9
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.190
So I don't know if many of you
are familiar with the Peter Principle.

10
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:34.890
So, one statement of it is, in time,
every post in an organization

11
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.000
is occupied by an employee who is
incompetent to carry out its duties.

12
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.130
Sometimes also summarized as people rise
to the level of their own incompetence.

13
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.520
It's kind of a cynical idea,
delightfully cynical.

14
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.140
But it's actually an intriguing
theory behind it and the basic idea

15
00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.280
is in most organizations what gets
you promoted is how well you perform.

16
00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.590
And so people who do well in their jobs
eventually will get promoted out of them.

17
00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.240
Now, in an organization that
isn't aggressive about moving

18
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:06.840
underperformers out.

19
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.310
What, eventually, that means,

20
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.270
is people will keep getting promoted
until they hit a job that they can't do.

21
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.160
And then they're not gonna
get promoted out of that job,

22
00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.260
and they're gonna stay in it, as well.

23
00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.630
And as Peter and his co-author, Hull said,
consequence of that is ultimately,

24
00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.450
we end up in organizations that
are largely staffed with people,

25
00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.320
who've risen to a level within
a job they can't actually do.

26
00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.110
So, it's not clear that this really
describes most organizations, but

27
00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.830
I probably won't share it
with your boss anyway.

28
00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.280
Nonetheless, it carries kind of
a grain of an interesting question,

29
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.400
which is to what extent does
success in a current job

30
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.910
actually predict performance
in the next job?

31
00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.150
Should we be screening just for

32
00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.600
are you good at your current job
when we think about who to promote?

33
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.720
Or another way of thinking about this

34
00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.000
is what does predicts
success in higher level jobs?

35
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.290
Should we just be thinking
about are you good at your job?

36
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.100
Or should we be looking
at other things as well?

37
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.940
I think this is not an easy thing to
actually look at in many organizations.

38
00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:15.300
The reason for this is that in most
organizations, you often don't know a lot

39
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.380
about people's performance in their jobs,
at least at the level at which you can

40
00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.040
kind of put it down into
a systematic form and analyze it.

41
00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.810
You have a performance evaluation
that says they're a high performer,

42
00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.150
they're middle of the road,
or they're a low performer.

43
00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.550
What you really want to be
able to do is more detailed

44
00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.510
data on how they're performing
across multiple dimensions.

45
00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:37.950
So you do see that in some jobs.

46
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.850
Like I said,
if you're in a call center, for

47
00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.840
example, there's usually a wide variety of
information about kind of your efficiency,

48
00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.210
your quality, your availability,
all of those sorts of things.

49
00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:50.220
Sales, jobs,

50
00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.730
you can see quite a lot about the
different kinds of sales you're making.

51
00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.630
These days I think in a lot of
jobs we'll begin seeing more and

52
00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.920
more data being collected automatically.

53
00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.610
They enable us to see how people
are doing on varied things.

54
00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.390
Another way that you might have varied
data on your people is where people rated

55
00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.400
on various competencies
in the organization.

56
00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.740
You wanna be a little careful with that,
certainly, when I've looked at that data,

57
00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.460
what tends to happen is that high
flyers get rated as high on pretty much

58
00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.950
everything and low performers get rated
as low on pretty much everything.

59
00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.700
So how well that competence they'd really
tracks variation in individual competence?

60
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.250
I think it's more of question.

61
00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.870
But you can also have formal assessments
done on them that really try and

62
00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.690
individually look at these
different competences.

63
00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.100
The idea is if you could rate people on
various dimensions of their performance

64
00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.240
inside the organization.

65
00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.950
Then what you could do
is look at whether or

66
00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.920
not that performance predicts how
they would do at the next level.

67
00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.130
And more specifically, which dimensions
of their current performance predict

68
00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.760
whether they are going to be a high
performer in a high level job.

69
00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.290
Alan Benson at the University
of Minnesota and

70
00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.590
his colleagues did a very nice study on
this looking at data on sales people.

71
00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.740
They had data on how
the sales people did and

72
00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:08.810
also on the ones that became
sales managers, how they did.

73
00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.100
As they could look at both what predicted
whether or not people got promoted and

74
00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:18.310
also what predicted the performance of
the managers once they became managers.

75
00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.330
And they found some evidence there.

76
00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:23.395
You get promoted by being
the best sells person.

77
00:04:23.395 --> 00:04:27.325
But the best sales managers were good at
selling, but they were also very good at

78
00:04:27.325 --> 00:04:31.485
team sales and sales that spread
credit across their team.

79
00:04:31.485 --> 00:04:34.100
Because to be a good manager you
need to be a team person there.

80
00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.155
And so it really looked like
the way people were being promoted

81
00:04:37.155 --> 00:04:40.105
was not entirely consistent with
who's gonna be the best manager.

82
00:04:40.105 --> 00:04:42.840
And it's likely that's a feature
of many organizations.

83
00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.586
So getting better understanding what makes
people best in the high level jobs and

84
00:04:47.586 --> 00:04:52.260
how we can use that to promote people,
not just on their current performance but

85
00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.570
on their potential would
benefit many organizations.
