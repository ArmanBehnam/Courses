1
00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.670
>> And so, we know already that,
in general, different test are more

2
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.430
versus less effective of predicting how a
candidate is going to perform on the job.

3
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.220
What people analytics allows us to do,
is go beyond this general, and

4
00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:18.850
start thinking for this specific job,

5
00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.250
what do we know about what makes
people effective and what doesn't?

6
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.240
So, in particular, with people analytics,

7
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.180
what we're usually trying to do with
hiring is takes people's performance,

8
00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.060
how do they do at their job, and
try to understand what drives that.

9
00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.010
And so, on the one hand we look at
a variety of performance measures.

10
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.993
And I think both Kade and Martine
are talking a little bit about some of

11
00:00:41.993 --> 00:00:45.760
the challenges of using
performance appraisals.

12
00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.930
We know that these are not great.

13
00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.550
There's probably some
information in there.

14
00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.220
And so, predicting who is likely
to get rated as high versus

15
00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.520
low at least tells us who's gonna be
seen as fitting in in this organization.

16
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.390
On top of that, there are other things
that you might want to predict about

17
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.460
who's going to be a high performer.

18
00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.590
So, increasingly in organizations,
there's a lot of objective information.

19
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.050
Obviously, if it's a sales job,

20
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.269
you can think about who's
going to have the most sales.

21
00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:13.800
Call centers.

22
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.290
You now have huge amounts of data about
things like what people's average handle

23
00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:19.920
time is.

24
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.040
Absenteeism.

25
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.430
Their availability.

26
00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.715
We also have quality assurance.

27
00:01:25.715 --> 00:01:27.245
We have customer satisfaction service.

28
00:01:27.245 --> 00:01:30.795
And so, in some organizations you
have a great deal of information

29
00:01:30.795 --> 00:01:34.005
about each individual on a more
kind of objective basis.

30
00:01:34.005 --> 00:01:36.915
There are other things we also might
want to be able to predict about people.

31
00:01:36.915 --> 00:01:40.075
So, attrition for example,
is a fairly hard measure.

32
00:01:40.075 --> 00:01:42.755
Tells you something about who fit and
who didn't.

33
00:01:42.755 --> 00:01:44.780
It can be important in its own right.

34
00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.110
So, there's some organizations that
spend a lot of money training people.

35
00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.370
If that's the case,

36
00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.660
one of the important things you
wanna think about in your hiring is,

37
00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:56.160
is this person going to stay long enough
for us to get a return on our investment.

38
00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.860
You may also be interested in
understanding who the people

39
00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.030
are promotable.

40
00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.360
So, the idea is we say, okay,

41
00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.390
we want to know who's going to do
well on these various measures.

42
00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.570
And we want to figure out among
the people who are replying

43
00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:09.800
which are gonna be the best bets.

44
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.140
And so, what you do is you
use those as kind of your

45
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.410
variables that you're trying to predict.

46
00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.940
And then,
on the other side you put a series

47
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.530
of characteristics of the individual that
you know at the time they're applying,

48
00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.520
say which of these actually
predicts performance?

49
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.490
So, one of these you might look at
is the resume, their background,

50
00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.500
their characteristics, and so on.

51
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.140
So, one of the things that Google has been
a pioneer in this area found out when they

52
00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:40.150
did this was that they had been
famously for years asking for college

53
00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.980
transcripts for everybody from junior to
senior people and looking at their GPAs.

54
00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.150
When they actually sat down and
looked at what predicted performance,

55
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.150
they found that once people
had been out of college for

56
00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.790
more than a couple of years, GPA had
no value whatsoever as a predictor.

57
00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.640
And so, they said, okay, this is not
something we should be screening on.

58
00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.864
Interestingly, apparently another
investment bank did this recently and

59
00:03:01.864 --> 00:03:05.760
actually they found in their case
GPA was predictive of performance.

60
00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.080
Which speaks, in part,

61
00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.740
to the value of doing this in different
ways in different organizations.

62
00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.350
Because what predicts performance
is going to depend in part

63
00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:14.760
on the nature of the role.

64
00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.300
Another thing that you might
look at is test scores.

65
00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.280
So, if you run a series of intelligence
tests, personality tests, job knowledge

66
00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.590
tests, and so on, which of those are going
to predict who performs well on the job.

67
00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.460
And then you can also look at interviews.

68
00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.850
So, in a structured interview, like I say,
rather than just sitting down,

69
00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:37.140
getting to know somebody, what you're
really trying to do is figure out

70
00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.210
where they score on the various
different attributes.

71
00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:44.420
And so, you should have a series of
questions that are aimed to tap into those

72
00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.890
attributes where you can rate them kind
of high, medium, low on that attribute.

73
00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.100
There's then the possibility to go back
after a year or two and say, okay,

74
00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:59.290
which of these questions and types of
questions actually seems to predict

75
00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.710
whether or not they're going to do
well on the job and which don't.

76
00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.850
Again, another nice story that Google
shared with the public, they were famous

77
00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:11.920
for a series of questions that basically
asked people to think out of the box.

78
00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.980
So, these kind of, how many golf
balls could you fit in a jumbo jet?

79
00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.340
How many call boxes
are there in Manhattan?

80
00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:24.020
I remember when I was applying to
consulting jobs about 20 years ago,

81
00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.560
somebody asked me how many ties are sold
in Great Britain in the average year.

82
00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.090
I just thought, who knows?

83
00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.640
The idea of these is not that you know
the answer, but rather that you try and

84
00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.960
think through and
that they can kind of stump you and

85
00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.230
see how you respond to a question
you haven't thought about before.

86
00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:42.400
Can you be creative?

87
00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.280
Can you structure an answer thoroughly,
all those sorts of things.

88
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.950
And so, it's this nice idea behind it.

89
00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.180
We can really see how smart people are.

90
00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.950
Again, turned out not to work at all.

91
00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.520
Completely unpredictive of performance.

92
00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.640
And so, on the base of that, they're
trying to move away from these questions,

93
00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:59.460
persuade people not to ask them.

94
00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.870
So, you can figure out what
kind of questions work.

95
00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:06.330
You can also start even to look at which
interviewers have done a better job

96
00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.830
of predicting who's going to be
a high performer and who isn't.

97
00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:13.252
And the idea is on the base of this
variable to choose who interviews and

98
00:05:13.252 --> 00:05:15.430
even what kind of tests we use.

99
00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:17.420
Some people have gone even further.

100
00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:21.800
So, JetBlue told a very nice story about
how they are using these analytics.

101
00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.790
When they hire flight attendants,
one of the big questions was

102
00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:30.610
is it more important that they're
friendly or that they're helpful?

103
00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.480
Because you can have people who
smile a lot and say nice things, but

104
00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.500
then the person will actually lift your
bag, help you get it up, looks for

105
00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.330
people who actually need assistance and
that sort of thing.

106
00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.760
And so, it really wasn't clear
to them which one was better.

107
00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:44.500
Not clear to me either, although my
colleagues will tell you on either

108
00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.170
basis I am unlikely to
get a job on JetBlue.

109
00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:52.310
When they tried to figure this out, what
they did was they ran a little experiment.

110
00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:56.060
They went and they asked their customers
to rate their flight attendants.

111
00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:57.660
Is this person friendly?

112
00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:58.480
Are they helpful?

113
00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:59.460
What do you think.

114
00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.570
And also to rate their
overall customer experience.

115
00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:05.180
Are they likely to recommend
JetBlue to somebody else?

116
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:06.210
And to see,

117
00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:11.190
was their rating of the airline higher
when the customer was friendly or helpful?

118
00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:14.460
And on this basis they discovered
that actually it's helpfulness

119
00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:15.220
that was more valuable.

120
00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:18.340
And so that enabled them to
further fine tune their hiring.

121
00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:22.430
Once they knew what was really important
in this job, then they could think about

122
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:27.230
how are we going to go out and
actually screen for that.

123
00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:32.400
And so, the idea, then, is basically
to take these predictors and see,

124
00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:36.130
based on what we know about the people in
our organization who are performing well,

125
00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:39.070
which of these predictors
do tell us something

126
00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:41.320
about what people's
performance is likely to be?

127
00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:45.500
In doing this,
there are a few things to bare in mind.

128
00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:46.200
Okay?

129
00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:49.520
First, the most obviously, you want
to be comparing apples with apples.

130
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:53.920
So, if you're looking at differences in
performance, you want to make sure that

131
00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:58.320
people are doing the same work in
the same place, or at the same level.

132
00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:59.260
All of those sorts of things.

133
00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.940
You really want to hold that constant
because, otherwise, it's quite

134
00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:05.800
possible that what you're really seeing is
differences in what people are supposed to

135
00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.970
be doing rather than actually differences
in their attributes driving performance.

136
00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:14.160
A pernicious version of this is you
want to be very wary of time in the job.

137
00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.870
Generally, we expect certainly we
people have been in the job for

138
00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:19.560
a moderate period of time, they're going
to be better at what they are doing.

139
00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:23.840
So, are you really comparing people
new versus medium in the job, or

140
00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:27.080
are you comparing people who are all
in the same job at the same time?

141
00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:31.680
The second thing that you want to be
concerned about, and I'll get into this

142
00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:35.710
in more detail in a minute, is the idea
of of disentangling influences.

143
00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:36.400
Right?

144
00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:40.250
So, often you have multiple
different attributes of people.

145
00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:43.540
So, they vary on their education,

146
00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:47.800
their experience levels,
what it was they were doing.

147
00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:51.089
So, we see their friendliness, their
helpfulness, all of these sorts of things.

148
00:07:51.089 --> 00:07:55.480
And the challenge is if you just
look at one of these variables,

149
00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:57.320
is it that that's predicting performance,
or

150
00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:00.090
is it just that it's highly
correlated with something else.

151
00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:02.870
You wanna disentangle those
influences to make sure you really

152
00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:05.680
are getting at the attributes
that drive performance.

153
00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:09.660
One of the things you wanna do there
as well is probable just apply a bit of

154
00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:10.350
common sense.

155
00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:15.500
If you look at any data set you're gonna
see a bunch of different patterns.

156
00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:16.880
Some of them are gonna be real.

157
00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:19.320
You would see them in
any similar data set.

158
00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:20.370
Some of them are not.

159
00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:23.000
So there are various statistical
techniques for trying to figure out which

160
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.500
are the real ones, but also probably
applying a modicum of common sense.

161
00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:27.510
Does this make sense?

162
00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:31.550
Can we figure out why this would be,
is an important thing to do.

163
00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:35.980
The final, and more tricky piece, is that
it's also worth thinking about what we're

164
00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:40.730
doing here is we're taking the people that
we hired and seeing how does what we knew

165
00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:46.010
about them before we hired them help
predict how they're performing today.

166
00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:50.020
Well, that's not the same sample
as our general applicants.

167
00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:50.570
Okay?

168
00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:54.200
The people who we have now,
we weeded out a bunch.

169
00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:57.242
And so, it's not exactly
the same as predicting who out of

170
00:08:57.242 --> 00:09:00.020
the general applicants will perform well.

171
00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:03.090
It creates a number of
statistical biases that I think,

172
00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:06.310
if you're really serious about this,
you need some attention to.
