00:00:04.796 --> 00:00:09.360
So in this segment I want to talk a little
bit about thinking about causality.

2
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.283
So in any introductory level statistics
course one of the important things that

3
00:00:14.283 --> 00:00:19.511
you learn is to chant correlation is not
causation, correlation is not causation.

4
00:00:19.511 --> 00:00:21.950
It's some sort of
semi-religious incantation.

5
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.870
It's particularly important when
we think about people analytics.

6
00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:27.530
Why is this so important?

7
00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:30.400
When we do people analytics,

8
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.800
it's because we're thinking
of changing something, right?

9
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.830
It's because we're thinking there's
something we could do differently.

10
00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:37.444
So to take some of the topics
we've been talking about.

11
00:00:37.444 --> 00:00:41.610
I talked about different ways
in which you can staff jobs.

12
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.080
Suppose we had found that people who move
jobs through formal posting do worse.

13
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.790
Well, then should we be thinking
about discouraging that posting and

14
00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:50.720
doing more sponsorship?

15
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.790
Suppose as we analyze performance,
we find that people who have

16
00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.210
been the longest in the job
tend to be lower performers.

17
00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.170
Does that mean we should be moving
people around their jobs more so

18
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.890
they don't get stale?

19
00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.130
Suppose we find that people who have
taken a training program perform better,

20
00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.800
well, should we invest more in
training and train more people?

21
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.611
Or even if we find that they have people
who have done a training program,

22
00:01:13.611 --> 00:01:15.488
their performance improves more.

23
00:01:15.488 --> 00:01:18.680
Again, does that suggest
this training program works?

24
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.380
Maybe, but we want to make sure that
other things aren't happening instead.

25
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.210
There are really two types of problems
that we want to be very careful about.

26
00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.030
So one of them is what we call
an omitted variable problem,

27
00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.570
an omitted variable bias.

28
00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.820
So we find that X is associated with Y.

29
00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.870
So, when people have moved
jobs through posting,

30
00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:45.140
which is X, they're more likely
to perform higher, which is Y.

31
00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.210
Does that mean that X causes Y?

32
00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.190
Maybe, but it could also means
there's some third variable,

33
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.890
here O, that is driving both X and Y.

34
00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.980
So I talked about maybe if
we found that posting jobs

35
00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:01.050
was associated with lower performance,
we should do less posting.

36
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:06.300
Well, an alternative explanation is
that the reason that we post jobs

37
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.130
is because they're difficult to fill.

38
00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.520
We don't have people currently who could
do that job that we can identify, so

39
00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.880
we post it to see if
there's anybody out there.

40
00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.620
Well jobs that we don't have people
we can do are probably gonna end up

41
00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:18.650
being performed worse.

42
00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.690
And so it might not be that
the posting's causing the problem, but

43
00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.830
rather the thing that's causing us
to post is causing the problem.

44
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.110
The other thing I talked about is,

45
00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.030
maybe we find people improve
performance after training?

46
00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.560
Seems like good evidence that
training improves performance.

47
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.670
But in the literature on wages and
training,

48
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.350
there's this really interesting
phenomenon called the Ashenfelter Dip.

49
00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.000
Somebody discovered that actually
people's wages tend to dip

50
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.930
before they enter training,
because why do people enter training?

51
00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.280
Because they feel they need to improve.

52
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.330
When they increase afterwards, part of
that is just a reversion to the mean.

53
00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.490
People having temporary problems,
those tend to go away.

54
00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:57.770
It's also when they have training.

55
00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.310
You can imagine the same
thing in your organization.

56
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.040
People have a bad quarter, they get sent
to training, well that bad quarter was

57
00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.010
a bunch of things,
the next quarter's gonna be better, okay?

58
00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.040
It looks like the training's caused
performance, but really it's that

59
00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.440
bad quarter that's causing both
the fact they go to training and

60
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.880
the fact that their performance
looks better next quarter.

61
00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.750
The other big kind of
problem is reverse causality.

62
00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.510
So rather than X causing Y, Y causes X.

63
00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.230
So good performers,

64
00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.570
the fact that people are performing well
causes them to do things differently.

65
00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.278
So, I talked about if we
find that the people who

66
00:03:33.278 --> 00:03:38.390
are performing worse in their roles
are the ones who been there the longest.

67
00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.240
Does that mean we should
rotate people around?

68
00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.946
Does that mean people
are getting stale in their job?

69
00:03:41.946 --> 00:03:43.165
Well, it could do.

70
00:03:43.165 --> 00:03:47.545
But it could also be this kind of
Peter principle that I talked about.

71
00:03:47.545 --> 00:03:51.419
That people who have been in the job for
a while have not been promoted out.

72
00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:54.890
And so they're the lower performers.

73
00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.981
The better performers are the ones
who get promoted out.

74
00:03:57.981 --> 00:04:01.671
And so in that case, performance is
causing people to stay on a job longer,

75
00:04:01.671 --> 00:04:03.379
rather than the other way around.

76
00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:07.957
And similarly, if people tend to
send their best people to training,

77
00:04:07.957 --> 00:04:12.471
then we're likely to see the higher
performers have more training.

78
00:04:12.471 --> 00:04:16.110
That's not the training's improving the
performance, it's the other way around.

79
00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:19.827
Okay, and so a lot of these times what
looks like an obvious inference about

80
00:04:19.827 --> 00:04:23.898
what we should do, may not be if we really
understand the chain of events that's on

81
00:04:23.898 --> 00:04:26.266
the line,
the patterns that we see on our data.

82
00:04:26.266 --> 00:04:29.343
There are a variety of
ways of addressing this.

83
00:04:29.343 --> 00:04:34.537
I think really, the basic question
always that you need to ask when you're

84
00:04:34.537 --> 00:04:40.410
doing this, is what's leading to
difference in our main predictor variable?

85
00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:45.380
Okay, we see in effect of posting,
why are some jobs posted and

86
00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.390
other jobs are filled by sponsorship?

87
00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:50.780
We see in effect of training,
who gets training?

88
00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:53.250
We see in effect of time and

89
00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.710
job, why do some people stay
longer in their jobs than others?

90
00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.220
Without understanding what's
driving those things,

91
00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:05.760
you want to be very cautious about making
kind of a strong argument that those

92
00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:10.530
things are themselves causing performance
or whatever outcome variable you have.
