Hello my name's Matthew Bidwell.

2
00:00:02.316 --> 00:00:07.040
I'm an associate professor of
management at The Wharton School.

3
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.611
My teaching is mainly around topics
about how we manage people, so

4
00:00:10.611 --> 00:00:13.055
I teach in our core class
on managing people.

5
00:00:13.055 --> 00:00:17.295
I also teach an elective on careers and so
it's topics about how people more around

6
00:00:17.295 --> 00:00:20.900
jobs and how they move into jobs
that I'm most interested in.

7
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.260
And particularly how we can bring some
rigor and analysis to those topics.

8
00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.140
So that really has informed the way
I've thought about this people

9
00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.630
analytics topic and what's going
to be most useful for you to know.
