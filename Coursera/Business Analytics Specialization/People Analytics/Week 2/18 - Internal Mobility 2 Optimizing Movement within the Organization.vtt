1
00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:05.310
So a second dimension, of thinking about
how we can bring analytics to Staffing,

2
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.620
is thinking about how we evaluate the
different ways that people can be staffed.

3
00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.800
So, if you think about most jobs,
I have here a representative organization,

4
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:14.550
it's a pyramid.

5
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:21.110
How do people get into these empty jobs,
designated by hollow eggs?

6
00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.295
Well, see one way that people
enter them is by being hired.

7
00:00:25.295 --> 00:00:27.440
Another way is by being promoted.

8
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.210
And a third way that people might
enter jobs, is kind of sideways.

9
00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.910
Now, if I'm a manager and
I'm thinking about staffing.

10
00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.770
A question that I really care about is
what are the trade offs towards this.

11
00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.330
Should I be doing more to
promote internal development and

12
00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.460
promotional mobility,
is that money well spent?

13
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.940
Or would it be better off
spending that money to try and

14
00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.810
beef up our recruitment efforts?

15
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:50.940
Which of these is like
to be more effective?

16
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.040
So this scenario where
I've done some work and

17
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.750
kind of give a little more
detail how you do this analysis.

18
00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:03.072
So I took a bunch of data from
a division of a large investment bank.

19
00:01:03.072 --> 00:01:06.323
Basically, just told me how people
were performing in their jobs and

20
00:01:06.323 --> 00:01:09.140
how they were paid in kind of
snapshots year by year by year.

21
00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.440
And so you could go through this and
pull out for each person, okay,

22
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.090
how did they get into that job?

23
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.415
Were they hired into it?

24
00:01:16.415 --> 00:01:19.350
Did they come from a lower level job
in the organization, being promoted?

25
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.960
Do they come from somewhere else in
the firm, were they being transferred?

26
00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.030
And then see which of those shapes,
the various performance metrics,

27
00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.510
as well as how they're paid, okay?

28
00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.740
Now in doing this there are a bunch
of things that I was worried about.

29
00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.100
So one is, obviously everybody gets
hired at some stage, so kind of

30
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.380
worry about what happens after somebody's
been hired a while and been promoted.

31
00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.268
So let's only look at how people
entered their current job.

32
00:01:44.268 --> 00:01:48.160
Another big issue is you've got
a lot of different jobs here, okay?

33
00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.578
So if I just take everybody
who's been hired, and

34
00:01:50.578 --> 00:01:53.067
everybody who's been promoted and
compare them.

35
00:01:53.067 --> 00:01:56.551
Well that's really going to be conflated
with the fact that some jobs are likely to

36
00:01:56.551 --> 00:01:58.850
hire more and
other jobs are likely to promote more.

37
00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.647
And so really I wanted to
use very detailed controls,

38
00:02:01.647 --> 00:02:04.643
talked a bit about this in
multi-variable regression.

39
00:02:04.643 --> 00:02:06.840
You kind of strip out
those job-level effects.

40
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.920
And so I could conceptually think about
comparing people in the same job.

41
00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.870
What are their outcomes based on how they
entered the job, and kind of equivalent

42
00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.280
to that, I also wanted to only have jobs
that could be entered in multiple ways.

43
00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.350
And so, two things I wanted to do.

44
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.300
So, first of all,

45
00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.870
let's drop all the lower level jobs
that you can't enter by promotion.

46
00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.836
And in addition, I also wanted to drop
anybody who I didn't see entering the job.

47
00:02:32.836 --> 00:02:37.359
Also one of the big concerns is
people particularly over time their

48
00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:38.983
performance changes.

49
00:02:38.983 --> 00:02:42.210
And so I only wanted people I knew
when they entered that job and

50
00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:43.647
how they entered that job.

51
00:02:43.647 --> 00:02:47.910
So kind of clean the data set first and
then look at these relationships.

52
00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.330
In this case I saw quite a lot going on.

53
00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.660
So first off I saw
differences in performance.

54
00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.800
So the people who are hired into the job
perform much worse than the people

55
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.590
who are promoted for
about the first two to three years.

56
00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.660
Much more likely to get poor ratings, much
less likely to get the highest ratings.

57
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.230
You saw over time their
performance converges.

58
00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.580
And so it's not necessarily
they are hiring worse people.

59
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.712
But it kind of really said something about
how long it's taking people to get up

60
00:03:19.712 --> 00:03:21.414
to speed in this organization.

61
00:03:21.414 --> 00:03:25.430
Then you can't just transition and
get off to a running start, okay?

62
00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.330
People need to learn even
when we're coming and

63
00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.620
high levels require experience from us.

64
00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.660
The other piece of it that I
saw that was quite interesting.

65
00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.198
So even though there
are performance differences,

66
00:03:35.198 --> 00:03:37.627
people who were hired were
performing less well.

67
00:03:37.627 --> 00:03:42.770
It was also the case that people who
are hired were getting paid more, okay?

68
00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:44.250
So we're paying people a lot more, and

69
00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.890
being able to perform worse doesn't sound
like a good deal for the organization.

70
00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.561
And these were differences that were
actually much more persistent than

71
00:03:50.561 --> 00:03:51.753
the performance differences.

72
00:03:51.753 --> 00:03:54.925
And we can dig into that, it's possible
to see that a lot of that has to do with

73
00:03:54.925 --> 00:03:56.614
the differences in who you're hiring,

74
00:03:56.614 --> 00:03:59.910
when you hire from outside you don't
know much about people's performance.

75
00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.871
You tend to want to make sure
you have a good resume and

76
00:04:01.871 --> 00:04:06.050
so these people coming in from
outside then have more education,

77
00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:09.920
more experience as an employer,
you have to pay more for that.

78
00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.310
So I certainly thought this
is a fun study to do but

79
00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.060
I think it has some practical
implications right?

80
00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.240
If I was in an organization
I want to know this, why?

81
00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:21.720
First, okay, maybe we should think more
seriously about our internal development.

82
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.550
On the margin,
hiring looks quite expensive.

83
00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.190
The second thing that it really tells
me is wow, it's taken a long time for

84
00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.310
our hires to get up to speed, so
what are we doing about onboarding?

85
00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.650
How do we help accelerate
that process of learning?

86
00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:36.930
That's something we want to put in place,
and

87
00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.450
maybe that's something we
also want to assess, seek on

88
00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:43.090
all these performance ratings, converging
more rapidly once we've done that.

89
00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.140
So this kind of evaluation of
staffing options can tell you a lot.

90
00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:50.625
We have another example of doing
this kind of work which was done by

91
00:04:50.625 --> 00:04:52.290
JR Keller who's at Cornell.

92
00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.130
He did this when he was a PhD student
at Wharton, we're very proud of him.

93
00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.360
He looked at another difference in
the way that companies staff jobs.

94
00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.360
Obviously, a lot of people
move jobs inside firms.

95
00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.780
Well they do so
often in two very different ways.

96
00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:09.970
And so kind of a stereotype is this idea
that kind of your manager walks in one day

97
00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.580
and says congratulations
you've been promoted.

98
00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:17.380
That happens a lot but the other thing
that can happen is that jobs are posted.

99
00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:21.810
So somebody puts together a formal job
description, they stick on a website,

100
00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:25.580
maybe they put it up on bulletin boards
and say we need somebody to fill this job.

101
00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.380
If you're in the organization
you very welcome to apply and

102
00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.550
then we'll go through and
we'll see who does best.

103
00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.190
The organization is looking at,
they did a lot of filling jobs both ways.

104
00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:37.330
In fact, I think most organizations
now use both these mechanisms.

105
00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.610
Well, from the HR department
I'm kind of curious which

106
00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:42.500
of these should I be encouraging?

107
00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.350
Which tends to work better?

108
00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:47.890
And so he looked at all of the outcomes of
people entering their jobs through these

109
00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:49.870
to see are there differences.

110
00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:50.990
And he found they really were.

111
00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:57.240
So what he found in particular were some
real advantages of internal posting.

112
00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.140
First of all, it enables people
to do more unusual things.

113
00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:03.290
And so the career paths that most people
made through internal posting were more

114
00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:05.430
unusual, which kind of makes sense.

115
00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:08.630
It's people from throughout
the organization saying I'm not clear on

116
00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:09.700
what I'm to be doing now.

117
00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:12.030
That looks more interesting,
let's go try that.

118
00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:17.600
What's more intriguing was that he also
found that performance was systematically

119
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:22.430
higher after people had
moved jobs through posting

120
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:26.370
versus the manager just
sponsoring them for a job.

121
00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:31.090
One reason for that, potentially, is we're
looking at a wider pool of applicants.

122
00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:35.310
And so we're taking the best
person from a much greater pool,

123
00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:38.080
people who we wouldn't necessarily
have thought of for the job, but

124
00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:39.830
are interested and
turn out to be very good at it.

125
00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:42.226
And certainly,
we see this kind of way to pool.

126
00:06:42.226 --> 00:06:46.259
But the other thing that was really
interesting was that people who had been

127
00:06:46.259 --> 00:06:47.805
in the same group all along.

128
00:06:47.805 --> 00:06:52.580
And got promoted into a job through
posting also performed higher than if

129
00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:56.920
they'd been promoted into the job
through sponsorship,okay?

130
00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:58.870
So, it's not just about
getting a richer pool, and

131
00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:03.130
I think the story that seems most
plausible here kind of back to hiring.

132
00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:06.320
So I talked there about kind of more
structured process doing better.

133
00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:09.150
So kind of posting some more
structured processes as well.

134
00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:11.324
And what we think's going
on is the managers,

135
00:07:11.324 --> 00:07:14.336
when they're forced to think about it,
when they know they're

136
00:07:14.336 --> 00:07:18.690
going to have to justify that decision
to the people that they didn't promote.

137
00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:21.640
Take a more structured decision making
approach and probably do it better.

138
00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:26.060
The same time we saw some
things were good for workers or

139
00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:28.440
bad for the organization,
depending upon your perspective.

140
00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:31.960
We also so paved change depending
on how people entered the job.

141
00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:34.340
Looked holding everything else constant,
but

142
00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:39.940
when people moved jobs by posting,
they got more of a pay raise.

143
00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:43.090
We think that has a lot to do with
negotiations inside the firm.

144
00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:44.850
When you've established
you're the best candidate,

145
00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:46.800
you have a stronger negotiating position.

146
00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.670
When you've been forced to
apply through a market,

147
00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:52.280
you may also feel more empowered to
actually go out and ask for more money.

148
00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:56.100
And so we see yet
again how people are staffed matters.

149
00:07:56.100 --> 00:08:00.020
And the value of within your organization
trying to get a handle on which of

150
00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:04.080
the processes are better, which should we
be encouraging, and which shouldn't we.

151
00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:09.440
Of course when we think about making those
decisions one of the things we worry about

152
00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:12.308
a lot is what's really
driving these relationships.

153
00:08:12.308 --> 00:08:15.930
Does this mean that if we do more
posting we'll see better performance.

154
00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:19.360
And that gets in to issues of causality
and I want to spend a few minutes in

155
00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:24.440
the next segment just talking about
how we think about causality and

156
00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:25.680
where we need to worry about it.
