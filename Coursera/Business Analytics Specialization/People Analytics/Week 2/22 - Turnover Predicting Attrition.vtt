1
00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.460
So given the sort of understanding
of why people leave jobs.

2
00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.948
What organizations then want to
do is go and start looking back.

3
00:00:07.948 --> 00:00:09.748
Okay, who's leaving?

4
00:00:09.748 --> 00:00:11.187
And where are they leaving from?

5
00:00:11.187 --> 00:00:15.560
And how can we use this to help us think
about what we want to do about it?

6
00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.160
And so the first thing the organizations
often end up looking is just kind of

7
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.420
where they are leaving from.

8
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.199
When the big questions is managers.

9
00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:27.285
Do we see the attrition as
associated with different managers?

10
00:00:27.285 --> 00:00:30.400
And as we saw right in the beginning,
spoiler alert.

11
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.550
Yes.
Kind of every organization that does this,

12
00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.775
the big insight they come back with this.

13
00:00:35.775 --> 00:00:39.490
Wow there's huge difference
across our managers in terms of

14
00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:40.240
their rate of attrition.

15
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.390
Now obviously there's going to be
some sort of natural variation.

16
00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.050
I think Kade is talking with you

17
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.570
about the fact that in any data set you're
just going to see random variation.

18
00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.169
There's a point at which you don't
want to read too much into it.

19
00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.310
If you look at it, you will see that there
are some managers who are often real

20
00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.760
outliers, to the extent to which you
think this is more than random variation.

21
00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.460
And that does tell you
something about where to start

22
00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:04.670
dealing with your attrition problem.

23
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.127
You also as I say, want to think
about how we're hiring people.

24
00:01:09.127 --> 00:01:13.326
Are there people that we're hiring
who are particularly likely to leave?

25
00:01:13.326 --> 00:01:16.506
And do we want that to inform our
hiring processors to whether or

26
00:01:16.506 --> 00:01:19.900
not we want to look for
slightly different attributes?

27
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.430
Obviously, we want to
understand all their functions,

28
00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.730
types of work, types of projects that
are really leading to attrition.

29
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.500
What can we do to lessen their demands?

30
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:30.122
And so on.

31
00:01:30.122 --> 00:01:34.360
Is it our high performers,
is it our low performers that leave?

32
00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.530
And there's also geography.

33
00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:42.430
Is it the fact that, for example, commute
distances can be a big driver of time?

34
00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.710
While I'm on that subject,
one of the interesting and

35
00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.660
challenging issues of people analytics
is worrying about adverse impact.

36
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.133
And so, suddenly within the US and
I think many jurisdictions,

37
00:01:55.133 --> 00:01:58.790
there are important regulations
about discrimination.

38
00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:04.617
In the US those regulations are not just
about deliberate discrimination by race,

39
00:02:04.617 --> 00:02:06.792
ethnicity, gender and so on.

40
00:02:06.792 --> 00:02:11.251
But they're also about putting in place
procedures that have the affect of

41
00:02:11.251 --> 00:02:14.870
disproportionately screening
out certain groups.

42
00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.417
Also, as you think about do we
want to favor people within a certain

43
00:02:17.417 --> 00:02:18.308
commuting distance.

44
00:02:18.308 --> 00:02:21.853
You want to be worried about what
does this mean about kind of are we

45
00:02:21.853 --> 00:02:22.825
segregating it.

46
00:02:22.825 --> 00:02:26.130
Are there certain races that this is
going to make life more difficult for?

47
00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.120
And indeed I would say throughout doing
people analytics on a practical level.

48
00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.040
At a certain point you probably want to
just chat with a lawyer to think about

49
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.100
where might you get into trouble
implementing some of these things, and

50
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.970
where might you.

51
00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:40.520
That aside,

52
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.920
there are still all sorts of exciting
things you can do in predicting attrition.

53
00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.276
Now there are some organizations these
days that look at social network behavior.

54
00:02:48.276 --> 00:02:48.784
And so,

55
00:02:48.784 --> 00:02:53.968
there's a belief when somebody suddenly
starts updating their LinkedIn profile.

56
00:02:53.968 --> 00:02:59.150
That's often a sign that they're
thinking about other opportunities.

57
00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.178
Is that a point at which
you want to intervene?

58
00:03:01.178 --> 00:03:02.350
And so, yeah.

59
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.930
All sorts of fun things you can
do if you're creative to try and

60
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.020
understand who's likely to leave and
how we can intervene.

61
00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.250
In terms of doing this analysis.

62
00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.128
Again, there are a variety of
different things that you can do.

63
00:03:15.128 --> 00:03:18.504
And at the lowest level is
take on different groups and

64
00:03:18.504 --> 00:03:23.166
types of workers and calculate what
percentage of them leave every year.

65
00:03:23.166 --> 00:03:26.440
These kind of standard attrition
statistics that you see,

66
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.560
percent turn over.

67
00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.540
Okay, and again, I'd definitely
encourage you to do tests for

68
00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.700
statistical significance to
understand which of these differences

69
00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.310
are meaningful and which are not.

70
00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:41.540
I think a big concern with these
straight attrition percentages

71
00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.950
is they really don't take into account
the fact that people are much more likely

72
00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.890
to leave early in their tenure.

73
00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.260
As you can certainly
imagine certain groups, for

74
00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.930
some reason a couple of people leave.

75
00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.000
They're then going to fill
these with new workers.

76
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.920
Those new workers are themselves
much more likely to leave.

77
00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.470
And so, it may end up looking like you
have a big attrition problem in one group.

78
00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.690
Just because on average,
workers tend to have been there less time.

79
00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.670
A better approach is actually to
look at this on a cohort basis.

80
00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.170
So produce statistics saying okay, what
proportion of people last three months,

81
00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.240
last six months, last a year, and so on.

82
00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:20.178
And compare those across groups and
managers.

83
00:04:20.178 --> 00:04:22.384
And so on.

84
00:04:22.384 --> 00:04:27.570
Even better, kind of the same sort of
approach that we talked about before with

85
00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:32.758
predicting performance is to think about
what are all of the various different

86
00:04:32.758 --> 00:04:37.807
processes, or all the different
predictors that might affect attrition.

87
00:04:37.807 --> 00:04:40.360
And throw them into
a multivariate regression,

88
00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.320
where you're trying to predict things like
who stays six months, who stays a year.

89
00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.390
So multivariate structure helps
enable you start untangling those.

90
00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:49.410
Is it age?

91
00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:50.650
Is it education?

92
00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.730
Is it experience level?

93
00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:56.660
And so on, and see kind of what
seems to have the strongest effect

94
00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.650
on who stays and who leaves.

95
00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:03.730
Even better than this, if you're
kind of doing this professionally.

96
00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:07.940
Is to use a slightly different class
of models called survival models

97
00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.210
to really help you
understand what's going on.

98
00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.317
I just want to spend a minute or
two talking about what those are.

99
00:05:14.317 --> 00:05:18.313
So survival analysis take the name I think
in part from the fact that they're used

100
00:05:18.313 --> 00:05:19.677
heavily in epidemiology.

101
00:05:19.677 --> 00:05:23.647
Where your question is
the worst case scenario.

102
00:05:23.647 --> 00:05:25.307
We assign a treatment to somebody.

103
00:05:25.307 --> 00:05:27.142
How long does it take them to die?

104
00:05:27.142 --> 00:05:28.108
And who survives?

105
00:05:28.108 --> 00:05:29.610
And for how long?

106
00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.650
So, what you see is something like
the curve that I've got on the slide.

107
00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.070
Where over time,

108
00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:38.220
you want to understand what proportion
of the sample stay at the firm.

109
00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:42.440
And you're probably going to see
something like an exponential decay.

110
00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.850
Where so say, people earlier on the job
decide whether they like it or not.

111
00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:47.824
They're more likely to leave early.

112
00:05:47.824 --> 00:05:53.070
And then the longer they stay,
the more likely they are to remain there.

113
00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:55.020
So turnover drops over time.

114
00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:00.530
So what survival analysis do is they first
try and fit this kind of time function.

115
00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:03.270
So we can see over kind a range
of people who've been there for

116
00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:04.570
different amounts of time.

117
00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:08.052
Basically, what's the likelihood
of their leaving?

118
00:06:08.052 --> 00:06:09.970
And how does that change?

119
00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:11.511
And then they say, okay.

120
00:06:11.511 --> 00:06:16.107
And now how the various factors
shift that kind of curve.

121
00:06:16.107 --> 00:06:20.920
And so we could imagine some
sort of variable, I don't know.

122
00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:24.634
Let's say,
experience level at the point of hiring,

123
00:06:24.634 --> 00:06:28.430
which makes them either more,
or less likely to stay.

124
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:32.330
So in this case, if it reduces
the general propensity to leave.

125
00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.870
What this does is it shifts
the curve up with it.

126
00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:39.370
And so every point in time people
more likely to still be at the firm.

127
00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:43.010
The nice thing about this kind of
analysis is that you're not just looking

128
00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:46.090
three months, six months,
one year chunk separately.

129
00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:47.870
We look at them all together.

130
00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:50.810
Account for
that kind of time dependence of turn over.

131
00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:54.460
And then say, what are the characteristics
of individuals, the groups they're in,

132
00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:55.112
the managers.

133
00:06:55.112 --> 00:06:56.971
All those things that
we talked about before.

134
00:06:56.971 --> 00:07:01.822
Which of them ultimately make it
more likely that people are going

135
00:07:01.822 --> 00:07:03.594
to leave at some point?

136
00:07:03.594 --> 00:07:07.738
And so what I've tried to emphasize over
the course of this module is the different

137
00:07:07.738 --> 00:07:11.461
ways in which bringing data to the
question could inform how we make some of

138
00:07:11.461 --> 00:07:13.586
the most important staffing decisions.

139
00:07:13.586 --> 00:07:16.693
That not only shape how people
perform in their jobs, but

140
00:07:16.693 --> 00:07:18.320
shape their careers as well.

141
00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:21.620
Ever since there've been organizations,

142
00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:26.290
we've been doing this based on instinct,
hunch, and so on.

143
00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:31.020
Now that we have so much data about what
people are doing, strong analytical tools.

144
00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:34.780
There really is the opportunity to
bring more rigor to the process.

145
00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:36.240
Make it more data driven.

146
00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:39.490
And certainly all of the early
evidence suggested doing so

147
00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:42.310
improves the quality of
decisions that we make.

148
00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:45.180
Helping us get the right
people into the right jobs.

149
00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:46.690
And helping them stay there.

150
00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:49.400
In ways that again,
are going to help the organizations.

151
00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:52.160
And also going to make for
better careers for the people within them.
