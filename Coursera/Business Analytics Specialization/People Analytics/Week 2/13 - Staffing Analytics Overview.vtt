Hello, in this module I'm going to talk
about staffing, getting people into jobs.

2
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.700
So clearly managing people is hugely
complex, there is a lot that goes into it,

3
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.070
certainly enough to keep.

4
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.120
Human resource managers,

5
00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:22.500
millions of human resource manages busy
and thousands of academic studying them.

6
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.310
That said,

7
00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.960
I think that really the most fundamental
part of managing people is staffing.

8
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.850
Cuz ultimately, if you get that right,

9
00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:34.060
if you get the right people into the jobs,
then you're gonna have to spend a lot

10
00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.120
less time worrying about many of the other
things like performance management.

11
00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.200
Arguably if you don't do any staffing at
all, also your people problems are simpler

12
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.000
but that's probably not the right route
for most organizations to go down.

13
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.490
In terms of what we
talk about in staffing,

14
00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:51.410
I wanna talk about three
different aspects.

15
00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.190
So the first is hiring, making sure
we have the right people in the job.

16
00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.910
Then when you got them in the organization
you also want to think about are they in

17
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.870
the right job and how do we move people
up in through different jobs overtime.

18
00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.940
And then the final piece can be
opposite of hiring is attrition.

19
00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.810
One of the things in staffing we care
a lot about is how do we make sure

20
00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.010
that people stay in their jobs and
we're not having to move them.

21
00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.670
So particularly, I think, as organizations
start doing people analytics

22
00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.460
some of the first things they end up
looking at are the staffing questions.

23
00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.760
Particularly, are we
hiring the right people?

24
00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.250
And whose leaving and
how do we stop that from happening?

25
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.750
What I want to do around these
topics within this module is really

26
00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.370
three things, okay.

27
00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:38.370
So first I want to talk about some basic
facts around the staffing processes,

28
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:43.470
so, how does hiring work, what do we
know tends to be better with hiring?

29
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.090
Then I really want to delve into,

30
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.830
what's the value of doing
analytics within an organization?

31
00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.030
How can we add to this by actually
starting to look at the facts and

32
00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.100
figures about what we're
doing in our own company?

33
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.340
And then I want to move a little bit
deeper and say, what are some of

34
00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.930
the techniques that people can use,
kind of what works, what's best practice?

35
00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.210
And so that's the general outcome.
