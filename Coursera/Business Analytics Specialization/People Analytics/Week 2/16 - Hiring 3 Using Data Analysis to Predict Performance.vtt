1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.856
So how the people actually go
about addressing these issues?

2
00:00:03.856 --> 00:00:07.705
So [COUGH] there variety of different
things that you can do kind

3
00:00:07.705 --> 00:00:12.850
of the simplest is just to take your
best and worst performances in the job.

4
00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.070
And compare them on a variety
of characteristics to see which

5
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.600
characteristics are best
predict performance.

6
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.200
As you do that, one of the things
I do think you wanna do is

7
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.180
what we call test
the statistical significance.

8
00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.408
Again, please think about taking a course,
an introductory course in statistics.

9
00:00:30.408 --> 00:00:33.820
These tests for statistical significance
are basically trying to see,

10
00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.970
you know, is this a big difference or

11
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.750
could this just be explained by the fact
there's random variation in any data.

12
00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.460
So there's kind of the very basic.

13
00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.740
I think better than that is to try and

14
00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.950
be a bit more systematic
about who you compare.

15
00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.350
So, for example, like I said, we expect
the time somebody has been in the job to

16
00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.970
have a big effect on their performance.

17
00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.210
So you want to compare people who've had
similar amounts of time in the job and

18
00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.090
look at what characteristics
shape who's a better and

19
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.710
worse performer within that cohort.

20
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.920
Also try and just look at people
who are on the same job together.

21
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.290
Even better than that, and I think what
most organizations would look to do will

22
00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.180
be what we call multivariate regressions.

23
00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.010
I'm not sure how many of you
know much about this, so

24
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.940
I'm just gonna give a very
brief conceptual introduction.

25
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.080
It's something you can't
actually do in Excel.

26
00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.920
If you Google it there bunch for
other statistical packages.

27
00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.930
It's very useful for this kinds of.

28
00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.811
So the basic idea of what it's doing is,

29
00:01:35.811 --> 00:01:40.147
if you plot out your data set,
so, plot out,

30
00:01:40.147 --> 00:01:46.740
see here y would be performance,
x could be for example GPA.

31
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.680
And so each dot is a person right, and

32
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.320
you've got on the one hand their GPA,
on the other hand their performance.

33
00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.130
And you get the kind of
the scatter plot like this.

34
00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.170
And you want to understand,
is there a relationship,

35
00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.310
how much does a higher GPA
actually predict performance?

36
00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.700
Conceptually, what multivariate
regression is doing

37
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.990
is it's just finding the best
fit line through this data.

38
00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.930
The line that you would draw that
really summarizes this relationship.

39
00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.740
And it has three very nice
characteristics for doing this work.

40
00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.431
Okay the first is usually it
doesn't do this graphically, but

41
00:02:22.431 --> 00:02:24.886
it spits out an equation that
looks something like this.

42
00:02:24.886 --> 00:02:28.483
So here maybe performance
is 3.2 on average,

43
00:02:28.483 --> 00:02:31.530
plus .2 times whatever the GPA is.

44
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.090
So it gives you a way to quantify
the effect of this variable.

45
00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.090
The second thing that's nice about this is

46
00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.980
that it also tells you the level
of statistical significance.

47
00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.330
So is this really just a gap, if we throw
a bunch of dots at a piece of paper,

48
00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.410
we're gonna be able to
draw some line through it.

49
00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.071
You know, is that what's going on here or

50
00:02:50.071 --> 00:02:52.263
does there really look like
there's a relationship?

51
00:02:52.263 --> 00:02:56.075
The third reason the multivariate
regression is useful,

52
00:02:56.075 --> 00:03:01.560
particularly in this context, is you can
have multiple different x-variables.

53
00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.470
So, I'm not going to try and

54
00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.120
draw what this would look like
in multidimensional space.

55
00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.320
I really don't have that artistic talent.

56
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.400
But you could imagine,
you know you don't just have GPA.

57
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.760
Maybe you have their level of related
work experience, and maybe you have

58
00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.770
how well they rated on a job knowledge
test, and various other things.

59
00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:22.500
And you want to try and

60
00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.440
disentangle how each of these
variables shapes performance.

61
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.727
That's what the regression will do, will
kind of draw this best-fit line through

62
00:03:31.727 --> 00:03:37.166
this multidimensional space, and you'll
end with something that looks like this,

63
00:03:37.166 --> 00:03:40.129
where it tells you okay,
has an effect on GPA.

64
00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:43.447
So GPA affects performance, in addition so

65
00:03:43.447 --> 00:03:47.130
does experience and so
does the job launch test.

66
00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.990
And this is how much.

67
00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.500
And so

68
00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.670
it's that ability to untangle multiple
different things we know about people.

69
00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.360
Figure out which of those have
the strongest effect on performance and

70
00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.480
which of them doesn't
really matter very much.

71
00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:00.967
Where regression is really very strong.

72
00:04:00.967 --> 00:04:04.324
And so I think that's probably the way
that most people if they had the time

73
00:04:04.324 --> 00:04:05.580
would go about doing this.

74
00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.630
Probably best practice would be also to
try and think a little bit about this

75
00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:16.140
selection process that we're not looking
at what this relationship looks like in

76
00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:20.760
all of the people that applied, but only
the ones that we actually try to hire.

77
00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.740
This is quite challenging cuz obviously
you don't have the performance data

78
00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.088
on all of the people that you didn't hire.

79
00:04:26.088 --> 00:04:30.260
There are various statistical techniques
for actually correcting the sample, so

80
00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:31.390
you can correct for that.

81
00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:34.540
You can also potentially correct for
the fact that not everybody stays, and so

82
00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:35.740
the sample of people for

83
00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.300
whom you have this data is also selected
on the other side by who's left.

84
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.340
So there are things like Heckman selection
corrections that do this for you.

85
00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:44.410
They're quite sophisticated.

86
00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.770
You want to take your advanced
statistics course for that, and

87
00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.920
they also have a number of problems in
terms of they're kind of quite sensitive

88
00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.810
to some of the statistical properties.

89
00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.247
So most cases I think people will
stick with multivariate regression.

90
00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.430
I think a question that a lot of people
are interested in as they do this is,

91
00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:05.260
okay so we're kind of thinking we're gonna
use an algorithm to give us a sense of

92
00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.900
who to hire.

93
00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.870
Really, we're gonna let
a computer tell us?

94
00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.170
Surely, we should have
a better sense of this.

95
00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.020
How good are these algorithms?

96
00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.850
So, there's some bad news here.

97
00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:24.450
So, the bad news is these algorithms
are very far from perfect.

98
00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:28.355
The combination of various
effective means, work samples,

99
00:05:28.355 --> 00:05:33.760
cognitive ability tests, all these
sorts of things, most cases probably

100
00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:38.840
don't predict more than about 30 or
40% of the variation in performance.

101
00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.870
So we're not that good
at really identifying

102
00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:44.160
who's gonna be your best performer.

103
00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.170
That's the bad news.

104
00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:49.630
The worse news is that they're
probably still better than people are.

105
00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:55.240
There was a very nice study done by Mitch
Hoffman at the University of Toronto and

106
00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:00.260
some colleagues where he looked at
data on hiring into call centers.

107
00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.060
So I mentioned earlier attrition is
often one of the things that you're

108
00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:03.970
worried about.

109
00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:08.637
You're really worried about that in a call
center because most of these call center

110
00:06:08.637 --> 00:06:10.303
will take one, two, three,

111
00:06:10.303 --> 00:06:14.253
four weeks to train people before
they ever let them answer the phone.

112
00:06:14.253 --> 00:06:18.005
And then turnover is very high, a lot of
people leave after three, six months,

113
00:06:18.005 --> 00:06:20.420
something like that, and
so it's hugely costly.

114
00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:24.435
And so being able to drive down
turnover is a big influence on cost, so

115
00:06:24.435 --> 00:06:27.705
it's one of the things they
really screen for heavily.

116
00:06:27.705 --> 00:06:32.448
There are a number of vendors
that help them with this, and so

117
00:06:32.448 --> 00:06:37.285
Mitch had data that looked at
how these performance screens,

118
00:06:37.285 --> 00:06:39.254
which are algorithmic.

119
00:06:39.254 --> 00:06:41.787
We give you a bunch of tests and
then we spit out a score,

120
00:06:41.787 --> 00:06:43.810
how they did with predicting turnover.

121
00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:46.920
And so in particular what these screens
do is they just advise the manager,

122
00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:49.490
they say this person is a good risk.

123
00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:51.270
This person's a poor risk.

124
00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:52.645
We found a couple of things.

125
00:06:52.645 --> 00:06:55.860
Firstly, when companies adopted
these screening techniques,

126
00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.662
then their turn over dropped.

127
00:06:58.662 --> 00:07:02.650
So when managers had more information
on who is likely to turn over,

128
00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:07.880
they did better in terms of hiring
in terms of having lower turn over.

129
00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:11.970
The thing that was more frightening
was that managers also had discretion.

130
00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:14.730
So they got this advice but
they didn't have to follow it.

131
00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:19.910
But what Mitch found was that when
they used their discretion more,

132
00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:23.900
turnover was higher, and so I think
the most obvious interpretation of this

133
00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:26.320
is algorithms are not great but
they're still better than we are.

134
00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:30.637
You know we get back to Daniel Kahneman
carrying his log around, right?

135
00:07:30.637 --> 00:07:36.990
The idea is that algorithms
are not perfect, we're worse.

136
00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:40.380
And so there's huge potential in
this space for data analytics and

137
00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:43.000
people analytics to improve
how we go about hiring.
