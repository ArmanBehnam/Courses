1
00:00:04.479 --> 00:00:07.880
The next challenge we're going to
consider is self-fulfilling prophecies.

2
00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.870
There are a couple challenges
here mixed together,

3
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.750
but the umbrella idea is
self-fulfilling prophecies.

4
00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:19.030
And I want to motivate it by reminding you
of a movie from 1983, a well-known movie

5
00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:23.890
starring Eddie Murphy as
originally a fraud and

6
00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.740
a beggar and a ne'er do well.

7
00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:32.950
And Dan Aykroyd as a successful
pedigreed investment banker.

8
00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:34.670
And if you've seen the movie
you know what happens.

9
00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:40.120
But basically Aykroyd's
character's uncle's have a bet

10
00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.810
that they could, if they wanted, turn
the Murphy character into essentially,

11
00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.160
the Aykroyd character, and vice versa.

12
00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.790
That if they simply treat the Murphy
character different, they could elevate

13
00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:56.160
him from the streets of New York into
a well healed investment banker.

14
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.680
And conversely, if they treated
Dan Aykroyd's character differently.

15
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.050
They would turn him in,
given a little time,

16
00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.610
to someone essentially as pitiful
as the Eddie Murphy character.

17
00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.680
If you've seen the movie you know that
they pulled this off quite successfully

18
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.460
for a while.

19
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.970
And that's the main point here is that
we have a profound impact on those who

20
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:23.190
we work around and who work for
us by what we expect of them.

21
00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.740
And what the psychologists
have documented over time

22
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.850
is that people respond
to those expectations.

23
00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.710
That people tend toward performing
consistent with expectations.

24
00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.950
High expectations increase performance.

25
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.290
Low expectations decrease performance.

26
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.570
This occurs for one of two main reasons.

27
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.900
One is that we tend to
treat people differently

28
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.760
when we have high expectations for
them or low expectations.

29
00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.350
So we might actually put them
in different situations,

30
00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.560
not unlike Dan Aykroyd's character's
Uncles' did in Trading Places.

31
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.722
So this has been studied in teachers
in classrooms where they manipulate

32
00:01:57.722 --> 00:02:03.392
teachers expectations for children and
they observe that even though children

33
00:02:03.392 --> 00:02:08.571
were randomly assigned here that
over time their performance changes.

34
00:02:08.571 --> 00:02:12.294
And they track the mechanism to that
teachers treat them differently,

35
00:02:12.294 --> 00:02:16.202
teachers treat, they give more attention
to those they expect more from,

36
00:02:16.202 --> 00:02:18.824
they give less attention
those expect less from.

37
00:02:18.824 --> 00:02:23.484
They put in short those they have high
expectations for and advantage situations

38
00:02:23.484 --> 00:02:27.130
and the students respond to that and
perform better over time.

39
00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:33.650
Another mechanism by which self fulfilling
prophecies work is that merely having our

40
00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.330
expectations voiced can change
the other party's behavior.

41
00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.860
So I want to give you
an example from the literature.

42
00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.850
A famous example from Snyder et
al in 1977 on stereotypes and

43
00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.720
how they exercise influence.

44
00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.030
Even if we're not changing
the situation that the person is in.

45
00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.260
So this was an experimental procedure and
the cover for

46
00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.060
this, the cover story meaning what
the experimenters told the participants.

47
00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.630
They were studying initial interactions
that don't include non-verbal.

48
00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.960
So they wanted to study
telephone conversations.

49
00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.140
Because they wanted to kind of control for
nonverbal's.

50
00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.150
They created anonymous male/female
pairings in the first stage.

51
00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.210
In the second stage they put these
pairs into a telephone conversation and

52
00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:22.390
they recorded both sides of the telephone
conversation and they recorded them

53
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.270
separately so people can hear just
one side of that if they want to.

54
00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.350
The researchers can have
coders hear just one side.

55
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.910
But the people involved in the study
are literally talking to each other

56
00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:33.530
on the telephone.

57
00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.020
Each party's side of the conversation was
evaluated by these independent judges.

58
00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.370
The judges were unaware of
the hypotheses and the manipulations.

59
00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.170
Here's the manipulation,
it's an interesting one, and

60
00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.980
it's a little bit sexist but
that's okay because this has been studied

61
00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.670
with reversing the roles and
it still goes through.

62
00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.930
But at the time what they did was
they distributed a photo of a female,

63
00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.480
supposedly the people in the study.

64
00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.140
In fact,
it wasn't the people in the study,

65
00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.940
these were photos taken from
a different university all together.

66
00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.700
And they had created these photos to be
one of two types, either of attractive,

67
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.460
relatively attractive females,
as rated by other parties, and

68
00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:12.270
relatively unattractive females.

69
00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:16.767
So essentially the males in the subject,
half the males are given

70
00:04:16.767 --> 00:04:21.453
an attractive photo and
told that that's who they're talking to.

71
00:04:21.453 --> 00:04:24.845
The other half of the men in the study
were given an unattractive photo and

72
00:04:24.845 --> 00:04:27.810
again told that that is
the person they were talking to.

73
00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.710
This is the experimental manipulation,
so you can see what they're doing.

74
00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.750
They're changing the expectations
of the men in the study and

75
00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:40.100
what they're going to do is find out how
does that change how the women behave.

76
00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.690
So there were no photos
on the female side,

77
00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.760
they didn't know that they're
were photos distributed.

78
00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.650
All they knew is that they were in this
study that was supposed to be about

79
00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:49.210
interaction.

80
00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.570
The initial interactions
that don't have non verbals.

81
00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.730
So here's a diagram of what this
looks like just to be clear.

82
00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:58.720
They take the men in the study and

83
00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.660
they randomly assign them to one
of two conditions, M1 and M2.

84
00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.640
M1 being those who received
attractive female photos.

85
00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.370
Again, these aren't the photos
of the actual people.

86
00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.510
These are separate people altogether.

87
00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:10.640
And half received unattractive photos.

88
00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:15.230
Women are again randomly assigned to F1 or
F2, no photos involved.

89
00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:17.190
And then they have a phone call.

90
00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:22.490
They then allow people to ask the judges
to go listen these phone calls.

91
00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:26.190
They listen to just one side and
evaluate what happens.

92
00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:31.580
So what they find is that men
in the M1 group, the group

93
00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:36.350
that had received the attractive female
photos, treated the women friendlier.

94
00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:40.190
They literally even though the judges
didn't know the hypothesis,

95
00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:41.820
they didn't even know
the difference in the groups.

96
00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:46.690
They rated the interactions
by the men as friendlier.

97
00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:52.637
It may not be too surprising but
what's surprising and a little profound is

98
00:05:52.637 --> 00:05:57.960
that the raters who were listening to the
female side of the conversation were asked

99
00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.640
to judge the attractiveness, the perceived
attractiveness of the woman on the phone.

100
00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:03.760
Again they're just listening
to them on the phone.

101
00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:07.497
But what they found was,
women in F1 were rated as more attractive

102
00:06:07.497 --> 00:06:11.380
than women in F2 only because
they were treated differently.

103
00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:14.880
So see what these researchers
have accomplished.

104
00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:18.380
They have manipulated the expectations
of the men in this study.

105
00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:21.490
As a result the men treat
the women differently.

106
00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:25.870
And the women then act in a way that
is consistent with those expectations,

107
00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:28.000
despite the fact that they didn't
even know what the expectations were.

108
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.020
They were completely
oblivious to what it was.

109
00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:36.400
So in this subtle situation they were able
to document this self-fulfilling prophecy.

110
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.660
This is the kind of thing that we worry
about a great deal in organizations.

111
00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.890
This is the kind of thing we worry about
a great deal in performance evaluation and

112
00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:47.770
talent analytics, what impact our
expectations have on employees.

113
00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:49.720
Because people are so hardwired this way.

114
00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:53.350
We're so hardwired to move in
the direction of the expectations people

115
00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:53.980
have for us.

116
00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:56.650
That's the psychologist take.

117
00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:00.070
The sociologist take steps
it up a notch yet and

118
00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:02.110
they had this notion
called The Matthew Effect.

119
00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:05.660
And The Matthew Effect comes from
sociologist Robert Merton in '68.

120
00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:11.110
It's coined from a passage
in the Gospel of Matthew.

121
00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:15.010
But the idea is that the rich get richer,
and the poor get poorer.

122
00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:19.330
And this comes from the accumulation
of early advantages.

123
00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:24.290
The idea is that those who are privileged
early in some way often then have

124
00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:29.230
a step ahead and then those advantages
grow exponentially over time.

125
00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:31.530
We see this in various studies.

126
00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:35.010
You can see it in consumer goods, some
very clever studies on consumer goods.

127
00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:36.680
You can see this in education.

128
00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:42.970
For example, students who are ahead in
reading early, then build on that and

129
00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:47.060
get further ahead in reading as you
go through their early education.

130
00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:51.090
And conversely, students who fall behind
early in their reading have a real

131
00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:54.290
hard time catching up, especially as
they get further and further behind.

132
00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:58.280
And so a little perturbation in
the beginning can accumulate over time.

133
00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:00.370
And we see the same thing with careers.

134
00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:04.200
The idea is that in any setting where
a little experience matters, or

135
00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:08.480
recognition matters, those with early
advantage will increasingly be privileged

136
00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:12.440
over time, that resources accumulate to
those who have these early advantages,

137
00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:15.280
even if those early advantages
might have been randomly assigned.

138
00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:20.150
So in general we have this issue
of self-fulfilling prophecies.

139
00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:21.670
It raises a few questions for us.

140
00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:25.360
It raises a few questions for
you in your organization and in your firm.

141
00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:29.980
Where might your expectations be
affecting other people's behaviors, or

142
00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:31.750
your evaluation of your behavior?

143
00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:35.480
Where are your expectations getting
kind of involved in this process.

144
00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:38.920
We want to find ways to pull your
expectations out of the process.

145
00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:41.850
So what specific steps can you take

146
00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:45.140
to protect the evaluation
processes from these expectations?

147
00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:49.080
Some firms, for example recognizing this,

148
00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:54.510
explicitly name these biases as they sit
down to begin the evaluation processes.

149
00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:55.430
They name it.

150
00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:59.960
They say, here are some biases we know,
in general, people are guilty of.

151
00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.180
Let's put them on the table.

152
00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:04.110
Let's be aware of them as we talk
through the next few hours, or

153
00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:06.160
whatever it's going to
be in their evaluations.

154
00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:10.440
And then finally, and this is more
along the lines of the sociologists,

155
00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:14.950
the Matthew Effect, how can you ensure
equal access to valuable resources?

156
00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:19.490
How can you ensure that those who don't
by chance, get an advantage early on,

157
00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:24.170
have that early advantage accumulate
resources that others aren't accumulating?

158
00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:26.610
What can you do to provide equal access?

159
00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:30.600
Otherwise, you're going to be drawing
inferences about skill, talent,

160
00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:33.290
effort based on resources
you see accumulated,

161
00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:36.320
even though it's not because of
underlying skill, talent, or effort,

162
00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:39.300
it's because of the Mathew effect or it's
because of self-fulfilling prophecies.
