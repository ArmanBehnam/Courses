1
00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.730
The next segment we want to
cover is interdependence.

2
00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:11.570
This is another challenge that you
face as you do your talent analytics.

3
00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.840
So much of our work depends on
the impact of other people.

4
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.830
We rarely get to evaluate
an employee in isolation.

5
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.390
Rarely is our work done in isolation.

6
00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.760
We are humbly dependent on other people,
so this poses a big challenge for

7
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.840
talent analytics where mostly
you're trying to infer

8
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.350
the quality of an individual despite the
fact that he or she works among a team.

9
00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.000
I had a conversation recently with
an executive who works with Google and

10
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.300
we were talking about exactly this
challenge, and she got really mad she says

11
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.300
it makes me so mad when people over
emphasize individual contributions.

12
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.440
Practically everything we
do is with other people.

13
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.630
If so and so left or so
and so left I'd quit.

14
00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.170
I couldn't do my job.

15
00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:58.070
She was really worked up.

16
00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.250
I was struck by how
quickly she got worked up.

17
00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.330
And this is a person who not
only performs very well,

18
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:08.220
but her job is to help people
make these evaluations better.

19
00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.800
And she appreciates, as well as
anybody I know, how difficult it is to

20
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.120
parse the individual contribution,
from the greater team impact.

21
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.530
So interdependence is an important
thing to keep your eye on

22
00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.290
as you try to make sense of the numbers.

23
00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.880
So, a great study by Boris Groysberg

24
00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.790
at Harvard from a few years
ago demonstrates this.

25
00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:33.110
He looked at investment analysts,
in particular rock-star

26
00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:38.960
investment analysts and their performance
as they moved from one firm to another.

27
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.220
So this is something that
happens in that industry.

28
00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.870
An individual will rise and gain
a reputation as having a particularly good

29
00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:51.180
bead on an industry or a set of
companies and build up some equity, and

30
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.500
then be poached by another organization,
and they move across organizations.

31
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.320
The nice thing about this
setting is that we can track

32
00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.670
analysts forecasts against what actually
happens and we can do this over years.

33
00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.720
And so we can evaluate how they
perform in one organization and

34
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.750
how they subsequently perform
in other organizations.

35
00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.710
So Groysberg goes in, saves a view years
of this,1988 through 1996 he looks at

36
00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:20.560
over a 1,000 star analysts and their
performance at 78 different investment

37
00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.260
banks, as they rose up in one, and
then moved or didn't move to another.

38
00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.170
He defines star as any analyst
who was ranked by the magazine

39
00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.920
Institutional Investor.

40
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.880
This magazine puts out annual
surveys on the best in the industry,

41
00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.510
best analyst in the industry.

42
00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.600
And everyone in the industry takes
these ratings very seriously and

43
00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.290
those who do well in these ratings
are recognized as star analysts and

44
00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.430
often those are exactly the ones who
get the offers to move to new firms.

45
00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:49.410
So Groysberg goes in and

46
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.200
finds out what happens when
these star analysts move firms?

47
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.280
This is what he found.

48
00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.820
He finds that performance plummets by
an average of 46% in the first year and

49
00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:03.490
even over five years it's about
20% below where they started.

50
00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:08.180
So on average, these guys not only
dip dramatically in the first year,

51
00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.770
which you might expect a little bit
of an adjustment cost, they never get

52
00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.340
back to their level that they were at
when they were at the original firm.

53
00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.500
So what happens here?

54
00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.070
Does the star lose intelligence?

55
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.250
Does the star forget the lessons
of their experience overnight, and

56
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.580
never get them back?

57
00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.350
It's unlikely, very unlikely
that this is what's going on.

58
00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.230
What goes on is,
they were part of a team before.

59
00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.640
They had researchers surrounding them,
all the institutional resources

60
00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.730
that were available to them and they
understood how to tap into, are gone now.

61
00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.670
And it's really tough to replicate that.

62
00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.150
Moreover, when we assess the ability and
the performance of that individual

63
00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.070
analyst, we think of it
as being the analyst.

64
00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.410
We don't consider the team
they're surrounded by.

65
00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.100
We don't consider the institution
they're embedded in.

66
00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.360
We think it's them, we pay them
a lot to come work for our firm, and

67
00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.240
then we find out they were only
one part of a broader machine.

68
00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.820
The impact, unfortunately, is broader than
just the income of that particular group.

69
00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.460
The impact affects the group
that brings them in.

70
00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:08.280
So from a head of research at one of
these firms, the research head says,

71
00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.870
I painfully learned that hiring a star
analyst resembles an organ transplant.

72
00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.550
First, the new body can reject
the prized organ that operated so

73
00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:15.950
well inside another body.

74
00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.620
On some occasions, the new organ hurts
healthy parts of the body by demanding

75
00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.600
a disproportionate blood supply other
parts of the body start to resent it,

76
00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.820
ache, and demand attention,
or threaten to stop working.

77
00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.070
You should think about it very
carefully before you do a transplant

78
00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:31.130
to a healthy body.

79
00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.300
You could get lucky, but success is rare.

80
00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.120
So this is an example from
the financial services industry,

81
00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:39.610
important example I believe.

82
00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.980
Stakes are high,
performance is quite observable.

83
00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:45.360
It's kind of a best case for
getting this right.

84
00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.040
And they don't seem to
be getting it right.

85
00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.350
We observe it in other countries.

86
00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:50.680
Lord knows we observe it
in professional sports.

87
00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.910
But this is systematic of the general
challenge of interdependence.

88
00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.110
When you're trying to
analyze how good somebody is,

89
00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:00.160
how successful they've been,
you've got to somehow

90
00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.540
parse the individual performance
from the team and it's difficult.

91
00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.980
The main thing is to be careful,
to not over attribute.

92
00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:10.950
Individual performance is something that
is fundamentally at the group level.

93
00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:15.700
So this is, one prescription would be,
as much as possible,

94
00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:18.775
make your performance
evaluations at the group level.

95
00:05:18.775 --> 00:05:21.880
And,convention is to make these
at the individual level, but

96
00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.380
as we gain greater and greater
appreciation for how interdependent

97
00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:29.940
performance is the performance evaluation
should migrate more to the group level.

98
00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:33.630
We also might think about you're not
real sure how someone's doing if it's so

99
00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:36.340
interdependent until you've seen
them perform with multiple teams,

100
00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:39.780
you need to see them in multiple
environments before you can reliably say

101
00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.790
they are the reason these
teams are succeeding.

102
00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:46.870
And then finally, increasingly we
get some performance measures that

103
00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:48.590
analytics is helping with this.

104
00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:51.940
That assess an individual's
impact on a team.

105
00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:55.820
So there have been some studies recently,
for example, in network analytics,

106
00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:59.530
where you can find,
who team members go to for

107
00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:02.390
support, who team members go to for
advice.

108
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:06.860
So even if they don't show up as stars
to those who are evaluating them,

109
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.310
if you look at the actual
behavior of the team members

110
00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:12.390
you can suss out who's making
the biggest contribution.

111
00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:16.000
Techniques like that are gonna help
us get a better and better lens

112
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.210
on where that individual contribution is,
parsing it from the interdependence.
