00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.867
The fourth and final challenge with talent
analytics that I wanna emphasize today is

2
00:00:07.867 --> 00:00:09.530
reverse causality.

3
00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:11.570
And this is the tendency,

4
00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.040
when we see two correlated factors,
to believe that one causes the other.

5
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.440
Especially if there's an intuitive
direction, we look for

6
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.640
this kind of casuality as natural for
us to seek it.

7
00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.410
But the trouble is, often the casuality,
there may be no casuality at all but

8
00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.630
worse, the casuality might actually
go in the other direction.

9
00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.140
So for example,
are charismatic leaders more successful?

10
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.600
This is a widely held opinion and
it makes a lot of sense.

11
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.100
One can make the argument that well
there's all these benefits to being

12
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.690
charismatic.

13
00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.890
It's naturally associated
with successful leaders.

14
00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.330
And so sure.

15
00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:48.330
Let's just go with that.

16
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:49.680
Charismatic leaders are more successful.

17
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.290
Fortunately for us,
a few people have studied this.

18
00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.420
Agle et al a few years ago published
a paper in the Academy of Management where

19
00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:04.610
they looked at charisma and
success among 128 CEOs of major US firms.

20
00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.490
They used a longitudinal design so

21
00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.650
they could look at the perceptions at
one time and the outcomes at another.

22
00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.298
So, what they found was that
charismatic CEOs did not actually have

23
00:01:15.298 --> 00:01:18.370
more organizational success down the road.

24
00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.555
But interestingly, successful CEOs
were perceived as more charismatic.

25
00:01:22.555 --> 00:01:27.360
So it is not the case that charisma
leads leaders to be more successful, but

26
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.990
rather just the opposite.

27
00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.870
That the success itself breathes in us
the perception that they're charismatic.

28
00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:39.210
We find similar dynamics around power and
the warning

29
00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.040
is that we have to be very careful about
what causal stories we tell ourselves.

30
00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.324
So we're driven to make
sense of the world.

31
00:01:46.324 --> 00:01:48.580
We're driven to make sense
of the world we live in,

32
00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.070
to build causal stories
from what we observe.

33
00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.880
The trouble is that leads us to
see things that don't exist.

34
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.470
It leads us to give people credit and

35
00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.530
people blame,
in situations they may not deserve it.

36
00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.640
An interesting study that showed
this in kind of profound ways was

37
00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.460
an early study,1977 study by Jim March,

38
00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.840
the very famous organizational scholar
Jim March, and his son, also James March.

39
00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.610
They looked at the careers of
school's superintendent in Wisconsin.

40
00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.040
So they got this great data set,

41
00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.400
they could look over a long
stretch of time, 32 years.

42
00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.910
Everybody who had been
a superintendent in the state, and

43
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.840
the trajectory of their career.

44
00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.050
So you can imagine,
how do you think this goes?

45
00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.070
What would you expect to be the story?

46
00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:34.740
You would expect that there's this great
range in abilities among superintendents.

47
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.340
And there are a range of
differences in the jobs.

48
00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.580
You might want the jobs in the bigger
cities and not be as interested,

49
00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.580
or maybe a few people want them,
in the you can call it small towns.

50
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.150
But you'd expect great variation in both
places, and there's probably this formal

51
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.580
evaluation system that makes sure that the
best people get placed in the best jobs.

52
00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.270
This is what we'd expect, this is kinda
what the system is designed to do.

53
00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:58.660
What they found, however,

54
00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.730
is that when you look at what happens,
it is very difficult to distinguish

55
00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:09.440
the observed career paths from what you'd
expect from a completely random process.

56
00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.820
That even though we might look and say,
well this superintendent achieved this

57
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.420
success, or this superintendent achieved
this failure, or this guy's in this place,

58
00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.920
this woman is in that place,
for certain stories.

59
00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.420
We can tell the stories.

60
00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.460
It turns out there's
very little difference.

61
00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:28.330
It's hard to find any difference
from what we observe in the data and

62
00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.800
what we would've expected if it was
just completely randomly distributed.

63
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.040
Matching people to jobs by chance.

64
00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.800
So, these guys conclude their study
with a profound statement that's a good

65
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.340
warning to all of us
about reverse causality.

66
00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.690
The normative lesson is, the stories
we tell each other about success and

67
00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.810
failure in top management,
like the stories we tell about success and

68
00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.300
failure in gambling, are in large part

69
00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.550
fictions intended to reassure us about
justice and encourage the young.

70
00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.770
So a little bit of a cynical note
from Jim March, his son there.

71
00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:02.850
But it's well intended.

72
00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:07.620
It's well intended because he wants to
urge us, don't draw these inferences.

73
00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.830
Be careful about causal reasoning.

74
00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:12.850
Be aware that often the causality
runs the other way.

75
00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.220
And you've gotta run the data, basically.

76
00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.350
The principle means by which you do this
with talent analytics is make sure you

77
00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.910
have some causal structure in your data,
that you're using longitudinal panels,

78
00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.770
that you're very careful about the
inferences you have to draw when you're

79
00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.410
stuck with just correlational data.
