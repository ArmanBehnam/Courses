00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:07.807
Hello and
welcome to our module on talent analytics,

2
00:00:07.807 --> 00:00:10.860
an important part of people analytics.

3
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.810
You might wonder what is talent analytics,
what is talent management?

4
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:19.060
This is something that gets talked
about in a lot of quarters.

5
00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.548
People have different perspectives,
different definitions on this.

6
00:00:22.548 --> 00:00:26.691
For our purposes today, we are going to
talk about talent analytics as talent

7
00:00:26.691 --> 00:00:28.820
assessment and development.

8
00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.450
We are interested in identifying
differences in ability.

9
00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.120
And we're interested in
developing those abilities so

10
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.950
that everyone in a firm is maximized.

11
00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.600
So this is a particular take.

12
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.170
You can think of it as something
deeper than performance evaluation.

13
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.146
We had a module on performance evaluation.

14
00:00:45.146 --> 00:00:49.994
And at that point we tried to
keep everyone thinking about

15
00:00:49.994 --> 00:00:52.827
employees as relatively equal.

16
00:00:52.827 --> 00:00:56.041
And we're trying to understand
whether an employee is working hard or

17
00:00:56.041 --> 00:00:59.200
slacking off when we think
about performance evaluation.

18
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.880
Now we wanna go deeper and ask about
assessing differences in employees.

19
00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:04.843
This is a harder task.

20
00:01:04.843 --> 00:01:09.051
It usually takes a longer time, and
there are unique challenges involved.

21
00:01:09.051 --> 00:01:13.670
And so that's what the topic for
today is, employee evaluation.

22
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.230
We're gonna approach it from
an analytic perspective, so

23
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.770
we're gonna consider it talent analytics.

24
00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.970
A motivating case for
talent analytics is promotion.

25
00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:27.180
This is kind of the canonical reason
you would need to assess employability.

26
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.190
And this is hugely important to
firms who you put into power,

27
00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:32.870
into positions of power.

28
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:38.220
Usually there are many contenders, and so
it's a challenging assessment exercise.

29
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.830
And adding to the difficulty is that

30
00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.980
the measures on which you're making
this assessment are typically ambiguous.

31
00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.260
So what are you gonna do?

32
00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.710
And importantly how do you do this well?

33
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.080
This is where we're going.

34
00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.330
This is the kind of thing we want
to tool you up to do better so

35
00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:55.900
we wanna give you a few guidelines.

36
00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.820
This is the outline for the day.

37
00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.200
We're going to talk chiefly about
challenges involved with talent analytics.

38
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.920
There's some well-known
traps that people fall into.

39
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.520
Despite the fact that data is helpful,

40
00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.420
data can actually exacerbate
some of these traps.

41
00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.300
Before we leave we're going
to take a special topic,

42
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.600
one of unique interest in the last year or
two around tests and algorithms.

43
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.050
And then finally we're going
talk about some prescription,

44
00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.440
some practical tips for
you in doing talent analytics better.

45
00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.484
So, first up challenges, data's good.

46
00:02:30.484 --> 00:02:36.060
A lot of data typically better,
but data can also be misleading.

47
00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.830
If you're doing talent analytics,
you're probably working with data.

48
00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.292
You're crunching numbers.

49
00:02:40.292 --> 00:02:44.567
You're crunching performance evaluation,
test scores, 360 feedback, sales figures,

50
00:02:44.567 --> 00:02:47.007
employee morale,
whatever you can get your hands on.

51
00:02:47.007 --> 00:02:50.021
If you're resourceful,
you're probably crunching those numbers.

52
00:02:50.021 --> 00:02:52.550
But what do they mean?

53
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:57.519
Before you can draw any strong inferences,
you've got to navigate a few challenges.

54
00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:01.286
It's critical, in fact, it's critical
if you're going to do talent analytics

55
00:03:01.286 --> 00:03:03.320
well that you navigate these challenges.

56
00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.910
Four chiefly that we're interested in and
that we're going to focus on today.

57
00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.484
Context, interdependence,
self-fulfilling prophecies,

58
00:03:11.484 --> 00:03:16.234
and reverse causality,
each of these will be a separate segment.

59
00:03:16.234 --> 00:03:19.610
And we wanna start with context.

60
00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:25.610
So, it is well understood in psychology,
and increasingly understood

61
00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:30.080
in organizations, that people neglect
context when evaluating performance.

62
00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.030
We tend to believe when we see someone
perform that that performance is due to

63
00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:40.310
some unique individual skill or
unique individual personality trait.

64
00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:47.420
And we underestimate, we under-attribute
the situation the person was in.

65
00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.404
So what are situational factors?

66
00:03:49.404 --> 00:03:51.887
They might have had an easy task or
a difficult task.

67
00:03:51.887 --> 00:03:54.494
They might have had a helpful team or
a harmful team.

68
00:03:54.494 --> 00:03:58.390
They might be working in a good economy or
a bad economy.

69
00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.160
These are very influential factors.

70
00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.360
These are situational factors
that don't have anything to

71
00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.060
do with whether they're a nice guy or
a bad guy, a hard worker or slacker.

72
00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.270
These are situational factors
that we tend to underestimate

73
00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:13.660
when we're trying to infer whether
this person is good at their job.

74
00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.317
So this is so well known it's considered
the fundamental attribution error.

75
00:04:17.317 --> 00:04:21.820
In psychology it's been this focus
of study for more than 40 years now.

76
00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.670
And we know that people are inclined
to blame personality traits,

77
00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:28.810
individual traits as opposed
to situational traits.

78
00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.020
In this segment, what we're trying
to get you to do is go back and

79
00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.900
consider situational trades,
consider the context.

80
00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.200
When you're crunching the numbers,

81
00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.060
you have to figure out ways to make
sure you're considering the context.

82
00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:45.680
So, there's a saying in Wall Street that
is designed to help offset this bias.

83
00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.550
The saying is,
don't confuse brains in a bull market.

84
00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:53.013
What they mean by that is, in a bull
market, everybody's making money.

85
00:04:53.013 --> 00:04:55.125
Everybody's trades seem to work out.

86
00:04:55.125 --> 00:04:58.266
And people very readily infer
then that they are good or

87
00:04:58.266 --> 00:05:02.171
that their portfolio manager,
their investment manager is good.

88
00:05:02.171 --> 00:05:03.877
And these guys are saying, hey, hold on.

89
00:05:03.877 --> 00:05:06.009
That was an easy situation basically.

90
00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:08.660
The context was everyone made money.

91
00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:13.371
So they've boiled that down to a very
pithy comment, don't confuse brains and

92
00:05:13.371 --> 00:05:14.298
a bull market.

93
00:05:14.298 --> 00:05:16.674
We want to build those kind of heuristics,

94
00:05:16.674 --> 00:05:21.800
those helpful corrective heuristics
in the way you evaluate your talent.

95
00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.950
So an example, a couple of examples.

96
00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:30.940
We did, in the performance evaluation
module, an example of this.

97
00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:35.314
So you may recall, if you've seen this
module already, that when we looked at

98
00:05:35.314 --> 00:05:39.957
this extended example from the NFL of
evaluating draft picks, and in particular,

99
00:05:39.957 --> 00:05:41.906
teams' ability to pick players.

100
00:05:41.906 --> 00:05:47.179
Teams' ability to hire the right players,
the first thing we did was norm for

101
00:05:47.179 --> 00:05:51.250
expectations as a function of
where the team was drafting.

102
00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:56.510
So teams that draft high in the NFL draft
should get better players cuz there

103
00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:58.280
are better players available.

104
00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.240
Teams that draft low
should get worse players.

105
00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:05.260
So we already demonstrated
this technique of norming for

106
00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.670
expectations, and
we want to build on that here.

107
00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:13.002
So what I want to do now is give you a new
example also from the world of sports, but

108
00:06:13.002 --> 00:06:16.928
one that is especially designed to convey
this context idea especially well.

109
00:06:16.928 --> 00:06:19.657
So this is from American baseball, and

110
00:06:19.657 --> 00:06:25.130
mid 20th century American baseball,
and it's comes to us from Bill James.

111
00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:28.500
Bill James wrote about
this in one of his books.

112
00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:32.430
And it's a comparison of two second
basemen, interesting for a few reasons.

113
00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:34.160
They played at about the same time.

114
00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:38.990
This is Bobby Doerr of the Boston Red Sox
and Joe Gordon of the New York Yankees.

115
00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:40.560
They played about the same time.

116
00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.280
They played the same position.

117
00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:43.941
They were both from Southern California.

118
00:06:43.941 --> 00:06:46.160
And they were both very successful.

119
00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:50.600
But after their careers,
one was much more lauded than the other.

120
00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:56.160
Bobby Doerr went on to Hall of Fame
election quite readily and was considered,

121
00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.670
with the passing of years was considered
the better of the two players.

122
00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:03.110
Joe Gordon,
who at the time had been well considered,

123
00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:08.650
slipped significantly behind
Bobby Doerr and in fact wasn't elected

124
00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:12.620
to the Hall of Fame until Bill James
started this campaign and this analysis.

125
00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:13.960
So let's dig into the numbers.

126
00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:18.030
Much as you might dig into numbers as
you decide who to promote in your firm,

127
00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:21.002
let's dig into the numbers and
see what they tell us and

128
00:07:21.002 --> 00:07:24.056
what mistakes we could fall
into if we're not careful.

129
00:07:24.056 --> 00:07:25.840
I'm going to show you some baseball stats.

130
00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.620
And it doesn't matter if
you understand baseball.

131
00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:32.029
All that matters in a few key
columns higher is better.

132
00:07:32.029 --> 00:07:34.580
You can think of this as
sales in your organization.

133
00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:37.190
You can think of this as employee morale.

134
00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:39.960
You can think of this as 360
degree feedback, whatever.

135
00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:44.390
This is a performance measure for these
two players, Bobby Doerr and Joe Gordon.

136
00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:49.320
What I'm showing you are their batting
statistics in their home ballpark.

137
00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:53.250
So they spent half of their careers
essentially in their home ballpark.

138
00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:56.930
And then they spend the other half
on the road playing away games.

139
00:07:56.930 --> 00:08:00.151
What's interesting about these two
characters is that they played their home

140
00:08:00.151 --> 00:08:01.576
ballparks were quite different.

141
00:08:01.576 --> 00:08:07.080
So Bobby Doerr played at Fenway,
a small hitter friendly park.

142
00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:08.860
Joe Gordon played in Yankee Stadium,

143
00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:11.920
famously cavernous,
not as friendly to hitters.

144
00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:12.850
What do you see?

145
00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:17.344
Well, if you look across the key
stats are Doerr had more home runs.

146
00:08:17.344 --> 00:08:23.530
He had quite a bit more hits, more home
runs, more RBIs, which is runs batted in.

147
00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:25.044
Overall, his average was a little higher.

148
00:08:25.044 --> 00:08:27.459
His on base percentage
was a little higher.

149
00:08:27.459 --> 00:08:32.080
His slugging percentage, across
the board he's better in his home park.

150
00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:35.580
But, we've already said they're
batting in very different places.

151
00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:38.784
In other words, the context isn't
the same for these two guys.

152
00:08:38.784 --> 00:08:42.400
If we want to evaluate them, we need
to put them on a level playing field.

153
00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.340
We need to make sure
it's apples to apples.

154
00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:47.880
And the best way to do that is to look
at the other half of their record,

155
00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:51.930
the other half being where they are,
what they do in the visitor park.

156
00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:53.090
So what does that look like?

157
00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:55.890
Here the story is very different.

158
00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:59.260
Doerr still has more hits because
in fact he has more at bats.

159
00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:03.710
But he has significantly fewer home runs,
significantly fewer runs batted in,

160
00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:07.530
a worse batting average,
a worse on base percentage average, and

161
00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:08.590
a lower slugging percentage.

162
00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:11.670
Across the board he
performs worse than Gordon,

163
00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:16.290
even though the line looked very different
when you were looking at his home park.

164
00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:20.010
This, though, is where we've
contextualized the performance.

165
00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:22.712
This is where it's a level playing field.

166
00:09:22.712 --> 00:09:26.714
And if you don't break it out like this,
if you only look at their career numbers,

167
00:09:26.714 --> 00:09:28.168
you don't get this picture.

168
00:09:28.168 --> 00:09:31.743
And you think they're about the same or
maybe think Bobby Doerr's better.

169
00:09:31.743 --> 00:09:33.969
When you contextualize the performance,

170
00:09:33.969 --> 00:09:37.674
when you say how do they compare when
they're on a level playing field,

171
00:09:37.674 --> 00:09:40.740
it's quite clear that Joe Gordon
was the better batter.

172
00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:43.840
By the way they were known
both as good fielders.

173
00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:45.620
This is what really distinguished them.

174
00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:48.400
Once Bill James made this case,
he broke out the stats in this way,

175
00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:51.340
in other words he contextualized
their performance.

176
00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:53.594
He made a strong argument for
Joe Gordon making the Hall of Fame.

177
00:09:53.594 --> 00:09:57.100
And in fact because of Bill James
he was elected to the Hall of Fame.

178
00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:00.240
This is the kind of promotion
decision we want your firms to make.

179
00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:04.880
We want you to avoid the mistakes
that the Hall of Fame made for years.

180
00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:07.110
We want you to add this kind of context.

181
00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:09.750
So another quick example
a more recent sporting event,

182
00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:14.740
the World Cup a year and
a half ago now in 2014.

183
00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:20.840
There was a match where the U.S. was beat
by Belgium I believe and beat handily.

184
00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:22.180
In that match the U.S.

185
00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:27.220
goalie Tim Howard faced an unprecedented
number of shots on the goal.

186
00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:30.809
He let two goals in, and so it might
not look that strong a performance.

187
00:10:30.809 --> 00:10:32.639
But in the context of what he faced,

188
00:10:32.639 --> 00:10:36.020
it turned out to be
an extraordinary performance.

189
00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:40.670
And Nate Silver,
Nate Silver of ESPN's 538,

190
00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:46.580
famously for forecasting US elections
did a little analysis after this game,

191
00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:48.770
after the whole World Cup
as a matter of fact.

192
00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:51.240
And said who in the World Cup
performed best?

193
00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:54.810
Who was the best goalie during
this particular sporting event?

194
00:10:56.140 --> 00:11:01.078
And he named Howard's performance
actually, against Belgium.

195
00:11:01.078 --> 00:11:02.940
Despite having let in two goals,

196
00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:06.950
he said that when you contextualize
his performance, it was the best.

197
00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:10.897
Considering what he faced,
he faced 16 shots on goal.

198
00:11:10.897 --> 00:11:15.906
16 shots on goal, he would have expected,
if you just ask across all matches,

199
00:11:15.906 --> 00:11:19.957
all goalies, all teams,
when someone faces 16 shots on goal,

200
00:11:19.957 --> 00:11:22.852
how many goals would you
expect them to allow?

201
00:11:22.852 --> 00:11:24.850
And then the answer's four and half.

202
00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:25.550
What did he allow?

203
00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:26.720
He only allowed two.

204
00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:30.460
So he actually gained as a goalie,
his performance was to gain two and

205
00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:31.500
a half goals.

206
00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:35.540
That's a very different take on his
performance than that he let in two goals,

207
00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:38.450
but it's a more contextually
appropriate take.

208
00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:41.390
So only by considering
the context of his performance

209
00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:43.870
can we actually understand
how good it actually was.

210
00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:46.970
And once we do that we
can differentiate Howard

211
00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:49.890
from the other good goal performances
we saw in the World Cup.

212
00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:54.440
So in general,
this is what we're pushing you to do.

213
00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:57.640
And it's gonna look different
in each firm, in each industry.

214
00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:02.320
But you've gotta find ways to make
the performance evaluations, the employee

215
00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:05.430
evaluations is really what we're
talking about here, apples to apples.

216
00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:08.490
You've got to find ways to
level the playing field.

217
00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:13.360
The most general way to think about this
is performance relative to expectations.

218
00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:15.540
What would the performance have been,

219
00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:18.010
what does it look like
relative to expectations?

220
00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:21.430
This might be driven by the person's team,
by the product he or

221
00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:24.790
she is in charge of,
by the industry they are participating in,

222
00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:27.340
by the broader economy,
by the person's boss.

223
00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:31.290
All of these are factors that might in
some circumstances make a big difference

224
00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:32.390
in how they perform.

225
00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:33.790
You've got to norm for that.

226
00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:35.091
You've got to control for
that in some way.

227
00:12:35.091 --> 00:12:39.221
In order to compare person A working for
one boss to person B working for

228
00:12:39.221 --> 00:12:42.301
a different boss,
you've got to somehow adjust for

229
00:12:42.301 --> 00:12:45.010
that boss' effect on their performance.

230
00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:45.871
This is context.

231
00:12:45.871 --> 00:12:48.620
This is something we know
people don't do very well.

232
00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:50.910
And it's critical to
good talent analytics.
