1
00:00:04.711 --> 00:00:09.420
The final segment is on prescriptions,
and these are two things.

2
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.450
One, they're practical tips, but

3
00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.090
they're also kind of logical implications
of everything we've said so far.

4
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.970
They're intended to be ways of helping you
navigate the challenges that we've just

5
00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:19.549
kind of unpacked.

6
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.550
The first is broaden your sample.

7
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.460
And this flows directly our of
the point we were just making

8
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.530
about using multiple signals when tapping
into these new tests in algorithms.

9
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.500
So just as we said with good
performance evaluation, you want to

10
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.690
expand the sources and signals when
you're trying to evaluate your talent.

11
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.550
So additional opinions, additional
performance metrics, additional projects,

12
00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.590
and assignments if possible.

13
00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.670
The key is that we want them from
the maximally diverse sources.

14
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.150
You want uncorrelated
signals as much as possible.

15
00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.410
The most valuable signal that you can
add to the portfolio that you have

16
00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.660
is something completely
uncorrelated to everything else.

17
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.206
Another implication,

18
00:01:02.206 --> 00:01:06.379
another type of sample we're talking
is to give people second chances.

19
00:01:06.379 --> 00:01:09.205
And in fact, to give people third chances.

20
00:01:09.205 --> 00:01:12.425
It follows directly from all
the challenges we said above

21
00:01:12.425 --> 00:01:16.375
that it's really hard to
evaluate a person's performance,

22
00:01:16.375 --> 00:01:18.805
whether they have the ability
to do what you want them to do.

23
00:01:18.805 --> 00:01:20.075
Whether they're the right person for

24
00:01:20.075 --> 00:01:23.550
your organization, until you've
seen them in multiple settings.

25
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.220
For example we know that a person's
boss greatly affects their performance.

26
00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.150
We also know that in almost all
circumstances a new employee has no

27
00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.200
control over who their boss is.

28
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.310
So, how can it be that
we can truly evaluate

29
00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.030
a person's ability on a job until we've
seen them work for more than one person?

30
00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.310
Or maybe even more than two,
or three people?

31
00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.414
We need to see people in different
settings before we can really say

32
00:01:45.414 --> 00:01:50.710
a reliably what it is about
how good a fit they are,

33
00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.110
how much talent they actually have for
this particular organization.

34
00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.540
So, that suggests second chances,
third chances.

35
00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.713
It falls directly from everything
we've been talking about.

36
00:02:00.713 --> 00:02:04.126
A second prescription, and
it's related, is to find and

37
00:02:04.126 --> 00:02:07.340
create what the economist
call exogenous variation.

38
00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.290
You gotta find outside influences, you
gotta find outside sources of variation.

39
00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.530
So, the only truly valid
way to tease out causation

40
00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.930
is to manipulate an employees environment.

41
00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.280
If you don't manipulate it,
then you can never know for

42
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.230
sure what actually is driving
the results that you observe.

43
00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.640
So, some ideas here are they
require a trade off.

44
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.050
So, we can't sadly, [LAUGH] we can't
just run around running experiments in

45
00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.960
organizations to see who's best at
a job or who's truly good at a job.

46
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.171
You still have to run the business.

47
00:02:38.171 --> 00:02:42.523
So, we understand that, but we wanna
push you back a little bit towards your

48
00:02:42.523 --> 00:02:47.296
long term success in organization is gonna
depend on identifying the best people.

49
00:02:47.296 --> 00:02:50.427
And developing people,
identifying strengths, and weaknesses, and

50
00:02:50.427 --> 00:02:52.250
developing their weaknesses.

51
00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.400
Those require intentionality
around this kind of variation.

52
00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.750
You need to see people in different
situations, in order to know what they're

53
00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.410
strong at and you can build on, and what
they're weak at and you need to work on.

54
00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.140
You could either put them in
different situations to identify

55
00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.750
the best at a particular job.

56
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.010
You can't do that unless you
get this exogenous variation.

57
00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.550
So, it requires a little trade off, but
some of that trade off is worthwhile,

58
00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.070
you give up a little bit
of operational efficiency

59
00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.030
to learn something about your talent.

60
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.120
This search for exogenous variation
is one of the major motivation for

61
00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.580
rotational programs.

62
00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.110
So in many organizations, especially
when people are first brought on to

63
00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.790
an organization, they get sorted
into various environments over say,

64
00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.310
their first three months, or six months,
or sometimes two years, three years.

65
00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.320
IBM for years,
ran a trading program that was

66
00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.610
a leadership development
program that was years long.

67
00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:47.440
They explicitly wanted to put people in a
different context to see how they perform,

68
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.410
and they wanted to commit ahead of time
to doing that, and doing in at set times.

69
00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.660
This is exogenous variation,
this is a great example

70
00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.800
of kinda taken this experimental
approach to leadership development.

71
00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.281
So, [SOUND] this is the gold standard for

72
00:04:04.281 --> 00:04:09.024
sussing out the true ability,
and truth strengths and

73
00:04:09.024 --> 00:04:14.921
weaknesses of your employees is to
commit to that kind of rotation.

74
00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:18.327
However, we know that you can't always
do that, and you can't do that for

75
00:04:18.327 --> 00:04:19.310
all your employees.

76
00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.720
And later in life, and later in their
career you can't do it as readily.

77
00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.790
So, you need to look for
lesser variations.

78
00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:29.270
Look, this is a rationale for changing
teams, pushing people around to different

79
00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.730
teams, changing direct reports,
changing projects, changing offices.

80
00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:36.640
Any source of variation changes
up the environment, and

81
00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.879
gives you a better lens into the true
underlying ability of the employee.

82
00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.930
A third prescription, and
this is a very general prescription,

83
00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.130
and that is to reward in
proportion to the signal.

84
00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.830
The idea here is that you
should match the duration and

85
00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.540
complexity of rewards to the duration and
complexity of the past accomplishments.

86
00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:01.754
So, We've talked a lot about how its
tough to get these strong signals.

87
00:05:01.754 --> 00:05:07.048
The challenges of pulling from the data
true inference, so if you're stuck

88
00:05:07.048 --> 00:05:12.520
with only weak signals you need to only
base weak rewards on those signals.

89
00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.470
Conversely if you're able to do some
of these more sophisticated things

90
00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:18.760
running experiments Pushing people
around into different environments,

91
00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.170
working with someone for
years in lots of different situations.

92
00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:23.640
Once you have that kind of signal,
substantial,

93
00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:28.300
clear signal, then you can offer
substantial rewards in proportion.

94
00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:33.320
So for short noisy signals, better to
give things, like bonuses than raises.

95
00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.270
Better to give praise than promotions
because they're based on relatively flimsy

96
00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:38.840
information.

97
00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:39.879
So, couple notes here.

98
00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:42.184
One, most signals are noisy, and

99
00:05:42.184 --> 00:05:46.160
importantly we're prone to
underestimate that noise.

100
00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.860
So, we talked a lot about this in
the performance evaluation module.

101
00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:53.420
Individuals underestimate
the role of chance,

102
00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:56.540
we underestimate the noise
in these signals.

103
00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:00.360
Therefore, we're inclined to think we
understand which employees are best, and

104
00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.440
which are worse more than we actually can.

105
00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.501
We're over confident in our ability
to identify one from the other,

106
00:06:05.501 --> 00:06:06.838
so what's the implication?

107
00:06:06.838 --> 00:06:11.460
We probably over-reward, we put too
much in response to these signals.

108
00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:12.660
We need to learn to dampen that.

109
00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:15.060
You gotta recognize when
you've got weak signals, and

110
00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:19.310
you need to match in proportion
the rewards, the longevity of what

111
00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:23.260
you're giving employees in proportion
to what signal it's based on.

112
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:28.379
Second note is that, well, on the other
hand you have to retain people.

113
00:06:28.379 --> 00:06:30.733
So, one of the reasons you
give people promotions,

114
00:06:30.733 --> 00:06:34.335
one of the reasons you give people bonuses
is to keep them from leaving the firm.

115
00:06:34.335 --> 00:06:37.129
You've gotta compete in
this external labor market.

116
00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:40.088
Fine, good, but there's a premium on,

117
00:06:40.088 --> 00:06:45.825
there's competitive advantage in being
an accurate evaluator of talent.

118
00:06:45.825 --> 00:06:47.385
And if someone else wants to come in and

119
00:06:47.385 --> 00:06:51.865
overreact to a signal that you happen
to know is noisy, a single that's not

120
00:06:51.865 --> 00:06:54.460
based on some of these deeper principles
that we've been talking about.

121
00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:56.610
Then maybe it's okay to
let them be hired away.

122
00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:00.490
You wanna be the act to judge, you wanna
have a compare to advantage in evaluating

123
00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:03.960
people better, and if others wanna prior
to these mistakes, you should let them.

124
00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:06.110
It's only gonna make
your company stronger.

125
00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:08.350
In general, draw a major distinctions, and

126
00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:11.430
grant major rewards only when
following major signals.

127
00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:15.780
This is the principle behind partnership,
and consulting in law firms.

128
00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:18.060
It's also the principle behind
the academic tenure, so

129
00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:20.560
academic tenure is almost irrevocable.

130
00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:23.870
So, you wanna be very
careful about granting that.

131
00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:24.620
Who do they grant it to?

132
00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:28.058
They grant it to relatively few,
and they granted only after 5 or

133
00:07:28.058 --> 00:07:30.980
10 years worth of essentially probation.

134
00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:35.036
Junior faculty are essentially on
probation, and it's a year's long,

135
00:07:35.036 --> 00:07:39.018
[LAUGH] no guaranteed I'd track,
but that's what it takes.

136
00:07:39.018 --> 00:07:43.290
That's why the organizations do that,
hundreds of years

137
00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:47.815
tradition has built it that way because
the reward on the other side is so heavy.

138
00:07:47.815 --> 00:07:51.310
You don't wanna give that strong a reward,
you don't wanna give such a long

139
00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:53.950
lasting reward,
unless it's based on a very strong signal.

140
00:07:55.810 --> 00:08:02.750
An example of this done well was
the succession of Jack Welch as CEO at GE.

141
00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:06.610
So, Jack Welch is probably the most
celebrated CEO in the history of the US.

142
00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:09.483
He was CEO of GE for 20 years, and

143
00:08:09.483 --> 00:08:15.047
led that organization to the very
top of the multinational world.

144
00:08:15.047 --> 00:08:19.788
And in about 2000, 2001,
he was going to retire, and

145
00:08:19.788 --> 00:08:23.200
he had to decide who was
going to succeed him.

146
00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:25.360
And now, they'd done planning,
of course, for years, but

147
00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:28.020
in the end, it came down to three people.

148
00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:31.370
And they had to somehow assess,
which of these three should take over for

149
00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:32.220
the great Jack Welch.

150
00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:33.700
So, what do they do?

151
00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:36.945
They ended up running what
is considered a tournament.

152
00:08:36.945 --> 00:08:40.150
So, this notion tournament, of course,
many people know it from sports.

153
00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:43.371
But actually Eddie Lazear and
Sherwin Rosen, economists,

154
00:08:43.371 --> 00:08:47.352
came up with this notion as personnel
evaluation that in some situations,

155
00:08:47.352 --> 00:08:51.490
the best way to evaluate personnel
is to put them in a tournament.

156
00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:54.670
And that's essentially what
Welch did with these three.

157
00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:59.564
So, he had Jeff Immelt, Jim McNerney, and
Bob Nardelli all as viable contenders, but

158
00:08:59.564 --> 00:09:02.741
he's got all the challenges
we've been talking about,

159
00:09:02.741 --> 00:09:06.671
everything we've been talking about
holds here, so what does he do?

160
00:09:06.671 --> 00:09:08.835
He basically announced to them and

161
00:09:08.835 --> 00:09:13.311
to the world that this were the three
finalist, and he's gonna observe

162
00:09:13.311 --> 00:09:18.030
their performance over the next period
of time to see who should be the CEO.

163
00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:20.130
This is obviously a big reward, right?

164
00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:22.470
This is a big long standing reward, so

165
00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:26.440
it needs to be based on big clear signals,
how does he do that?

166
00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:29.615
He made each one,
the head of large divisions within GE.

167
00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:34.169
And he made the game clear, and
then he followed their performances for

168
00:09:34.169 --> 00:09:36.172
not a short period of time,
but for a year.

169
00:09:36.172 --> 00:09:40.423
Of course he had a career of
watching them to that point, but

170
00:09:40.423 --> 00:09:42.889
the tournament lasted a year, and

171
00:09:42.889 --> 00:09:48.090
it was a way to get a very substantial
signal in separating these guys.

172
00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:49.890
They were all working the same economy,
of course,

173
00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:53.410
it's not perfectly apples to apples,
he still had to do whatever he could

174
00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:57.560
to make sure that playing to this level to
contextualize each of their performance.

175
00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:59.420
But within the he'd faced,

176
00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:03.090
this was a fantastic way to get
that comparison apples to apples.

177
00:10:04.818 --> 00:10:10.150
So, McNerney joked at the end of this,
Welch reports this in one of his books,

178
00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:14.570
McNerney joked, McNerney didn't get it,
Jeff got it and he still the CEO of CEO.

179
00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:18.610
McNerney said, he wanted recap, it's
the first thing he said, but he added,

180
00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:20.480
I want you to know I wanted the job, but

181
00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:22.850
I also want to tell you I
think the process was fair.

182
00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:25.140
So, this was the biggest competition for

183
00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:30.570
CEO in US history, one of the losers
here reported that not only

184
00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:35.350
during the outside thing that the process
was an effective way to identify the best.

185
00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:38.020
McNerney, as one of the people
participating in it thought it was

186
00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:39.060
a fair way.

187
00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:42.070
So, prescription number 4,
is to emphasize development.

188
00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:46.750
Most of this module we've been talking
about assessment, but talent analytics is

189
00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:51.570
at least as much about development,
as it is about assessment and selection.

190
00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:55.546
So, we wanna emphasize that it's not
just finding the next Jeff Immelt.

191
00:10:55.546 --> 00:10:59.398
It's also about, all your employees
identifying strengths and weaknesses,

192
00:10:59.398 --> 00:11:02.900
building on the strengths, and
shoring up the weaknesses.

193
00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:06.470
So, you can see this within an industry
that is famous for selecting, and

194
00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:08.080
making bets, venture capital.

195
00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:10.210
Often people think of them
as just standing back,

196
00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:15.240
and assessing which firm to bet on,
which entrepreneurs to bet on.

197
00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:20.890
But they spend considerable time, actually
investing in developing those managers,

198
00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:24.120
investing in developing the entrepreneurs
is not just about selection.

199
00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:26.900
Even in that world, even such
a selection-dominant world as venture

200
00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:31.050
capital, is significantly
oriented towards development.

201
00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:32.690
Another example comes from sports.

202
00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:35.587
Anthony Davis is one of the best
young basketball players in the NBA.

203
00:11:35.587 --> 00:11:41.190
Most recognized as the best, and he plays
for the organization New Orleans Hornets.

204
00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:45.601
And his development even though he
was very highly regarded coming out,

205
00:11:45.601 --> 00:11:49.810
there are many players who are highly
regarded that don't develop.

206
00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:54.650
It was commented here recently by a noted
basketball analyst Kurt Kingsbury

207
00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:59.504
that part of his success has been not
just because he is intrinsically good.

208
00:11:59.504 --> 00:12:03.282
But because the New Orleans Hornets
are well-known for establishing, for

209
00:12:03.282 --> 00:12:05.467
developing players, so Goldsberry says,

210
00:12:05.467 --> 00:12:09.260
player development is one of the least
understood elements of NBA success.

211
00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:10.997
Everybody knows it's important, and

212
00:12:10.997 --> 00:12:13.530
everyone knows which
organizations excel at it.

213
00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:17.420
Some organizations routinely transform
draft picks into good players,

214
00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:20.880
while perpetual lottery teams,
these are bad teams, commonly sit and

215
00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:22.870
watch them fail to pan out.

216
00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:26.200
So, even in an environment
as closely watched, and

217
00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:32.010
with as much at stake as NBA teams,
there's great variation in firms that

218
00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:34.250
understand and
value the importance of development.

219
00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:35.530
It's not just about assessment,

220
00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:38.690
it's not just about selection,
it's also about development.

221
00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:42.690
There are many more good tools now,
some firms are just using those tools for

222
00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:44.440
selection, they're missing an opportunity.

223
00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:46.280
You can use those good tools for
development as well.

224
00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:51.608
The fifth and final prescription
is to ask the critical question.

225
00:12:51.608 --> 00:12:54.789
So, I wanna end this module in the same
way that we ended the performance

226
00:12:54.789 --> 00:12:57.720
evaluation module, which is to
give you a battery of questions.

227
00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:01.390
Which should be useful across
a wide range of situations.

228
00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:03.020
Sometimes you're gonna be the analyst,

229
00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:06.030
sometimes you're gonna be the one
consuming somebody else's analytics,

230
00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:08.930
sometimes you're just gonna be
the person kibitzing on the side.

231
00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:12.063
These questions should help you
do any of those jobs better, and

232
00:13:12.063 --> 00:13:13.282
it also provides a way for

233
00:13:13.282 --> 00:13:17.129
us to summarize what we've been talking
about over the course of this module.

234
00:13:17.129 --> 00:13:20.520
The first question is,
are we comparing apples to apples?

235
00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:22.230
Always bring this question to the table.

236
00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:25.660
Have we sufficiently adjusted for context?

237
00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:29.337
Right along with this, know that we
tend to not adjust enough for context.

238
00:13:29.337 --> 00:13:31.440
That's why the question is so valuable.

239
00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:35.216
We're prone to not adjust for context,
we need to always push back and

240
00:13:35.216 --> 00:13:37.462
ask, are we comparing apples to apples?

241
00:13:37.462 --> 00:13:40.900
Second, what impact have other
people had on this person's work?

242
00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:43.010
How interdependent are these measures?

243
00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:46.880
Again, we tend to attribute
performance to individuals, and

244
00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:49.930
we need to always push and ask,
what was the context for this?

245
00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:50.530
And in particular,

246
00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:54.260
a special important context is
the team that they're involved in.

247
00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.160
And the team might not be the formal team,

248
00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.259
it might just be the informal
team that influenced the work.

249
00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:03.500
Third question, how have expectations
colored our evaluations?

250
00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:06.100
To what extent have successes and
failures been influenced

251
00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:09.440
by the way we've treated people,
the situations we've put them in?

252
00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:13.270
This isn't meant to rob people of
accountability and responsibility for

253
00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:17.670
their actions, but it is meant for
underscore the influences individuals and

254
00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:21.020
organizations have on
employee performance.

255
00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:24.118
And again,
we underestimate the impact we have,

256
00:14:24.118 --> 00:14:27.656
many of us miss this altogether,
and so this is a check and

257
00:14:27.656 --> 00:14:32.630
a push to evaluate what impact your
expectations are having on your employees.

258
00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:36.190
Finally, are the factors we believe
lead to success and failure,

259
00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:37.890
are they truly causal?

260
00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:41.932
We tell stories, we're prone to tell
stories, we see correlations and

261
00:14:41.932 --> 00:14:45.129
believe that there are causal stories,
do we know that?

262
00:14:45.129 --> 00:14:46.212
Again, a check.

263
00:14:46.212 --> 00:14:49.250
We should know we're prone to go that way.

264
00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:51.630
We need to push back and
ask, is this truly causal?

265
00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:55.450
Is there evidence to that,
is there evidence to the contrary?

266
00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:57.712
So, that's about your questions for you.

267
00:14:57.712 --> 00:15:01.085
It should help as a way of remembering
what we've talked through, but

268
00:15:01.085 --> 00:15:05.190
also as a set of tools you can bring to
any conversation about talent analytics.

269
00:15:05.190 --> 00:15:09.546
And especially to the interpretation of
data that comes out of talent analytics.

270
00:15:09.546 --> 00:15:10.837
We wish you the best with your work.
