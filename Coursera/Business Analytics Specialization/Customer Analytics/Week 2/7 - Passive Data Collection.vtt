1
00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.970
So in terms of passive
unobtrusive data collection,

2
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.080
there are a variety of ways companies
can get data from customers.

3
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.650
This is just one sort of examples.

4
00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:11.560
It can be point of sales data,
for media planning for instance.

5
00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:16.500
It could be data about radio, TV,
social media, kind of audience engagement.

6
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.800
It could be web data, mobile data.

7
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.550
What we wanna do in
this particular module,

8
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.640
we will talk about examples
of different types of data.

9
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:24.780
And more importantly,

10
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:29.790
also related to the type of questions that
people can answer using this type of data.

11
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:31.930
So point of sales data
is just one example.

12
00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.890
So in this example, for instance,
we look at grocery categories, health and

13
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:35.930
beauty products.

14
00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.210
This is just one example of the type
of data that's available to consumers

15
00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:39.749
and firms.

16
00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:46.170
The typical data chain has about 80 to 100
consumer packaging manufacturers, many,

17
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.590
many households.

18
00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.970
And the type of information that's
available is quite dramatic.

19
00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.440
In terms of geography, product, time and

20
00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.219
the type of marketing
variables you can have.

21
00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:58.840
You can have different kinds of stores.

22
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.063
You can have aggregation in terms of SKUs.

23
00:01:01.063 --> 00:01:03.370
You can have aggregation in terms of time.

24
00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.120
Lots of different kinds
of data is available.

25
00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.750
Now, there are many companies
that offer point of sales data.

26
00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.889
I'll give you examples of
the big companies that do so.

27
00:01:11.889 --> 00:01:16.210
ACNielsen is a huge force in
getting point of sales data.

28
00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.100
So that's one example.

29
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.640
IRI is yet another company and
the third company is SPINS.

30
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.190
Now these three companies basically
give you data of different

31
00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:26.589
kinds of point of sales.

32
00:01:26.589 --> 00:01:30.270
So ACNielsen and IRI typically deal with
traditional kinds of stores that you have

33
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.840
in grocery stores, traditional products.

34
00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.590
SPINS gives you lots of information
about organic products.

35
00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.891
So depending on the company you're in,

36
00:01:38.891 --> 00:01:42.479
depending on the products that
you look at, ACNielsen, IRI or

37
00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.015
SPINS might be the ideal company
to give you this type of data.

38
00:01:46.015 --> 00:01:49.500
Now why do people pay so
much for point of sales data?

39
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.470
First, it's quite complete.

40
00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.760
You can link aggregate sales
to marketing instruments.

41
00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:55.450
For example,

42
00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.140
as a marketing manager, you would like
to answer the following question.

43
00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.660
How do promotions impact my sales?

44
00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.060
To answer this question,
you need good data about promotions.

45
00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.292
You need good data about sales.

46
00:02:07.292 --> 00:02:10.090
Point of sales data can
get you that information.

47
00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.810
It's quite timely.

48
00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.240
You can get data of different
types of aggregation.

49
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.290
You can get data within a week,
within a month,

50
00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.900
if you like to make those
kinds of decisions.

51
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.320
And finally it's very accurate.

52
00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.130
Again going back to the questions that you
can try to answer with this type of data.

53
00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.020
One is impact of promotions.

54
00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.050
Who buys our product on promotions?

55
00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.170
Are customers borrowing from future sales?

56
00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.110
Say if I as a costumer buy two
cartons of orange juice today,

57
00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.150
is it borrowing from my future sales?

58
00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.010
I might hold off on buying
future orange juice.

59
00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.990
Will cherry pickers become loyal?

60
00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.700
Say, if I decide to buy, for
example, Tropicana today,

61
00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.530
instead of Minute Maid, because
Tropicana was offering a promotion,

62
00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.460
will I become loyal to Tropicana?

63
00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.720
Those are important questions for
brand managers to understand.

64
00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:56.370
Why?

65
00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.050
Because that tells you what's
the impact of promotions going to be,

66
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:00.920
not just in the short term but
in the long term.

67
00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.280
You can also start thinking what
impact on displays, for example.

68
00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.420
So those of you who go around supermarket
aisles, you can start looking, for

69
00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.410
example, at end of aisle displays,
middle of aisle displays.

70
00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.960
These are little displays which allow
you to see what brands are on promotion.

71
00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.030
How do they work?

72
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.110
Is middle-of-aisle display better
than end-of-aisle display?

73
00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.930
Requires concrete data.

74
00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.420
And finally you can start
thinking about not just

75
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.640
what's the action within
a particular product category,

76
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.920
you can start start thinking about
action across product categories.

77
00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.250
And this is very important from
a retail store manager's perspective.

78
00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:35.830
How is the overall chain doing?

79
00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:37.460
What products are selling together?

80
00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:39.870
What products
are cannibalizing each other?

81
00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.900
All those questions can be very well
answered through point of sales data.

82
00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.570
What are some caveats though?

83
00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:49.160
One caveat is it misses out on
things such as convenience stores.

84
00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.620
Again, in the grocery products
brands such as Whole Foods,

85
00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.159
Aldi, Trader Joe's are not
there in the data set.

86
00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.780
Think back to what we
talked about InfoScout.

87
00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.180
InfoScout is a solution to this.

88
00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.620
InfoScout actually wants people to
take a snapshot of their receipts and

89
00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.160
send it back to them.

90
00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.610
So if these costumers are buying
products at Whole Foods,

91
00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.500
InfoScout will have that information.

92
00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:12.810
But point of sales data may not have it.

93
00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.120
Another example is you cannot
make causal statements.

94
00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.690
What's the problem here?

95
00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:20.480
I would like to know,

96
00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.990
for example, how does my promotion
impact consumer behavior?

97
00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.220
What you can get a lot of information
on is on promotion that was there.

98
00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.890
You can get a lot of information
on what people are buying.

99
00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:33.220
But was there a causal impact of this?

100
00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.750
We'll come back to this when we
talk about causal attribution.

101
00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.610
And we don't know customer
psychographics and finally, we

102
00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.010
also don't know what are the exact set of
products that consumers were looking at.

103
00:04:45.025 --> 00:04:47.475
But still,
keeping all these caveats in mind,

104
00:04:47.475 --> 00:04:51.845
point of sales data is a hugely important
data if you start thinking about

105
00:04:51.845 --> 00:04:55.785
trying to capture what a customer's
buying, what are they buying,

106
00:04:55.785 --> 00:04:58.155
what is overall in their basket,
and so on and so forth.
