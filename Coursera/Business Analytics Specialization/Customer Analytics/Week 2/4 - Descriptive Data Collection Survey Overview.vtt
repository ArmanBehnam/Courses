1
00:00:05.144 --> 00:00:08.440
So in this part, we'll start talking
about descriptive data collection.

2
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.010
So descriptive data collection,
as you recall,

3
00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:16.700
basically talks about trying to understand
for instance, who are our customers?

4
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.120
What does the?

5
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.910
And all those kinds of question
where you have to have hard numbers.

6
00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:23.220
So how can you do this?

7
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.390
This can possibly be done in two ways.

8
00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.690
One is active data collection, and
one is unobtrusive data collection.

9
00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.110
In the Active Data Collection,
you an start thinking about again,

10
00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.080
two ways broadly of thinking
about data collection.

11
00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.920
One is surveys, which is the mainstay of
market research for many, many companies.

12
00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.713
The other one are self-reports
coming from your customers.

13
00:00:42.713 --> 00:00:43.892
We'll talk about both of the them.

14
00:00:43.892 --> 00:00:46.180
So let's start with surveys.

15
00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.480
Surveys, pretty much used by
every Fortune 500 company.

16
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.270
Regularly used for
gathering customer attitudes.

17
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:54.510
You can think about sentiments.

18
00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.153
You can think about purchase habits.

19
00:00:56.153 --> 00:00:59.705
Many different things
actively gathered by surveys.

20
00:00:59.705 --> 00:01:02.510
And data of course,
can be helped to segment customers.

21
00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.580
Start thinking about
who our customers are.

22
00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.800
Start thinking about,
who do they buy from?

23
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.540
All of those questions that you need to
understand to set your marketing strategy.

24
00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.930
Now, there are many, many companies out
there that can help you do these surveys.

25
00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.480
I'll give you some examples.

26
00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.910
Qualtrics is a very famous company that
helps you conduct free surveys sometimes.

27
00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.240
Another example is Survey Monkey.

28
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.160
Now, both of these companies not only
help you do sometimes free surveys, but

29
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.430
they can also be full service companies.

30
00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.260
So for instance, if you look at the
pricing plan of one of these companies.

31
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.670
They allow you and
they price you differently

32
00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.080
based upon whether you would like
them to find your customers,

33
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.940
you would like them to setup the survey,
analyze the data and give you that data.

34
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.460
So in that sense, when you start
thinking about doing surveys,

35
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.280
there are already companies out there
that can help you reach out to customers,

36
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.120
collect that data, and analyze the data.

37
00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.710
But of course,

38
00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.950
surveys are not the only way in which
you can get information from customers.

39
00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.010
You can actually ask customers, directly,
who self-report some of those surveys.

40
00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.910
So if you look at, for
example, mobile surveys.

41
00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:09.030
That's the next frontier.

42
00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:15.120
And these are basically companies that
are giving these suveys on mobile devices.

43
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.240
Again, some common examples,
Qualtrics is one company that does both.

44
00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.870
It does surveys on the desktop.

45
00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.417
It also does surveys on mobile devices.

46
00:02:23.417 --> 00:02:25.900
Another company, for example, is Mixpanel.

47
00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.540
Again, what's the idea here?

48
00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.310
The idea here is, you want to
basically send surveys to customers

49
00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.540
in the moment of purchase sometimes.

50
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.060
So what do mobile surveys allow you to do?

51
00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.940
They allow you to capture
customers' reactions in-situ

52
00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.610
rather than being retrospective.

53
00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.930
For example, you can actually send
a survey to a mobile device of a customer

54
00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.790
at the time that they're making a purchase
decision rather than one month later.

55
00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.870
So clearly the kind of sentiment,
the feelings that customers might have

56
00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.380
at the time of purchase,
would be better captured,

57
00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.840
rather than making them think about
that purchase one month later.

58
00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.108
The questionnaire can be tailored
based on location and context.

59
00:03:01.108 --> 00:03:04.760
So again,
looking at where the mobile device is.

60
00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.626
Now, the words it tells
you where the customer is.

61
00:03:06.626 --> 00:03:07.998
If the customer is in a mall,

62
00:03:07.998 --> 00:03:10.985
you can ask questions about what
they’re doing in that mall.

63
00:03:10.985 --> 00:03:14.306
If the customer is at a restaurant, you
can ask questions tailored based on that.

64
00:03:14.306 --> 00:03:16.731
So, very tailored surveys can be done.

65
00:03:16.731 --> 00:03:17.668
But what’s the caveat?

66
00:03:17.668 --> 00:03:19.660
You don’t want to overdo it.

67
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.160
Marketers should be very careful,
rather than kind of,

68
00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.318
again, using this leverage
of making a tailored survey.

69
00:03:26.318 --> 00:03:30.240
You don't want to keep sending surveys
again and again to the same customer.

70
00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.210
You quite often see a huge amount
of survey fatigue setting in.

71
00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:37.710
So it's important again, use this power
of mobile surveys but up to a limit.

72
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.167
So now that we've talked about
different ways of conducting surveys,

73
00:03:42.167 --> 00:03:43.718
either mobile surveys and so on.

74
00:03:43.718 --> 00:03:45.099
Let's go into more depth.

75
00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:48.040
What are the kinds of questions
you can ask using surveys?

76
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.400
And what are some dos and don'ts?

77
00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.210
Now, before implementing the survey,
there are two big issues that come forth.

78
00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:57.980
What are the different kinds of questions,
and how do you validate a survey?

79
00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.410
In other words, is it worth
collecting what you're collecting?

80
00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:02.560
Let's go over the first issue.

81
00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.860
What are the different kinds of questions?

82
00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.590
Now, this is in some sense a list
of different kinds of questions.

83
00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.100
Of course, there are many kinds
of questions out there, but

84
00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:11.850
these are the important ones.

85
00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.500
So what I'm going to do in
the next few slides is to go

86
00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.450
over each type of questions, look at
what are the positives and negatives,

87
00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.720
in some sense the pros and cons.

88
00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.410
And then,
kind of talk about best practices.

89
00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.510
So let's start with the first one,
itemized category.

90
00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.220
Here's one example of this.

91
00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.360
How satisfied are you with
your health insurance plan?

92
00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:32.660
It could be different buckets.

93
00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:37.260
In this case, you have five buckets from
very satisfied to very dissatisfied.

94
00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.200
Notice, the extent of category
descriptions are quite clear,

95
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.880
and there is a balance of favorable and
unfavorable categories.

96
00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.100
What does that mean?

97
00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.150
There's a middle point.

98
00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.780
Neither satisfied or dissatisfied.

99
00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.000
On the other hand, you have two
categories which are above that.

100
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.010
Quite satisfied and very satisfied.

101
00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:55.770
And two categories below that.

102
00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.750
Quite dissatisfied and very dissatisfied.

103
00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.673
So on the surface of it, I think this
is very good way of asking a question.

104
00:05:02.673 --> 00:05:04.386
But what are some cons with this?

105
00:05:04.386 --> 00:05:07.892
Well, one big con is, compare to what?

106
00:05:07.892 --> 00:05:12.599
Of course, if the person who's
answering this question does not have

107
00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:16.685
health insurance,
clearly this question is not relevant.

108
00:05:16.685 --> 00:05:20.570
It could be possible that the question
is being answered by a person who is

109
00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.075
thinking about insurance
that he had before.

110
00:05:23.075 --> 00:05:25.360
If that's the reference point,

111
00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.130
the answer that he might be getting
might be quite different across people.

112
00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:30.170
In other words,

113
00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:34.600
the problem with this is you don't know
what people are comparing it against.

114
00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.709
So that's one issue with
the itemized category.

115
00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:41.990
Let's look at another one which
tries to address this issue.

116
00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:46.804
Here, which we would call as a comparative
question, you directly ask compared to

117
00:05:46.804 --> 00:05:51.550
private clinics in the area, the doctors
in private practice provide a quality of

118
00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:55.540
medical care which is very
inferior to very superior.

119
00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:56.980
So what have we done here?

120
00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:59.910
You've tried to address a problem
with the previous set of questions,

121
00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:04.200
which is, you're explicitly telling
people what to compare against.

122
00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:05.260
But what's the problem here?

123
00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.270
What are the big loss of information?

124
00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:11.500
The big loss of information is,
both alternatives might not be that great.

125
00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:15.320
So you're comparing two alternatives
which might be both below the bar.

126
00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.280
But one is better than the other.

127
00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:18.880
So what do we see here?

128
00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:21.200
Depending upon the type
of question you can ask,

129
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.840
there might be some loss of
information that always happens.

130
00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:28.200
So what I want to do again in the next
few slides is to show you different

131
00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.940
kinds of ways you can ask questions which
tries to get at the heart of the problems.

132
00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:34.730
Here's another one.

133
00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:36.870
It's called ranking questions.

134
00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:38.910
An example of this would be the following.

135
00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:41.050
Please rank the following
characteristic of, let's say,

136
00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:43.990
cellphone service in terms
of their importance.

137
00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:46.945
1 to 8, there are 8 categories given.

138
00:06:46.945 --> 00:06:49.597
1 here is the most important,
8 is the least important, and

139
00:06:49.597 --> 00:06:52.512
typically when you're asking
these questions, no ties allowed.

140
00:06:52.512 --> 00:06:56.644
What that means is, only one of these
things could be the most important and

141
00:06:56.644 --> 00:06:59.345
only one of them is the least
important and so on.

142
00:06:59.345 --> 00:07:00.650
So what do we see here?

143
00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:03.270
First of all,
the type of categories are quite clear.

144
00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:07.810
But what it also involves
is a lot of comparisons.

145
00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:11.450
In other words, people would have to do
a lot of comparisons when they're going

146
00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:13.030
across all of this.

147
00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:15.410
So if you look at it,
for the first one, for

148
00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:18.840
the first rank, you're comparing
across eight different categories, and

149
00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:21.430
giving one of those
categories as the top rank.

150
00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:24.460
Let's say reception clarity for
you is the most important one, so

151
00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:26.240
you give it number 1.

152
00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:29.120
Then, when you're going
through giving rank number 2,

153
00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.510
you again have to do seven comparisons.

154
00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:34.060
It's a lot of different comparisons.

155
00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:37.170
What that means is
typically such type of data

156
00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:39.840
might not be very beneficial to collect.

157
00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:44.616
If you have a lot of categories that you
want people to compare, what might end up

158
00:07:44.616 --> 00:07:49.534
happening is that people give the rank 1,
2 and 3, perhaps thinking a lot, and

159
00:07:49.534 --> 00:07:53.495
after that, it might be too many
comparisons for people to make.

160
00:07:53.495 --> 00:07:57.363
So the typical rule of thumb, or the best
practice here, is that you don't give

161
00:07:57.363 --> 00:08:00.797
too many categories, maybe 8 might
actually be already quite a lot.

162
00:08:00.797 --> 00:08:04.370
So maybe 6 to 8 might be a good
number of categories to give.

163
00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:07.790
If you give more than that,
you might get good quality data only for

164
00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:11.580
the top one or two, and after that it
might not be a lot of distinguishing data.

165
00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:17.570
Another example of this is something
called a paired comparison.

166
00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:22.410
In fact, if you think about it, which
we'll cover later on in these sessions,

167
00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:23.900
something called conjoined.

168
00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:28.260
If you think about it, you will see
that this type of comparison data

169
00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.260
is coming actually from
a conjoined type of survey.

170
00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.278
Which of the following two
products do you prefer?

171
00:08:33.278 --> 00:08:36.560
On the left-hand side you have
Honda Accord, price of $18,000,

172
00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:39.800
automatic transmission and
a luxury package.

173
00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:43.921
On the right-hand side you have Toyota
Tercel, $16,000, manual transmission,

174
00:08:43.921 --> 00:08:45.590
standard package.

175
00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:47.140
What are we trying to do here?

176
00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:51.270
What we're trying to do here is forcing
people to compare among the two objects.

177
00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:53.550
And this way,
by looking at what they choose and

178
00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:56.400
what they don't choose,
you try and understand what is it

179
00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:59.440
that people care about when they're
choosing among these two products.

180
00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:04.980
This looks like a great way of
understanding what people like, why?

181
00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:08.790
Because this actually mimics what
people probably do in the real world.

182
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:10.220
Imagine you want a laptop.

183
00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:11.360
What do you typically do?

184
00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.890
You go down, let's say,
to Best Buy or any other store, or

185
00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:17.120
maybe on Amazon,
whatever is your preferred provider.

186
00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:19.660
You go and
start comparing different laptops.

187
00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:22.490
You choose the different things
that you want to compare things on.

188
00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:25.610
So for example, for
a laptop it might be the screen size,

189
00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:28.360
it might be how heavy it is,
what's the CPU, and so on.

190
00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:33.770
So this really mimics what people
really do in perhaps real life.

191
00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:35.740
But what are some issues with this?

192
00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:37.140
Issues are the following.

193
00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:39.700
Again, if you have, let's say,
two comparisons here, two products,

194
00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:44.370
Honda Accord, Toyota Tercel, people
might prefer Honda Accord to Tercel, but

195
00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:45.940
might actually hate both.

196
00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:47.480
Let's say you're given another option.

197
00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:51.820
It might be the case that amongst these
two, Honda Accord is preferable but

198
00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:53.980
it's still below the bar
in terms of what they like.

199
00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:59.580
Another problem of course is,
large number of brands cannot be compared.

200
00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:01.620
Imagine yourself competing among six or

201
00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:05.130
seven different brands with lots
of different kinds of features.

202
00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:07.800
Very, very difficult for
you to make that decision, why?

203
00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:10.560
Because, again,
there'll be lot of comparisons.

204
00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:12.220
What's the best practice here?

205
00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:14.640
Typically, you have about
two to three brands.

206
00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:19.130
So that way you can get good data in
terms of how people are comparing across

207
00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:20.330
different brands.

208
00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:24.910
And also you don't want too many features
or too many attributes of these brands.

209
00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:27.590
Typically about six is
a good number to have.

210
00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:31.213
In this example, we have four which
is the brand name, the price,

211
00:10:31.213 --> 00:10:34.810
what kind of transmission is it and
what kind of package is it.

212
00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:37.820
So about four to six
features per brand and

213
00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:40.800
about two to three brands
in terms of comparison.

214
00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:44.510
Anything more than that, I think it'll
become very difficult for respondents

215
00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:48.519
to clearly understand what the differences
are and give you good reliable data.

216
00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:53.880
The next one is the one which
is the most common form.

217
00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:56.260
What's the story here?

218
00:10:56.260 --> 00:11:00.190
The idea here is you have many statements,
typically on the horizontal.

219
00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:01.310
Which is here you see for

220
00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:05.690
the first one might be I buy many
things with a credit card, and so on.

221
00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:08.800
And in each row you answer
whether you agree or

222
00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:11.810
disagree with these kinds of statements.

223
00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:15.470
So this gives you an ability
to collect a lot of data

224
00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:18.590
in terms of what people like and
what people don't like.

225
00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:22.352
This is called the Likert Scale, it's
the most common form of questioning and

226
00:11:22.352 --> 00:11:26.000
is used very frequently when you want
people to think about lots of different

227
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.260
statements, in this case about
credit cards, and related ideas.

228
00:11:32.456 --> 00:11:36.490
Here's another example,
something called the Continuous Scale.

229
00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:41.065
The idea here is if you have, for example,
some things that you want to show people

230
00:11:41.065 --> 00:11:44.160
and you want what is called
in-situ preferences.

231
00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:47.378
What that means is you want preferences
as they are thinking about or

232
00:11:47.378 --> 00:11:50.659
looking at a particular, let's say,
video or movie clip and so on.

233
00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:53.080
What do people do?

234
00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:57.190
Typically it's a bar, in some sense it
can done on the internet very easily,

235
00:11:57.190 --> 00:12:00.030
very popular with computer
mediated surveys.

236
00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:03.170
You can have a bar,
a mouse click and so on and

237
00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:06.430
people, as they are watching a video or
as they are watching an advertisement and

238
00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:11.050
so on, they can move this bar between do
they like this or do they not like this.

239
00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:14.520
So this is very popular,
especially in computer mediated surveys.

240
00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:18.900
When you want information, or how
people are looking at your product, and

241
00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:23.450
how that preference changes as they're
going through the different products.

242
00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:25.410
So if they're looking
at a particular video.

243
00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:28.920
Let's say you're an ad provider and you
want to see how people's preference for

244
00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:32.310
that ad changes as they're viewing the ad.

245
00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:35.150
So while they're viewing this,
you can keep changing that counter.

246
00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:39.850
Many of us might see this more
recently in election polls.

247
00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:43.050
So what happens during elections is
when they're having debates and so on,

248
00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:47.070
they typically have an audience which has
this meter which can go back and forth.

249
00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:49.710
So as they're going through an argument,
you can kind of see

250
00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:53.190
how people are preferring towards one or
the other candidate.

251
00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:55.010
So this is what is called
as a continuous scheme.

252
00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:00.470
Now, what I wanted to do here
was basically give you a broad

253
00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:03.160
overview of the different
kinds of questions.

254
00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.120
Notice these are not an exhaustive set.

255
00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:07.852
There are many other kinds of
questions that are out there.

256
00:13:07.852 --> 00:13:12.223
But what I wanted to take away from all of
this is that each type of question that

257
00:13:12.223 --> 00:13:17.001
you ask, whether it's a rating scale, is
it a comparative scale, Likert Scale and

258
00:13:17.001 --> 00:13:20.325
so on, each one of those
questions has some pros and cons.

259
00:13:20.325 --> 00:13:24.997
So thinking carefully about what kind of
question to ask depends upon what the end

260
00:13:24.997 --> 00:13:26.490
goal is.

261
00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:28.340
That brings me to issue number two.

262
00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:29.780
What is the end goal here?

263
00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:33.556
The end goal can be of two forms,
one is called validity and

264
00:13:33.556 --> 00:13:34.471
one is called reliability.

265
00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:39.660
In other words, is what you're collecting
going to be worth anything at all?

266
00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:40.680
So lets take that issue.

267
00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:46.500
Validity, basically the idea
is of predictive validity.

268
00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:50.668
So for instance, let's say you're asking a
net promoter score which is something that

269
00:13:50.668 --> 00:13:52.708
I'll talk about in the next slide itself.

270
00:13:52.708 --> 00:13:57.344
Net promoter score typically is one where
you measure customer satisfaction, okay?

271
00:13:57.344 --> 00:14:00.385
And you're trying to see whether
people are going to refer your product

272
00:14:00.385 --> 00:14:01.180
to other people.

273
00:14:02.368 --> 00:14:06.688
Now, what you'd like to hope for is that
net promoter score typically predicts for

274
00:14:06.688 --> 00:14:09.094
example, customer profits, firm profits or

275
00:14:09.094 --> 00:14:12.689
other kinds of different variables
that you might be interested in.

276
00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:17.610
If it does, then what you would say
is that that particular survey,

277
00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:20.270
net promoter score,
has good predictive validity.

278
00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:24.430
What that predictive validity
means is that it's worthwhile

279
00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:27.080
collecting that survey
data because it predicts

280
00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:31.220
a particular type of deeper variable
that you as a firm are interested in.

281
00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:34.029
It could be profit, stock prices,
other kinds of behavior.

282
00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:40.000
Another way to look at how good
surveys are is using the reliability.

283
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.980
One specific form of reliability is
called test, retest reliability.

284
00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:45.430
What that means is very simple.

285
00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:49.790
It basically says how stable is it,
that what you're collecting.

286
00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:52.880
If you were to remeasure for example,
customer satisfaction and so

287
00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:54.219
on, does it vary a lot?

288
00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:58.590
If it does, from one time we
measure it to the next time,

289
00:14:58.590 --> 00:15:01.800
what it tells you is perhaps
it's not a very stable measure.

290
00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:02.890
It has a lot of volatility.

291
00:15:03.945 --> 00:15:07.630
Ideally what you would like to do
is to have a measure or a scale or

292
00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:10.800
a way of measuring things,
which are reasonably stable.

293
00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:14.110
So that you take comfort in
the fact that once you measure it,

294
00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:15.769
it's not going to change very volatile.

295
00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:22.600
So those are two ways in which you can
measure how good a survey is, validity and

296
00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:23.120
reliability.

297
00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:27.600
So in the next few slides, we're going to
take a concrete example of a survey,

298
00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:32.450
the net promoter score, see what are the
dos and don'ts of survey design as well.

299
00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:35.390
But before I do that, I just want
to summarize what are the pros and

300
00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:36.890
cons of surveys.

301
00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:38.540
Let's first look at the pros.

302
00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:42.310
Low cost, relatively easy to implement,

303
00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:45.150
good way to learn about
potential customers.

304
00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:49.290
On the cons, not very easy to
write a survey that's non-biased.

305
00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:50.250
And we'll bring that up.

306
00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:52.720
We will talk about the best practices.

307
00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:55.730
The second big issue is how do
you get the right respondents?

308
00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:57.820
Who are the people that
should answer the survey?

309
00:15:57.820 --> 00:16:00.970
Again, something I'll bring up when
we talk about the dos and don'ts.

310
00:16:00.970 --> 00:16:03.500
And what about products
that requires some use?

311
00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:06.110
So there, surveys might not
be the best way to do, why?

312
00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:09.430
Because these are products that actually
requires customers to use the product.

313
00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:12.340
So in that case, what will the people do?

314
00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:15.100
Typically you might do, for
example, a focus group,

315
00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:18.450
where you ask people to first look
at the prototype, touch the product,

316
00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:21.750
feel the product, use the product, and
then perhaps do a survey after that.

317
00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:25.020
So these are the big pros and
cons of surveys.

318
00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:27.678
When you think about implementing
some surveys, keep these in mind.
