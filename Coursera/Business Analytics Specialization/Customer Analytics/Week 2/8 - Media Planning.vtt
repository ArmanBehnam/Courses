1
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.800
So now from point of sales data
let's go to media planning.

2
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.860
Now, I want to give you examples
of how companies can go ahead and

3
00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.300
collect some data,
sometimes themselves and

4
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:19.050
sometimes by the aid of other companies
to get a sense of audience engagement.

5
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.000
So in radio, for example,

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.810
there are companies out there that
can collect this type of data.

7
00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.370
So Kantar Media, for instance,

8
00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:28.730
collects a lot of data, in terms of who's
listening to different radio shows,

9
00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.000
how is the popularity of
different stations, and so on.

10
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.920
There are other companies as well that
collect this type of data, for example,

11
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.140
Nielsen Audio.

12
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.110
Again, many companies nowadays
try to get a sense of

13
00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.960
audience engagement at the radio stations.

14
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.190
You can think about these kinds of
engagement even at the TV level.

15
00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.418
So here, you'll soon collect a lot
of data which is from the TV level.

16
00:00:49.418 --> 00:00:50.451
How will they do that?

17
00:00:50.451 --> 00:00:52.025
With a setup box.

18
00:00:52.025 --> 00:00:55.120
So this is the box which is would
go along with your cable box.

19
00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.210
What are they trying to do here?

20
00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.050
They're trying to basically record who are
the people who are watching a particular

21
00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.360
TV station, who is it in the family,
and then the aggregate

22
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.220
at different households to get a sense
of how popular is a particular TV show,

23
00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.200
how popular different channels, and so on.

24
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.700
So again, Nielsen is not
the only company doing this.

25
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.950
There are many other companies as well,
and

26
00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.940
other companies following their example.

27
00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.210
Again, Grand Track is a company that
basically collects information,

28
00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.020
again about TV engagement.

29
00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.430
There's slightly different
ways of doing it,

30
00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.880
but the overall idea is exactly the same.

31
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.100
What would we want to do in these
kind of issues, TV or radio?

32
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.609
Get a sense of how popular is a particular
show or a particular channel.

33
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.540
What are the kinds of
questions that can be answered

34
00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.690
with these kinds of data that's available?

35
00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.460
So for example, who's watching what show?

36
00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:44.970
As a brand manager, or

37
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.080
in fact as a TV station manager, we would
like to know which shows are popular?

38
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.090
Which shows potentially
can be funded next year?

39
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.759
How is the viewership
pattern changing over time?

40
00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.290
And for example, if you start thinking
about viewership pattern, how should I be

41
00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.120
spending different kinds of money on
different types of ads in these TV shows?

42
00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.600
So broadly, these kinds of questions can
be answered by getting information about

43
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.056
audience engagement and
that's what companies like Nielsen,

44
00:02:12.056 --> 00:02:15.512
companies like Kantar Media,
that's what they're doing when

45
00:02:15.512 --> 00:02:19.742
they collecting different types of data
either to radio shows or for TV shows.

46
00:02:19.742 --> 00:02:22.193
So now we'll talk about
social media analytics.

47
00:02:22.193 --> 00:02:24.940
So social media is becoming
extremely popular.

48
00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.510
There are many,
many people on Facebook, Twitter.

49
00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.450
You name the different formats,
people are there talking about brands,

50
00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.480
talking to each other, and so on.

51
00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.860
So clearly, when you think about
it yourself as a brand manager,

52
00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.508
you start thinking about what
are customers talking about?

53
00:02:38.508 --> 00:02:40.390
You need data about social media,

54
00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.040
and there are companies out there
that'll help you get that data.

55
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.439
For example, Hootsuite is a company
that does a lot of information and

56
00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:50.331
data collection on things going
on on Facebook or Twitter.

57
00:02:50.331 --> 00:02:52.590
So it's a platform that
collects some data.

58
00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.730
Sprout Social is another example.

59
00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.540
So there are many companies out there
that are collecting information on

60
00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.110
what customers are saying and
doing on social media.

61
00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.640
So what are the kinds of questions
that can manager can answer

62
00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.280
using this type of data?

63
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.993
The first one is its audience engagement.

64
00:03:07.993 --> 00:03:12.480
If I'm running a campaign on Facebook,
if I'm running a campaign on Twitter,

65
00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.190
how many people are responding?

66
00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.370
That gives me a sense on
how good that campaign is.

67
00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.120
Another example might be more along the
lines of thinking about brand mentions.

68
00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.340
Is our branding mentioned more
times than our competitors?

69
00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.070
What's our share of voice?

70
00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.950
So for example, as we just saw,
we could track for

71
00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.950
instance how many times Wharton came
up in the last month on Twitter.

72
00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.340
You can start doing the search for

73
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.110
your own brand and
see how it compares to your competitors.

74
00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.420
You can also start thinking
of doing sentiment analysis.

75
00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.910
So it's not just about mentions,
or how is it being mentioned.

76
00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:47.960
Is it being mentioned in a positive way?

77
00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.730
Is it being mentioned in a negative way?

78
00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.240
How is it being mentioned?

79
00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.070
And then you can start
thinking about linking for

80
00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:58.410
instance, what might be going on in the
economy, all different kinds of issues,

81
00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.290
together with brand mentions to see
how they might change over time.

82
00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.340
So social media data is very,
very powerful.

83
00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.860
There are companies out there that can
help you collect this type of data to see

84
00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.440
how your company's trending on social
media as compared to your competitors.

85
00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.220
So now,
we'll talk about another type of data.

86
00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.730
This is broadly categorized as web data.

87
00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:21.300
This would be basically all the different
kind of searches that you're doing on

88
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:25.240
the internet, all the different websites
that people might be visiting, and so on.

89
00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.230
Of course,
there's a wealth of information out there.

90
00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:30.180
First is, you can start looking
at your own company's website and

91
00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.280
seeing what customers are looking at.

92
00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.750
But at the same time, you also want to
know what's happening in the market place,

93
00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.348
and that's where these
other companies come in.

94
00:04:37.348 --> 00:04:41.315
For example, compete.com is
a website that allow you to look at

95
00:04:41.315 --> 00:04:43.645
what people are looking
at different website.

96
00:04:43.645 --> 00:04:46.475
There are of course, many other
companies that do the same thing.

97
00:04:46.475 --> 00:04:51.005
For instance, Homescore is another company
that collects this type of data as well.

98
00:04:51.005 --> 00:04:52.685
So are many other companies.

99
00:04:52.685 --> 00:04:55.625
So this is another example and
lots of other company that

100
00:04:55.625 --> 00:04:58.515
basically collect information on
what are people searching for,

101
00:04:58.515 --> 00:05:00.960
which websites they're visiting,
and so on.

102
00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.700
What does a data stream look like?

103
00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:07.040
Again, I went to compete.com and
looked for the type of searches and

104
00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.540
the type of people who are coming
in on the Wharton website.

105
00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.370
That's what it looks
like in the last month.

106
00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.460
So it gives you information, for
instance, on unique visitors and so on.

107
00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.350
So besides, of course, going out and
looking at a company that collect

108
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:22.940
a wealth of information,
you can have data from your own website.

109
00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:27.270
For instance, as an example, Etsy.com
is a company where you can get a lot of

110
00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.320
information, for instance,
on what are people looking at.

111
00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.720
So Etsy has this data, they can look
at what people are searching for and

112
00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.770
get a sense of what products are becoming
popular, what websites, for example,

113
00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:39.984
are becoming popular, and so on.

114
00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.820
So electively,
web data gives you a lot of information

115
00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.810
in terms of what your
customers are looking at.

116
00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:51.300
Either on your own website or
competitors website and so on.

117
00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.920
Broadly, this type of
data helps you answer

118
00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.730
questions which are very
managerially oriented.

119
00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:59.250
You can stop thinking about
any kind of campaign.

120
00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:02.330
You can broadly categorize the type of
spending that you're doing in terms of

121
00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.550
earned media, paid media, and owned media.

122
00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:08.160
Owned media basically is your own website.

123
00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.200
Paid media is any kind of engagement
that you're doing in terms of

124
00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.390
aim for that media.

125
00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:14.800
And earned media are people who
are organically coming to you.

126
00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:19.140
If you start thinking about collecting
this type of web data, it gives you

127
00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:23.100
a sense of what are the other for
many kind of campaigns that you're doing.

128
00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:24.728
So again, the type of data and

129
00:06:24.728 --> 00:06:28.583
the type of questions you're trying
to answer have to go hand in hand.

130
00:06:30.527 --> 00:06:33.587
Finally, of course, when you start
thinking about the Holy Grail,

131
00:06:33.587 --> 00:06:35.070
it's mobile data.

132
00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:38.050
That's where many,
many companies are making inroads.

133
00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:39.480
Think about Facebook.

134
00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.810
Of course,
it started it off as a desktop, but

135
00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:45.730
many more people are accessing
Facebook using their mobile phones.

136
00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:47.230
Facebook has this data.

137
00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:49.480
They know where people
are accessing Facebook and

138
00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:50.990
they know the location as well.

139
00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:52.850
That's a wealth of information.

140
00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:55.210
As another example, there's Foursquare.

141
00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:58.850
Again, this is a website in
which people can check in,

142
00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:00.690
usually through their mobile phone.

143
00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:03.660
Foursquare again has a lot of
information on where people are,

144
00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:06.110
where they're checking in,
what else is around them.

145
00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:09.180
So many, many such company are basically
collecting this information.

146
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:13.570
On the flip side, there are company
such as Flurry Analytics.

147
00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:14.830
What do they do?

148
00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:16.610
They get a sense of, hey,

149
00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:20.120
how's your app doing in terms
of over all customer engagement.

150
00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:23.783
And they can also start helping you
monetize the app and make it better,

151
00:07:23.783 --> 00:07:28.012
in terms of people accessing it easily and
trying to make more money out of the app.

152
00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.970
What are the type of managerial
questions that can be answered?

153
00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:33.630
For example,

154
00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:36.470
is customer search on the mobile
platform different from the desktop?

155
00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:40.520
What information to show
customers based on their location?

156
00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:42.710
So think about Four Square for instance.

157
00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:44.980
They have information on where you are.

158
00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:48.570
Should the information they show you be
different depending upon your location?

159
00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:50.070
Probably yes.

160
00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:52.430
And of course,
another type of question could be,

161
00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:54.990
are the coupons that can be
sent based on your location?

162
00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:59.890
All of these questions can be answered
by looking at mobile data, and again,

163
00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:03.190
there are companies out there that
can help you collect these data.

164
00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:06.080
So we just covered a lot
about how media industries,

165
00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.820
companies in the media world track
what are the customers are doing.

166
00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:12.500
So, should we care about all of these
questions if you let see you're not in

167
00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:13.680
the media world?

168
00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.510
My answer to you is, absolutely.

169
00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:16.200
Why?

170
00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:17.730
Because this is the way of thinking.

171
00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:19.467
Again, it’s a customer centric approach.

172
00:08:19.467 --> 00:08:22.160
So if you think about the kinds
of questions that media companies

173
00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:25.430
are interested in, they are interested
in who are their customers?

174
00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:26.500
What are they watching?

175
00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:27.940
What else are they watching?

176
00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:31.320
What programs for
example are cannibalizing each other?

177
00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:34.870
These are questions which are relevant
no matter which industry you're in.

178
00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:38.520
In terms of thinking about it
from a customers perspective.

179
00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:40.590
Let's say on the credit card business.

180
00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:43.380
They are two big giants there,
MasterCard and Visa.

181
00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:45.760
If Lexi got into the MasterCard business,
well,

182
00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:48.570
you could want to know
who your customers are.

183
00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:50.110
What else are they using?

184
00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:53.060
When are they using a Visa
card versus a MasterCard?

185
00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:56.360
Is your business being
cannibalized sometimes by Visa?

186
00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:59.990
Again, these are questions which
cut across the type of industries.

187
00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:01.910
What is the common theme around them?

188
00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:03.720
Being customer-oriented.

189
00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:08.341
So taking good data from customers, trying
to gather as much clean data as possible,

190
00:09:08.341 --> 00:09:11.101
I think it's a valuable
input when you start making

191
00:09:11.101 --> 00:09:12.973
critical managerial decisions.
