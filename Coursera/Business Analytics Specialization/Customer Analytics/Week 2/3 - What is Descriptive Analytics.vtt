00:00:04.227 --> 00:00:07.580
Welcome to Customer Analytics,
I'm Professor Raghu Iyengar.

2
00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.554
I'm a professor of marketing in
the Wharton marketing department,

3
00:00:10.554 --> 00:00:12.358
I've been here for about ten years or so.

4
00:00:12.358 --> 00:00:14.772
And during this time I've
taught marketing research and

5
00:00:14.772 --> 00:00:17.180
other customer analytics related courses.

6
00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.311
So, today we talk about
descriptive analytics,

7
00:00:19.311 --> 00:00:22.163
I hope your as excited as I am to
talk about descriptive analytics.

8
00:00:22.163 --> 00:00:26.428
So, these days a lot of collection and
analysis of big data is outsourced to

9
00:00:26.428 --> 00:00:29.840
third party companies who
specialized these things.

10
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.035
And throughout this module I'll introduce
you to companies that do this kind of work

11
00:00:33.035 --> 00:00:35.040
in different industry segments.

12
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.446
Such as scanner data at grocery stores,
or metric for

13
00:00:37.446 --> 00:00:40.560
measuring audience engagement
by media companies.

14
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.960
But even if you're not involved
in these industries, or

15
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.860
you want to engage in descriptive
data analytics on a smaller scale,

16
00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.122
it's very important to know
about these companies.

17
00:00:48.122 --> 00:00:50.236
The way in which they're
collecting this data, and

18
00:00:50.236 --> 00:00:53.300
the kinds of the questions that
the data is trying to explore.

19
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.090
Why is this?

20
00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.650
This is because it's a way of
thinking about these kinds of issues.

21
00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.070
Thus, by learning about these companies,
you will take away actionable techniques

22
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.060
in thinking and forming questions, about
descriptive data, techniques that you can

23
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.560
employ in whatever descriptive data
environment you are attempting to analyze.

24
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.330
So what is descriptive analytics?

25
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.406
Descriptive analytics can be
defined in a variety of ways.

26
00:01:14.406 --> 00:01:19.278
So one is that descriptive analytics is
a way of linking the market to the firm

27
00:01:19.278 --> 00:01:21.420
through decisions.

28
00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.190
Another way of thinking
about descriptive analytics,

29
00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.970
it's the information that's needed
to make actionable decisions.

30
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.203
And yet another way is, it's principle for
systematically collecting and

31
00:01:31.203 --> 00:01:32.405
interpreting data.

32
00:01:32.405 --> 00:01:35.050
What's the common thread here?

33
00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:36.894
The common thread is getting good data.

34
00:01:36.894 --> 00:01:41.404
But what I also want to talk about is
that it's the synergy between data and

35
00:01:41.404 --> 00:01:45.650
decisions that managers have to
make that makes for good analytics.

36
00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.880
So what are the different kinds
of decisions that managers

37
00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:49.470
might have to make?

38
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.879
One set of decisions might be
purely exploratory in nature.

39
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.540
So think about a brand manager,
they're looking at their brand sales and

40
00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.350
suddenly they start dropping.

41
00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.250
Question is why are they dropping?

42
00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.030
Is it because customer
preferences have changed?

43
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.320
Is it because customers like competitors?

44
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.650
There could be a variety
of things going on.

45
00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:13.610
So in that sense, at this stage
is purely exploratory in nature,

46
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.980
we're trying to understand why things are
not working out the way we expect them to.

47
00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.200
Another set of questions can
be purely descriptive, for

48
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.300
example again going back
to the brand manager.

49
00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.722
I want to know what's my
customer share of wallet?

50
00:02:25.722 --> 00:02:26.680
How much are they spending with me?

51
00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.570
How much are they spending
with my competitors?

52
00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:31.740
Who are our customers?

53
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.630
What's our segmentation like?

54
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.280
So these kinds of questions require hard
data in terms of understanding how much

55
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.450
customers are, for example, buying our
products or other competitor's products.

56
00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.990
Yet another set of questions
can be purely causal.

57
00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:52.060
And the idea here is for example, if I'm
changing the landing page on my website,

58
00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.030
how will it change consumer behavior?

59
00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.430
Would a change, would it in increase
it in terms of click through rate,

60
00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:57.600
would it bring it down, and so on.

61
00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.561
So these questions, the one on the right
most extreme, the causal questions,

62
00:03:02.561 --> 00:03:05.080
require systematic data collection and

63
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.050
careful thought in terms
of how to collect data.

64
00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.480
So what we see here is going
from left to the right,

65
00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.290
the type of data that
needs to be collected,

66
00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:20.010
the type of conditions that the data needs
to be collected under also keep changing.

67
00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.240
So as we go on in this module today,

68
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.330
we'll talk about different kinds of
questions that manager need to answer, and

69
00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.170
what type of data is best suited
to answer those questions.

70
00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.643
So let's begin with the exploratory
type of data collection.

71
00:03:32.643 --> 00:03:37.359
So exploratory type of data collection
is typically done to develop

72
00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:40.040
initial hunches or insights.

73
00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.570
Again recall the example
that we started out with,

74
00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.120
the brand manager thinking about
why the sales are dropping.

75
00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.168
It could be a variety
of different reasons.

76
00:03:47.168 --> 00:03:51.757
And usually this type of data collection
is a first step and very important step,

77
00:03:51.757 --> 00:03:55.819
to get a broad understanding of what
the underlying problems could be.

78
00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.260
And it provides broad guidelines on what
you should look for more rigorously.

79
00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.160
What's a typical technique that
comes to mind when you start

80
00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.370
thinking about exploratory
data collection?

81
00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.160
It's focus groups.

82
00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.683
Focus groups have been there for
a long time.

83
00:04:09.683 --> 00:04:11.780
What's a focus group?

84
00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.460
Basically, you have about 8
to 10 customers in a room,

85
00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:19.490
usually you have moderator who designs
the overall flow of the focus group.

86
00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:22.004
And you want these people to come and
talk about the brand,

87
00:04:22.004 --> 00:04:23.555
their sentiments about the brand.

88
00:04:23.555 --> 00:04:27.953
Perhaps feed off each other,
in other words you can observe dynamics,

89
00:04:27.953 --> 00:04:32.900
it's reasonably unstructured,
it's free flow conversation.

90
00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.168
And what are you trying
to do as a brand manager?

91
00:04:34.168 --> 00:04:38.740
Get insights into what might be
some pinpoints for consumers.

92
00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.785
Now, in this day and
age of data analytics and big data,

93
00:04:42.785 --> 00:04:47.920
focus groups have morphed,
in some sense, to many different ways.

94
00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.280
Market research online communities, or

95
00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.200
internet communities,
are basically focus groups on steroids.

96
00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.770
You can think about variety of different
companies offering this service, for

97
00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.520
instance, Focal Point.

98
00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.838
What Focal Point does is basically
rather than looking at 10 to 20 people,

99
00:05:03.838 --> 00:05:07.376
you start thinking about 100 to 200,
or sometimes 500 people in a group.

100
00:05:07.376 --> 00:05:10.412
And you're monitoring them not for
one time, but

101
00:05:10.412 --> 00:05:13.390
over a period of six months to a year.

102
00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.928
What's the idea here?

103
00:05:13.928 --> 00:05:17.738
The idea here is to build
relationship with your consumers.

104
00:05:17.738 --> 00:05:24.320
Over time these 100 to 200 people, start
building relationships with each other.

105
00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.130
They become more and more comfortable
talking about their real feelings and

106
00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:28.640
real insights.

107
00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.090
Focal Point of course is not the only
company doing it, there are many,

108
00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:34.290
many other companies.

109
00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:40.010
For instance, C Space is one of them and
many other competitors as well, okay?

110
00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:43.050
There are many advantages
of internet communities,

111
00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.380
one is that it enhances
engagement with customers.

112
00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:50.780
So these customers are together, talking
to each other, talking to the brand for

113
00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.520
about six months to a year.

114
00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.710
So clearly this closed concentration
in terms of talking to each other,

115
00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:59.410
communication with the brand,
it really enhances their engagement.

116
00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:00.883
Second, shorter deadlines are possible.

117
00:06:00.883 --> 00:06:04.803
Typically with focus group there are
logistical issues in terms of trying to

118
00:06:04.803 --> 00:06:08.570
get these people in the room,
get a moderator, and so on.

119
00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:10.230
Because you are looking
at these customers for

120
00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:13.153
about six months to a year, you can
actually have much shorter deadline.

121
00:06:13.153 --> 00:06:16.230
There are aha moments that come out,

122
00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:19.080
the most famous example is
Kraft's 100 calorie pack.

123
00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:21.210
What did they do?

124
00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:24.460
They basically had a community,
they had worked with C Space.

125
00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:27.361
They had a community that started looking
at what do people want in snacks?

126
00:06:27.361 --> 00:06:29.389
What was the insight?

127
00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:32.029
It's not that people wanted
to stop eating snacks,

128
00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:34.799
what they really wanted was
snacks with low calories.

129
00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:40.015
Nabisco's 100 calorie pack
has been an amazing success.

130
00:06:40.015 --> 00:06:42.901
There are caveats as well,
what's the big caveat?

131
00:06:42.901 --> 00:06:45.640
ROI can be very hard to determine.

132
00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:46.340
Why?

133
00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:50.378
Because as you start engaging with an
internet community, early on it might be

134
00:06:50.378 --> 00:06:53.890
quite difficult to forecast,
what kind of insights will come out.

135
00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:58.900
For Kraft, this was great, but it will not
be the case for every possible example.

136
00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:02.660
So, thinking carefully about when
you might want internet communities,

137
00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:06.460
thinking carefully about is it worth
the investment of six months to a year?

138
00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:09.531
Very important to determine as you
start going into the idea of collecting

139
00:07:09.531 --> 00:07:11.870
data from customers,
over an extended period of time.
