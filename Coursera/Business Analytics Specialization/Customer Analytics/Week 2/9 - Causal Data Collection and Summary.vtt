00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.340
So, so

2
00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.540
far we've talked about
Exploratory data collection.

3
00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.060
We've talked about
Descriptive data collection.

4
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.570
Next, we want to move on
to Causal data collection.

5
00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.120
As you notice, this type of data
collection is more stringent.

6
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.830
Let me give you an example.

7
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.880
Many times when you're
thinking about our websites,

8
00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.240
of our companies,
you think about the landing pages.

9
00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.480
Think about is landing page A,
better than landing page B?

10
00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.950
How do we determine that?

11
00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:26.440
That's where you might want
to do a field experiment.

12
00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.260
Some set of customers see landing page A.

13
00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.800
Another set of customers
see landing page B.

14
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.850
We look at the click through rates, and
then decide which landing page is better.

15
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.630
In other words,
we are trying to make causal link between

16
00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.340
changing the landing page, and
looking at the click through rate.

17
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.130
That's what causality is all about and

18
00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.310
that's what field
experiments are all about.

19
00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:49.030
So there are many companies that allow
you to do this type of A B testing.

20
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.060
For example,
we start thinking about A B testing

21
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.270
you need to start distinguishing
between correlation and causation.

22
00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.670
Correlation is the relationship
between two variables.

23
00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:01.880
So let's take price and sales.

24
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.980
Are sales and
prices correlated, probably so.

25
00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.370
If prices go down,
sales might drop as well.

26
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.580
Causation is one variable
producing an effect in the other.

27
00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.410
Correlation and
causation are not the same thing.

28
00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.380
Let's take some concrete
examples to try and

29
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.240
understand the difference between
correlation and causation.

30
00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.020
For us correlation and

31
00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.240
causation there are three requirements if
you start thinking about causal inference.

32
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.360
First of all is there
a correlation at all?

33
00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.190
That's basically evidence of
association between X and Y.

34
00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:41.330
Let's say X is price, Y is sales,
is there a relationship between them?

35
00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.750
But that's not enough for causation.

36
00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.760
There are two other requirements as well.

37
00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.430
One is temporal antecedents,
X must happen before Y.

38
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.940
So if you want to say price changes drives
sales, we need to be able to say that

39
00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.550
price changes are good before
sales changes happened.

40
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.550
And finally there is no third factor
driving both of them, In other words,

41
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.900
you need to control for
other possible factors.

42
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.650
So let's take an example to try and
understand the relationship

43
00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:10.590
between the two and
what's the difference between the two.

44
00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.780
So there's a popular story that storks,
for example, bring babies.

45
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.910
It typically started in the colder
countries where they used to see, for

46
00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.880
example, a bunch of storks going through,
and suddenly landing on a house, and

47
00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.880
you know a few months later
you see a baby in the house.

48
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.180
Well, are storks really bringing babies?

49
00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.250
Well let's try to understand each
of the different elements and

50
00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.880
see whether there is causation
going on at all, okay?

51
00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.950
If you start thinking about correlation,

52
00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.450
well there might be some
kind of correlation.

53
00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.760
You see houses on which
storks are sitting.

54
00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:41.970
You see babies in that house.

55
00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:42.970
Are they related?

56
00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.040
They are related.

57
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.550
But is it causation?

58
00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:46.940
That's the key question.

59
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.960
For the one hand, there is correlation.

60
00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.390
Storks and babies in the same house.

61
00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.090
Is there temporal antecedent?

62
00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.290
That's true as well.

63
00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.480
Storks come in,
babies come in a little bit later.

64
00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.060
But is there a third factor driving both?

65
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.040
And that's where, for example, causation
and correlation comes in differently.

66
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:08.690
What's the key question?

67
00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.870
Typically we start thinking about why our
storks sitting at a particular house.

68
00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.680
Typically the answer might be,
and this is in colder countries,

69
00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.350
typically the answer might be
because those houses are warmer.

70
00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.460
Then you start thinking about
why are those houses warmer?

71
00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.580
Typically those houses might be warmer
because they have pregnant women in them.

72
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.340
in other words, there is a third factor.

73
00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.780
Houses being reasonable warm that
means the stork is coming and

74
00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.760
sit on top of that house and see a baby
coming a few months later in that house.

75
00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.190
It's about correlation but
definitely not about causation.

76
00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.920
So that's the key difference when
you start thinking about correlation

77
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:44.640
versus causation.

78
00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.470
Now, when you start thinking about
the overall story, you start also thinking

79
00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.080
about many other companies that can
help you distinguish between the two.

80
00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:58.840
The key idea to distinguish between these
two is to start doing field experiments.

81
00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.950
In other words, you start
systematically manipulating prices.

82
00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.800
You start systematically
manipulating landing pages

83
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.990
to see how they might
have a causal impact.

84
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:12.570
So there are many companies out there
that will help you do this AB testing.

85
00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:16.720
So a simple example might be,
if you start thinking about two pages,

86
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.860
landing page A versus landing page B, how
do you distinguish which page is better?

87
00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:24.220
Well, here's what, ideally,
you would like to do.

88
00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.620
One set of customers coming to your
website, will see landing page A.

89
00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.420
Another set of customers, randomly chosen,
will see another landing page,

90
00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.020
landing page B.

91
00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.520
Then over time,
you see the click through rate.

92
00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.020
You see the purchases.

93
00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.260
That can help you determine
which landing page is better.

94
00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.360
This is precisely what many
companies help you do.

95
00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.660
For example Optimizely is one company
that will help you this AB testing,

96
00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.890
it'll help you understand which landing
page is better, in other words, monetize

97
00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:56.390
overall landing pages and figure out which
page you should be showing your customers.

98
00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.480
There are many, many other companies
as well which do the same thing.

99
00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:05.620
Overall, when you look at,
at this particular space, many companies

100
00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.440
are starting to help out other companies
in terms of landing page design,

101
00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.280
in terms of overall optimization of
the webpage, and so on so forth.

102
00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.850
So there are many companies that
help you do mobile AB testing.

103
00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:18.070
What's the idea here?

104
00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:22.340
Basically, on a mobile site, you also want
to answer what landing pages are better,

105
00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:24.610
which icon should be shown, and so on.

106
00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.870
So a company like Optimizely
will help you do that.

107
00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:29.880
And it also has many of the companies
that might do the same thing.

108
00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.330
For example, Leanplum is another
company that does the same thing, and

109
00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:34.970
there are many,
many other competitors as well.

110
00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.430
So when you start thinking about the
pricing plan of these different companies,

111
00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:41.500
the starter plans typically are free.

112
00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.010
So you can do a lot of
A B testing on its own.

113
00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.410
But if you start thinking about
your overall landing pages,

114
00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:49.990
you start thinking about
the overall funnel of purchase,

115
00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:54.610
that's when you start paying the big
money which is the enterprise package.

116
00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.740
What are the kinds of
questions that can help,

117
00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.170
that can be answered
using this type of data?

118
00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:01.790
First one is, website optimization.

119
00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:03.380
What kind of websites?

120
00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.510
What landing pages,
what icons should shown, and so on.

121
00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:08.370
How should they be optimized?

122
00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:10.640
Second, you can start thinking
about mobile app design.

123
00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:14.310
Many companies are coming
out with mobile apps.

124
00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:16.130
How should they be best designed?

125
00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:18.110
And of course,
you can take it to the extreme.

126
00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:21.830
You can start thinking about how should
you design the app in general, but

127
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:24.900
you can also start thinking
about what version to the app

128
00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.710
should be shown to different customers.

129
00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:29.210
The extreme case would
be one to one marketing.

130
00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:34.570
Very broadly, all these companies help you
collect data by doing field experiments.

131
00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:39.380
In other words, you're systematically
manipulating landing pages.

132
00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:43.340
You might be manipulating checkout
pages and so on, so forth to try and

133
00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:47.860
understand how these systematic changes
cause changes in customer behavior.

134
00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:50.460
So what have we done so
far in this module?

135
00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:53.280
We've looked at three different
kinds of data collection,

136
00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:57.210
which go hand in hand with different
types of marketing decisions.

137
00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:59.710
First, we started off with
exploratory data collection,

138
00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:02.970
where we talked about focus groups,
we talked about Internet communities.

139
00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:05.510
Then we went into descriptive
type of data selection.

140
00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:08.530
We talked about surveys,
we talked about point of sales data,

141
00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:12.230
we talked about data related to
media planning and so on, so forth.

142
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:14.410
And then we ended up with
talking about causality.

143
00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:16.590
In other words,
we talked about field experiments and

144
00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:18.620
other company which help
you with field experiments.

145
00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:22.650
So when you start thinking about
the overall summary of this module,

146
00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:23.850
it's about data.

147
00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:26.440
But, more importantly,
it's a synergy between the type of

148
00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:31.110
questions you need to answer, and the type
of data that's best suited to answer it.

149
00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:33.800
It's very,
very important to think about the synergy

150
00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:37.350
as you start thinking about the type
of data you would like to get.

151
00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:40.770
If the question you'd like to answer
is more exploratory in nature,

152
00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:44.030
you do focus groups,
you can do internet communities.

153
00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:47.660
If the type of question you want to answer
is more descriptive, in other words,

154
00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:51.060
you want to get concrete numbers
in terms of share of wallet,

155
00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:54.710
in terms of share of voice,
then the type of data you need to collect

156
00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:57.880
is quite different from
the exploratory type of data.

157
00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:02.690
And finally, if the question that you
need to answer is more causal in nature.

158
00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:05.790
For example, if I changed my landing page,
what would happen?

159
00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:09.150
Then the type of data you need to collect
would be more along the lines of field

160
00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:10.350
experiments.

161
00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:12.770
So it's very important to
keep the managerial goal and

162
00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:15.730
the the type of data collection in mind
because they're highly synergistic.
