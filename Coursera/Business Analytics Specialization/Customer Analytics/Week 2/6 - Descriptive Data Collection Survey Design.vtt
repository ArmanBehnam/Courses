1
00:00:05.465 --> 00:00:09.849
Now what I want to do to kind of conclude
this part of survey design is talk about

2
00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:14.040
some steps in survey design and
some dos and don'ts and best practices.

3
00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:16.490
So let me lay it out there.

4
00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.270
What are the typical
steps that are out there?

5
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.169
And we'll go through each of
these steps in more detail.

6
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.320
I think step 0 which is perhaps
the most important one is to make

7
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.590
sure your result are generalizable
to an appropriate population.

8
00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:30.730
What does that mean?

9
00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.616
What that means is typically when you're
doing a survey, maybe about 1,000 people,

10
00:00:34.616 --> 00:00:38.320
2,000 people, 3,000 people,
whatever the number might be,

11
00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.030
you're obviously interested
in what they have to say.

12
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.170
But what you're more interested
in is how does the thing

13
00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.926
that you're capturing there, for example,

14
00:00:45.926 --> 00:00:51.420
if it's customer satisfaction, how does it
generalize to your entire customer base?

15
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.690
So that's what I mean by step zero.

16
00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.250
And we'll talk a little
bit about how you do that.

17
00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.050
Step 1, develop a detailed listing
of what you want to capture.

18
00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.470
Capture all of these things, write
the draft questions, design the flow and

19
00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:11.370
the layout appropriately, evaluate,
test, retest, pilot test, redraft.

20
00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.570
This is a circular process in
the sense that we first set it up.

21
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.500
We do some pilot testing,
go back to the drawing board,

22
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.450
clean up some questions that come about,
test it again and so

23
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.360
on until you're comfortable going
ahead and implementing that survey.

24
00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.850
Step number 6 perhaps is very important
from implementation point of view.

25
00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.050
Which is, if you're working within your
company or if you're a consultant working

26
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.530
for another company,
get approval from all the parties.

27
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.900
Extremely important, of course, if you're
to implement the survey with customers.

28
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.910
And finally, you go ahead do one more test

29
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.550
in terms of figuring out
whether the survey is good.

30
00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.570
Look at the final copy and
implement the survey.

31
00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.220
So let me go into more detail
about each of these steps.

32
00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.280
As I said,
Step 0 perhaps the most important one.

33
00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.910
It ensures that the data that you're
collecting from the survey will be useful.

34
00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:04.990
Couple of things you ought to think about.

35
00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.830
First, the population has
been defined correctly.

36
00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.940
The sample is representative
of the population.

37
00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.780
So for instance, suppose you're
company that targets let's say,

38
00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.740
25 to 30 year old males.

39
00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.680
What you want to make sure is you
define their population correctly,

40
00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.080
that it's indeed your target market.

41
00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.370
When you say that's your target market,
you look at the sample that you've

42
00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.610
collected for the survey that is
representative of the target market.

43
00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:31.680
Why is that?

44
00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.370
Because then you can be more confident
that the data that you collect from

45
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.496
the survey is indeed representative of
what might happen in your target market.

46
00:02:39.496 --> 00:02:42.464
Then you'll, of course,
ensure that respondents selected to be

47
00:02:42.464 --> 00:02:45.220
interviewed are available,
they understand the question,

48
00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.822
have the appropriate knowledge
to answer the questions.

49
00:02:47.822 --> 00:02:50.484
And you're of course
motivating them in some

50
00:02:50.484 --> 00:02:53.600
incentives to provide
information to the surveys.

51
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.030
And here the biggest issue of
course are response rates.

52
00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.290
You might not be surprised or

53
00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.058
perhaps you are, the typical response
rates in service is about 5%.

54
00:03:03.058 --> 00:03:04.890
So what that means is,

55
00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:10.320
of the 100 people you send out the survey
to, only 5 of them will respond.

56
00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.260
So clearly it's very low.

57
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.630
You should think about appropriate
ways in which you can incentivize

58
00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.160
respondent to in fact
respond to your survey.

59
00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.720
A couple of ways to think about this.

60
00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.300
One is,
how do you handle this non-response?

61
00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:29.990
First, you want to collect data as much
as possible on people who don't respond.

62
00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.830
Why?

63
00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.570
Because you want to make sure
that the people who respond and

64
00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.570
people who don't are not systematically
different from each other.

65
00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.340
If they are,
that might not be a very good way of

66
00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.010
generalizing the results from
your sample of the population.

67
00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:44.930
Let me give you an example.

68
00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.480
If you're interested in capturing
people's responses of prices that you're

69
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.420
charging for your product, and
let's say there's a systematic difference

70
00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.709
between people who respond and people who
don't respond in terms of their income.

71
00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.030
That's clearly not very good
because then what you're capturing

72
00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.520
is not a representation of
the true target market.

73
00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.580
And why is income an important metric?

74
00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:11.040
Because what you're interested is how did
they responded to the price that you pay.

75
00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.000
So clearly income would be
a very important indicator

76
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.489
of how price sensitive people are.

77
00:04:17.615 --> 00:04:21.330
So if there is a difference in income
levels of people who respond and

78
00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:25.580
people who don't, that clearly suggest
that there is a bias in your sample

79
00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.010
in terms of its representativeness
to the population.

80
00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:30.330
What can one do?

81
00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.650
Well, one can follow up
with non-respondents.

82
00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.050
Try to convert them into responding.

83
00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.098
Typically what happens is
you send them reminders.

84
00:04:37.098 --> 00:04:40.505
On the pro side,
you would get people to respond.

85
00:04:40.505 --> 00:04:41.527
What's the con?

86
00:04:41.527 --> 00:04:47.060
The con could be if they are giving
you bad data after repeated requests.

87
00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.550
So, what is typically done?

88
00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.460
You typically compare each wave of
respondent to make sure they are similar.

89
00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.385
For instance,
you might have the first wave.

90
00:04:55.385 --> 00:04:58.070
These are the initial set of responders.

91
00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:00.210
Let's say about 50% of people respond.

92
00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:01.010
You collect that wave one.

93
00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.565
Then after a week or so or two weeks,
you send people reminders.

94
00:05:05.565 --> 00:05:07.365
These are people who have not responded.

95
00:05:07.365 --> 00:05:10.560
Let's say 20% to 30% of them responded.

96
00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.670
Rather than just aggregating or
collecting the data,

97
00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:17.575
you would want to make sure that
the 50% who responded in week

98
00:05:17.575 --> 00:05:22.555
1 are not systematically different
from the 30% who responded in week 3.

99
00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:27.080
If that is the case you can
convert all the data together.

100
00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.124
If that's not the case, I would advise
you to look at the data separately.

101
00:05:34.018 --> 00:05:36.550
Now let's go back to other steps.

102
00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.460
Step 1,
what bits of information to collect?

103
00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:43.320
I think here what you have to make sure is
you translate whatever research objectives

104
00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.360
you have into information requirements.

105
00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:50.680
One way to think about it is thinking
in terms of question relevancy.

106
00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.080
What would you do with
the answer if you knew it?

107
00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.750
So kind of work backwards.

108
00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:59.190
So think about the ideal situation
in which you knew the answer,

109
00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:02.890
then think about how your managerial
decisions would be different.

110
00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:05.030
Once you put that perspective in mind,

111
00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:08.090
it becomes easy to understand how
you should ask those questions.

112
00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.420
Then the question is how do
you format those questions?

113
00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:15.940
There are two big ways
of thinking about that.

114
00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:18.280
One I will recall is
open response questions,

115
00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:19.958
why do you shop Genuardi's for example?

116
00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:22.540
Another is closed response questions.

117
00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:26.770
How often do you shop a Genuardi's,
very often to not at all.

118
00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:27.750
What you notice here,

119
00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:32.600
open response basically ask respondent
to come up with their answers.

120
00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.430
They're not really give
any feedback per se.

121
00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:38.350
On the other hand,
in closed response question,

122
00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:42.550
you typically have a particular question
in mind and you have a skill for example,

123
00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:44.400
from very often not at
all in this question.

124
00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.660
Let's talk a little bit about
what are the advantages and

125
00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:52.500
disadvantages of open-ended and
close-ended questions.

126
00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:56.590
In terms of advantages, there are quite
a few of open-ended questions.

127
00:06:56.590 --> 00:07:00.450
First, respondents can give a general
reaction to questions such as,

128
00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:02.160
why do you say brand X is better?

129
00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:07.200
Responses are given in their own words,
in their own language.

130
00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:08.870
It becomes easier for people to respond.

131
00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:13.060
It can also help interpret
clues in the data.

132
00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:16.320
For example, if people are thinking
about a particular color,

133
00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:19.920
you can follow up to kind of say,
why was that particular color important?

134
00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:24.020
And it might also suggest
what other questions to ask.

135
00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:26.830
Lots of advantages.

136
00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:28.920
At the same time,
there's some drawbacks as well.

137
00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:34.580
First of all, it's not very good for
self-administered surveys.

138
00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:35.180
Why?

139
00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:37.225
Because sometimes,
survey fatigue might come in.

140
00:07:37.225 --> 00:07:40.279
If you think about respondents that
are going through a lot of questions.

141
00:07:40.279 --> 00:07:43.882
You keep asking them open-ended questions,
after a little while,

142
00:07:43.882 --> 00:07:47.400
they might have some fatigue and
they might be not as articulate.

143
00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:50.732
And of course,
all the answers that you get,

144
00:07:50.732 --> 00:07:53.122
depend upon how articulate the person is.

145
00:07:53.122 --> 00:07:57.715
If they're able to understand what they're
thinking about, they're very articulate,

146
00:07:57.715 --> 00:07:59.710
open-ended questions are great.

147
00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:01.030
Why?
Because they're responding

148
00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:03.530
in their own language and
in their own verbage.

149
00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:07.100
If they're not as articulate,
you don't get a lot of information.

150
00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:11.670
And finally in terms of analyzing the
data, post-coding can be quite tedious.

151
00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:14.550
Because it's open end data,
it's their own verbiage, it might

152
00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:17.990
be very difficult to understand all
the different things that one has to code.

153
00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:22.883
So now let's flip back and
kind of talk about closed-ended questions.

154
00:08:22.883 --> 00:08:26.740
Closed-ended questions like I said before,
if you think back to the example how

155
00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:30.760
often do you shop at Genuardi's, the
respondent is provided with predetermined

156
00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:34.070
descriptions and
selects one or more of them.

157
00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:36.470
What are the advantages here, quite clear.

158
00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:39.230
It's easy to use,
it's less threatening for the respondents,

159
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:42.000
it's very simple to code and
much cheaper to administer.

160
00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:45.895
On the flip side,
it requires a lot of pre-testing.

161
00:08:45.895 --> 00:08:49.190
You want to make sure that
the questions you're asking,

162
00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:53.800
the categories that you're giving
people to take or select are clear.

163
00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.380
They understand what it means, and

164
00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:58.060
in fact, it presumes that the list
of responses is complete.

165
00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.769
Lot more effort, but I think in terms
of coding it becomes more easy.

166
00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:07.350
So again when you think about what
type of questions you want to ask,

167
00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:10.060
I think you have to keep
the end goal is mind.

168
00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:13.288
If the end goal is thinking more about
what current consumers are thinking about,

169
00:09:13.288 --> 00:09:15.370
open-ended might be great.

170
00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:19.508
The other hand if the end goal is, you
have a very good set of questions you want

171
00:09:19.508 --> 00:09:23.328
to ask them, you have a good idea of
what responses you're looking at or

172
00:09:23.328 --> 00:09:26.272
what you want to see,
closed-ended might be better.

173
00:09:28.454 --> 00:09:33.187
In terms of best practice, you often do
exploratory research using open-ended

174
00:09:33.187 --> 00:09:38.030
questions and use this for codes in
the quantitative survey with closed-ended.

175
00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:40.960
So this will give you a sense of
how one would design a survey.

176
00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:43.130
Typically, you start with open-ended,

177
00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:45.210
get a sense of all the different
issues that come up.

178
00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:49.030
You get a sense of what
customers are thinking about and

179
00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:51.010
then you design
the closed-ended questions.

180
00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:56.540
Now let's move on to step 3,
drafting the questions.

181
00:09:56.540 --> 00:10:00.470
I think it's very, very important here
to use simple, conventional language.

182
00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:02.750
I'll give you an example
on the next slide.

183
00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:07.410
Avoid ambiguity, be specific as possible,
and don't have long questions.

184
00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:09.920
And start broad and then narrow down.

185
00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:12.870
Keep in mind that when respondents
are answering surveys,

186
00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:14.805
they typically don't have a lot of time.

187
00:10:14.805 --> 00:10:17.597
So if you make it very long,
you ask long questions,

188
00:10:17.597 --> 00:10:21.095
it’s very ambiguous,
you might see a lot of drop outs.

189
00:10:21.095 --> 00:10:24.478
People who starts a survey and
then drop out because of it becoming very,

190
00:10:24.478 --> 00:10:26.425
very tedious to answer those questions.

191
00:10:28.055 --> 00:10:32.195
Here's an example, consider your target
sample and use familiar language.

192
00:10:32.195 --> 00:10:35.550
Did you notice any malfunction
at the time of purchase?

193
00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:38.690
Versus did you notice anything
wrong with it when you bought it?

194
00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:42.430
What you see immediately
is that the latter question

195
00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:46.220
is a little bit more easy to
understand for the general audience.

196
00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:50.370
The first question, did you notice any
malfunctions, uses specific language,

197
00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:54.730
specific verbiage that may be difficult
for the common respondent to answer.

198
00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:57.530
So again, keep your respondent in mind,

199
00:10:57.530 --> 00:11:01.260
understand what they're comfortable with
and design the questions in that sense.

200
00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:05.220
And finally, think about sequencing.

201
00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:08.170
Think about the layout guidelines.

202
00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:10.100
Here are some best practices.

203
00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:12.730
Open the survey with an easy
non-threatening question.

204
00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:15.860
You want people to ease into the survey.

205
00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:19.400
So for instance, if you want
information about their income or

206
00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:23.220
where they live, those might not be
very good questions to start out with.

207
00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:26.930
These are questions that, in fact
ask quite a lot of personal details.

208
00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:31.150
If you do want to ask those questions,
it's probably better to ask them later on,

209
00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:33.510
when they've kind of
eased into the survey.

210
00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:38.225
It should have a smooth and logical flow,
from very general to kind of specific and

211
00:11:38.225 --> 00:11:39.950
there can be a lot of order biases.

212
00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:42.480
I'll give you an example in
the next slide what I mean by it.

213
00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:44.330
A typical common bias is survey fatigue.

214
00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:47.360
Now what's a way around this kind of bias?

215
00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:51.160
Randomized ordering of your
questions as much as possible.

216
00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:52.750
Let me give you an example
of an order bias.

217
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.890
Here are four examples.

218
00:11:55.890 --> 00:12:00.040
What I'm trying to look at here is
what is the percentage of respondents

219
00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:02.850
who said they're very much
interested in buying a new product?

220
00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:04.200
That's what you see on the right column.

221
00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:10.198
In the first row when no questions were
asked before asking that question,

222
00:12:10.198 --> 00:12:12.689
2.8% people were interested
in buying this product.

223
00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:17.290
When you ask people only about
the advantages of the product,

224
00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:22.566
what you see is that that
number jumps up to 16.7%.

225
00:12:22.566 --> 00:12:23.400
Of course,

226
00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:27.210
if you only ask people about disadvantages
of the product, nobody wants to buy it.

227
00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:31.827
And finally when you ask people
about advantages and disadvantages,

228
00:12:31.827 --> 00:12:34.542
it's a number between 2% and
16%, about 5%.

229
00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:37.220
What do we see here?

230
00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:39.400
How we order the questions,

231
00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:44.400
where is it being asked in the overall
survey is extremely important.

232
00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:48.430
So typically, a rule of thumb is if you
think about a question that's important to

233
00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:51.660
you, make sure to randomize its order.

234
00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:54.140
Sometimes some people will
get it in the beginning,

235
00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:57.820
some people might get it towards the end,
some people might get it in the middle.

236
00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:01.460
What you want to see and
make sure is that there is no order bias.

237
00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:03.900
No matter where they get it,
you're getting a similar answer.

238
00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:10.050
So let me conclude with step 5 and 7,
pre-testing and correcting problems.

239
00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:14.620
And keep in mind step 6, if you remember,
was about just making sure that all

240
00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:18.110
the people who are interested in during
the survey, you have a buyout with them.

241
00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:21.678
So it's got little to do with the survey
design per se, but making sure that

242
00:13:21.678 --> 00:13:24.350
everybody who's interested in
doing the survey is on board.

243
00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:27.420
So having said that,
let's go back to Step 5 and 7.

244
00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:32.270
Here the idea is to make sure that before
we implement the survey with your final

245
00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:35.460
target sample, just clean out the survey.

246
00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:38.488
Make sure all the questions
that you do are meaningful.

247
00:13:38.488 --> 00:13:41.190
People who are interested in
answering the the surveys,

248
00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:43.164
they understand what the questions are.

249
00:13:43.164 --> 00:13:45.920
You're designing the questions
with the respondent in mind.

250
00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:49.830
What that means is, you make sure
that you're using verbiage or

251
00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:52.880
language, that the respondent
would be familiar with.

252
00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:56.310
You're asking questions which go
from more general to more specific.

253
00:13:56.310 --> 00:14:00.280
Always lead off with questions which
are non-threatening so that consumers or

254
00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:03.740
respondents who are answering the survey
can easily get into the survey.

255
00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:09.800
Once all of that is done, hopefully what
you have as an end result is a survey that

256
00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:14.780
is easy to understand, easy to implement,
respondents are comfortable answering it,

257
00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:16.509
and you'll have good data from the survey.

258
00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:21.580
So let me conclude with what we've done in
this whole session about survey design.

259
00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:28.280
One is you think about and carefully look
at a survey as a mini-market research.

260
00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:31.770
What that means is you think
carefully about every question.

261
00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:34.430
You think about how to
design those questions.

262
00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:35.610
What are the best questions to ask?

263
00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:37.610
Should it be open-ended or closed-ended?

264
00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:39.940
Well, it depends upon
what your objective is.

265
00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:41.700
What kind of language should be used?

266
00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:44.200
Again, it depends upon
what the target market is.

267
00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:46.790
So think carefully about when
you're designing a survey.

268
00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:48.640
Each question is very important and

269
00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:51.239
how the questions are ordered
together even more important.

270
00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:55.370
Typically what you want to do is,
if you are asking some

271
00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:59.430
specific kind of questions, for
instance, about customer satisfaction.

272
00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:02.500
There is a lot research that has already
happened in terms of what might be

273
00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:05.050
best ways to answer that question and
ask that question.

274
00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:10.110
What I mean by that is search for
and use proven questions.

275
00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:12.550
That way,
you don't have to do the heavy lifting,

276
00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:15.550
somebody else has already done
the heavy lifting for you.

277
00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:17.420
And finally, before you go ahead and

278
00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:20.500
implement the questionnaire,
always pretest it.

279
00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:23.270
Maybe start out with
a sample of 20 to 30 people

280
00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:26.430
to make sure that they understand
each of the questions.

281
00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:29.500
To make sure that the answer
that you're getting makes sense

282
00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:32.759
before you go ahead and implement that
survey with a much larger sample.

283
00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:37.030
So hopefully with this particular
part of our survey design,

284
00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:40.332
you have a good understanding of
the dos and don'ts of survey design.

285
00:15:40.332 --> 00:15:42.970
What are the things you
should keep track of?

286
00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:46.071
Now you also have a good understanding
of a particular type of question,

287
00:15:46.071 --> 00:15:50.290
the net promoter score, that is
extremely popular in the marketplace.

288
00:15:50.290 --> 00:15:55.040
What I mean by good understanding is you
know the pros, but you also know the cons.

289
00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:57.760
So what I want you take
away from all of these is

290
00:15:57.760 --> 00:15:59.820
that when you start
designing a questionnaire or

291
00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:04.280
a survey, always keep every question
in mind, think about the end goal.

292
00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:08.269
And work backwards whether that particular
question you're asking is going to help

293
00:16:08.269 --> 00:16:09.456
you answer the end goal.
