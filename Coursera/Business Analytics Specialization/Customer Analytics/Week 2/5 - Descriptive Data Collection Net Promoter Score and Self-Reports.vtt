1
00:00:05.488 --> 00:00:08.892
I also want to talk about one particular
type of survey that has gained

2
00:00:08.892 --> 00:00:12.460
a lot of recognition,
that's the Net Promoter Score.

3
00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:13.310
What is that?

4
00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:16.080
It actually just boils
down to one question.

5
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.850
How likely is it that you would
recommend a particular brand,

6
00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:21.050
your company, to a friend or colleague?

7
00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:22.176
Just one question.

8
00:00:22.176 --> 00:00:23.990
It's done on a 0 to 10 scale.

9
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.460
Promoters are people who score a 9 or
a 10 on this scale.

10
00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.320
Passives are people who score a 7 or a 8.

11
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.820
Detractors are people who score 0 to 6.

12
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.320
And what's the Net Promoter Score
of your company?

13
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.390
That's the percentage of promoters
less the percentage of detractors.

14
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.860
So what does this allow you to do?

15
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.429
This basically allows you to
track the health of your brand.

16
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.810
Do your customers overall like you?

17
00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:54.920
Or are there growing percentage of
people who might become detractors?

18
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.147
Now let's talk a little bit
about a concrete example of

19
00:00:58.147 --> 00:01:03.129
the Net Promoter Score, which is something
that is extremely popular across many,

20
00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:05.000
many different companies.

21
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.080
For example Zappos constantly uses
Net Promoter Scores to see how their

22
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.610
customer services.

23
00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.100
There are many other examples of
companies that use Net Promoter Score

24
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.449
to look at how internal people
are doing when they talk to customers.

25
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.442
When you think about Net Promoter Score,

26
00:01:20.442 --> 00:01:22.820
the bigger issue of customer
satisfaction comes to mind.

27
00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.080
And the question is how to
measure customer satisfaction.

28
00:01:27.298 --> 00:01:31.030
On the left-hand side of this chart, you
can see there readily available measures,

29
00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.790
such as operational measures, complaints
analysis, ratings and reviews, and so on.

30
00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.900
On the other extreme right-hand side, you
can have focused efforts such as mystery

31
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.750
shopping, satisfaction surveys, and so on.

32
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.650
It can also have somewhere in the middle,
employee reports.

33
00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.120
So, big question is,
how do you measure customer satisfaction?

34
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.620
And it's in this context that
Net Promoter Score came around.

35
00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:56.227
The idea of Net Promoter Score is the
following, it just asks a single question,

36
00:01:56.227 --> 00:01:59.500
which is basically why it's so
important and so useful.

37
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.640
How likely are you to recommend
a service to a colleague or a friend?

38
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.484
So it's on a zero to ten scale.

39
00:02:06.484 --> 00:02:11.070
As you see here,
numbers from 0 to 6 are called detractors.

40
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.940
These are people who are not as
interested in recommending the service.

41
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.400
The numbers on the top two sides,
which are the 9 and 10,

42
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.120
are called people who are promoters.

43
00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.700
These are people who would clearly promote
the service to a colleague and a friend.

44
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.002
And the Net Promoter Score for
any particular company,

45
00:02:27.002 --> 00:02:31.390
is the percentage of promoters,
which are the people who circled the 9 or

46
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.164
the 10, less the percentage of detractors,
which are people who circled from 0 to 6.

47
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.060
So if you look at the Net Promoter Score,

48
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.086
it's a great way of looking
at how a company is doing.

49
00:02:42.086 --> 00:02:45.300
Obviously, you'd like positive Net
Promoter Scores, because that basically

50
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.760
says that the number of promoters are much
more than the number of detractors.

51
00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.410
If you think about the Net Promoter Score,
they way it came about is from an article

52
00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.110
from Frank Reichheld, who was the one
who talked about the Net Promoter Score.

53
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.000
This was published in HBR.

54
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.890
And what these graphs show
is that Net Promoter Score

55
00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.500
really well captures what's going on
in overall customer satisfaction.

56
00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.710
Now if you think about it, one way of
thinking about customer satisfaction,

57
00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.300
which is the criticism
of Net Promoter Score,

58
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.806
is that there is an American Satisfaction
Consumer Index which is out there,

59
00:03:19.806 --> 00:03:25.820
which is readily measurable,
it's been done for many, many years.

60
00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.240
So a big criticism of Net Promoter Score,
on the flip side,

61
00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.260
is that it's very similar
to the ASCI index.

62
00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.890
In fact, for many industries, what's been
also seen, is that the ASCI index has

63
00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.089
a higher R square with industry growth,
much larger than the Net Promoter Score.

64
00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:47.090
So there is no clear evidence that
the Net Promoter Score is superior

65
00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.770
to other metrics.

66
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:50.290
What am I doing here?

67
00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.435
What I'm showing you again the pros and
the cons.

68
00:03:52.435 --> 00:03:56.091
On the pros side,
the Net Promoter Score is very popular.

69
00:03:56.091 --> 00:03:56.820
Why?

70
00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:57.980
It's a single question.

71
00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.200
It's so easy to implement because that's
what you are asking your customers.

72
00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.040
On the cons side, you also have to
think about what are you getting at?

73
00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.830
If it's about customer satisfaction,

74
00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:13.140
there are other measures that might do
a better job than the Net Promoter Score.

75
00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.590
So keep this in mind as you think about
implementing the Net Promoter Score

76
00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:17.399
in your own company.

77
00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.480
Here's an example, here in the two panels
what you see here, is the R square,

78
00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:28.330
related to the net growth in the industry,
compared to the ASCI index and

79
00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.000
the Net Promoter Score index.

80
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.360
What you see here is for one set of
companies, the R square from the ASCI

81
00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.010
index is actually higher than the R
square from the Net Promoter Score.

82
00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:42.623
So again, keep this in mind as you start
implementing a Net Promoter Score if

83
00:04:42.623 --> 00:04:44.886
you're thinking about
it in your own company.

84
00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:51.269
Now, if you think about it, if you think
from a predictability point of view,

85
00:04:51.269 --> 00:04:54.590
is Net Promoter Score
related profitability?

86
00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.140
One way of thinking about it, indeed yes.

87
00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:01.550
Net Promoter Score can be related to
customer satisfaction, which in fact has

88
00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.730
been shown many times in past work that
it is correlated with profitability.

89
00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.300
Overall, literature generally suggests

90
00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.159
that higher customer satisfaction
leads to positive outcome for a firm.

91
00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:15.410
What's the problem here?

92
00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.260
The link actually might be much weaker
than what managers generally think.

93
00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:24.950
While the correlations are positive,
customer satisfaction

94
00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:28.550
only explains a limited part of
firm value and firm performance.

95
00:05:30.045 --> 00:05:33.190
Now the question might be,
why is that the case?

96
00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:38.200
Intuitively you would think, more
satisfied customers are, they'll be more

97
00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:42.500
happy to do business with that firm, and
hence profitability should be higher.

98
00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.610
While that is indeed the case,
it still explains only a limited part.

99
00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:47.890
Why is that?

100
00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:52.560
Well, one way to think about it is, what
would be a way in which satisfaction and

101
00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.570
profitability might be linked together?

102
00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:56.740
If you look at this graph,

103
00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:01.020
satisfaction is on the horizontal axis,
profitability is on the vertical axis.

104
00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:05.050
The way managers perceive
the link between satisfaction and

105
00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:07.190
profitability is typically
a straight line.

106
00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:13.180
So what they intuitively think is that if
you keep increasing customer satisfaction,

107
00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:15.109
profitability will always keep rising.

108
00:06:16.965 --> 00:06:19.988
Well, what people have found,
in fact it's much more complicated.

109
00:06:19.988 --> 00:06:26.400
Again, what I've plotted here is on
the horizontal axis, we have satisfaction.

110
00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.080
On the vertical axis
we have profitability.

111
00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:30.610
What do we see here?

112
00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:33.728
There is a positive relationship,
but it's not a straight line.

113
00:06:33.728 --> 00:06:39.020
In fact, initially, when you think
about increasing customer satisfaction,

114
00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:43.200
if you're at the lower ends,
you do see an increase in profitability.

115
00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:47.510
But many companies might actually be on
the flat part of the curve, which is,

116
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:49.670
it's kind of business as usual.

117
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:53.930
What you see here is that there
is a big flat region where

118
00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:58.720
increasing satisfaction, does not
actually increase profitability as much.

119
00:07:00.438 --> 00:07:03.350
When you cross that particular region,
then you go to the zone of delight.

120
00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:05.750
Much fewer companies,

121
00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:10.260
these are people who have amazing customer
service, these are the standouts.

122
00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.730
And for them in their particular category,

123
00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:17.229
you would see again that increasing
satisfaction does increase profitability.

124
00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.040
Why do I bring this up?

125
00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:23.040
Because a large number of companies
might be in the flat part.

126
00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:27.780
So, what you might see is,
in your case, in your firm,

127
00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:31.940
increasing satisfaction might not make
a measurable change in profitability.

128
00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:35.350
That doesn't mean that both
of them are not linked,

129
00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:38.380
what it means is they're
not linked linearly.

130
00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:41.237
They might be linked non-linearly.

131
00:07:41.237 --> 00:07:42.007
So again,

132
00:07:42.007 --> 00:07:48.160
you can also find that competition
might impact what this relationship is.

133
00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:49.970
Why do I bring all of this up?

134
00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:54.490
The reason I bring all of this up, in some
sense as a summary, is that whenever you

135
00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:58.010
think about doing any kind of survey,
in this example, we are talking about

136
00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:01.870
the New Promoter Score, there are a couple
of things you want to think about.

137
00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:04.470
The first one is, what is it capturing?

138
00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:07.940
Is it capturing customer satisfaction,
what exactly is it capturing?

139
00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:13.105
How does it compare with other surveys
that could capture the same thing?

140
00:08:13.105 --> 00:08:17.597
That is what we just talked about when
we compared the Net Promoter Score with

141
00:08:17.597 --> 00:08:18.590
the ASCI index.

142
00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:20.685
Does it do better, does it do worse?

143
00:08:20.685 --> 00:08:24.503
How exactly what it's capturing is
different from what other service

144
00:08:24.503 --> 00:08:25.091
could do.

145
00:08:25.091 --> 00:08:29.100
And finally the last part of
it is about predictability.

146
00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:32.520
How does the metric that you're capturing,
in this case, the Net Promoter Score,

147
00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:34.920
link with managerial outcomes
that you're interested in?

148
00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:39.820
Just to summarize,
what we saw in the last few slides was

149
00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:42.920
that you might think that there is
a relationship between satisfaction and

150
00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:45.490
profitability, a positive relationship.

151
00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:49.080
Indeed that is the case, but
it's not typically linear.

152
00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:52.900
There's a large part of the curve
where increasing satisfaction

153
00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:55.410
might not make a measurable
change in profitability.

154
00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:59.610
So again, as you start thinking
about doing your own surveys,

155
00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:01.330
whether it be Net Promoter Score or

156
00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:06.070
other kinds of surveys, keep the following
things in mind, what is it capturing, and

157
00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:08.590
how does it relate to things
that you're interested in?

158
00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:10.690
Be it profitability, stock price,

159
00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:15.070
customer satisfaction, whatever metrics
you are interested in capturing.

160
00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:20.040
Net Promoter Score has found a lot of
leverage in terms of linking the score

161
00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:23.160
to stock prices,
linking the score to future sales, and

162
00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.864
as a leading indicator of
how good your brand is.

163
00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:29.950
So surveys are one clear way of reaching

164
00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:33.450
out to your customers in terms
of collecting data from them.

165
00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:36.090
But there are other ways
customers themselves

166
00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:37.310
might be willing to give you some data.

167
00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:42.400
So besides surveys where the company
is reaching out to customers,

168
00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:44.890
many times customers can
reach out to companies by

169
00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:48.350
giving self reports of what they're
buying and when they're buying it.

170
00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:51.510
So InfoScout is one example of
a company that actually attracts or

171
00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:54.550
incentivizes customers
to do the following.

172
00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:57.400
Once they have made their purchases,
they take the receipt,

173
00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:01.260
they have the mobile device, take
a picture of the receipt and send it back.

174
00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:02.920
What does InfoScout do with it?

175
00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:06.570
They basically collect all of this
information across many, many customers,

176
00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:09.457
to get insights into when people
are buying certain products,

177
00:10:09.457 --> 00:10:13.325
where are they buying it, is it at pop
stores, is it in convenience stores,

178
00:10:13.325 --> 00:10:14.730
is it in big box stores?

179
00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:19.060
So, that's one example in which customers
are giving companies that information.

180
00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:22.020
Another example would be
word of mouth dynamics.

181
00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:25.740
So, as a company, we would like to
know what people are purchasing, but

182
00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:27.634
we'd also want to know what
people are talking about.

183
00:10:27.634 --> 00:10:29.470
How is our brand being mentioned?

184
00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:32.980
So, there are many companies out
there that collect this type of data.

185
00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:37.430
As an example, Keller Fay is a company
that collects word of mouth dynamics.

186
00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:38.530
How do they do that?

187
00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:43.620
They have panel of customers which
basically are given the following task,

188
00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:46.510
when you talk to somebody note it down.

189
00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:47.610
Who is it?
Is it a friend?

190
00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:48.530
Is it a colleague?

191
00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:50.080
What did you talk about?

192
00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:53.432
Collecting this data in a diary
format over time, across months,

193
00:10:53.432 --> 00:10:57.160
they are able to observe what
people are talking about,

194
00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:00.830
who are they talking to,
how is a brand being mentioned, and so on.

195
00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:04.570
So word of mouth dynamics is
a powerful way of understanding

196
00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:07.664
how the brand sentiment might be
changing over time, and [INAUDIBLE].

197
00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:09.800
Now, again there are many,

198
00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:13.050
many different ways in which
people can collect this data.

199
00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:15.512
Keller Fay is a company that
does this through a panel data,

200
00:11:15.512 --> 00:11:16.556
through a diary format.

201
00:11:16.556 --> 00:11:19.388
And there are other unobtrusive ways
of collecting this data as well,

202
00:11:19.388 --> 00:11:20.640
which we'll talk about next.

203
00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:26.010
So at this point, we talked about
active ways of data collection.

204
00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:29.355
Next we'll about unobtrusive
passive ways of data collection.
