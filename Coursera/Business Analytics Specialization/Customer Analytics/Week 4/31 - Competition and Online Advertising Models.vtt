00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.750
In this lecture, I will show different
examples of different models and

2
00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.420
how asking a different question or

3
00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:13.290
a wrong question might actually get you to
the wrong recommendation or prescription.

4
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.950
This is why in prescriptive analytics
it's very important to understand

5
00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:23.180
how the actions actually affect
the goal that we're trying to maximize.

6
00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.600
So what we've covered so far is what
are goals, what are actions, and

7
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.270
what are models, okay?

8
00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.980
And we've seen how several examples
in which changing the model,

9
00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.950
but using the same data,
impacts the recommended action.

10
00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.110
We've seen that sometimes we
recommend the lower price, let's say,

11
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.280
to maximize the quantity sold.

12
00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.490
Sometimes we recommend the higher
price to maximize the revenue sold.

13
00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:52.060
And sometimes we recommend an even higher
price to maximize the profits generated,

14
00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.740
mostly because the cost range reduced.

15
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.850
And it is very,
very important to ask the right question.

16
00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.140
What are we trying to maximize, and what
our consumers are doing in this market?

17
00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.370
Now let's see a few examples.

18
00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.820
The first example I would like to discuss
is the competition between two different

19
00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:09.790
firms.

20
00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.840
So, the question is did we assume anything
in the previous analysis that would not

21
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.160
apply to a case of competitive firms and

22
00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:23.060
when there is a competing product that
can take market share from our product?

23
00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.580
And the answer is, yes, we did.

24
00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.810
We assumed that if we
are changing the price,

25
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.730
the consumers behave according
to that demand model that we've

26
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.490
described from the data, but we didn't
say if other companies might also

27
00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.940
reciprocate with a lower price,
or maybe a higher price.

28
00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.680
But in reality, if we lower the price,

29
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.570
wouldn't the competitor
also lower the price?

30
00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.190
And then the question,
what do we need to do in response?

31
00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.750
If the competitor lowers the price
a little bit below us, and

32
00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.060
all of the consumers go and
buy that competitor's product,

33
00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.710
should we lower the price even
a little bit below that consumer?

34
00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.640
If we do that, that competitor
will also lower their price, and

35
00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.160
we will lower the price, and then when we
lower the price, we will get a price war].

36
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.840
And actually the profit will be eroded and
maybe the profit will be zero.

37
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.190
What I've just described,

38
00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.940
which is my company is responding to the
competitor's company, and the competitor's

39
00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.120
company is responding to my price change,
this is called strategic interaction.

40
00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.180
And this is what the field of game theory
typically handles and tries to solve.

41
00:02:31.205 --> 00:02:33.925
Another problem I'm going
to introduce now, and

42
00:02:33.925 --> 00:02:37.455
in the next lecture I'm going to
show you some details about it.

43
00:02:37.455 --> 00:02:43.410
So let's take a look at how
Online Advertising works on the web.

44
00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.940
Basically these are the websites
that you all browse, too.

45
00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.530
These are all of the online ads that you
see, the pop-ups, the ads that chase

46
00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.480
you and follow you after you put
a product in the shopping cart.

47
00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:00.120
And what companies can do when they show
you these ads, they need to make a choice,

48
00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.130
do they show the ads to you, or do they
show the ads to a different consumer?

49
00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.900
And also what they can do is,
they can say,

50
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.360
I wanna show one consumer the same ad but
on multiple websites.

51
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:19.071
If this consumer visits Yahoo.com and
eBay.com and Amazon.com and

52
00:03:19.071 --> 00:03:24.005
CNN.com, I'm gonna show the same
ad to the same consumer,

53
00:03:24.005 --> 00:03:28.580
and these ads are gonna
chase this consumer.

54
00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:29.590
Now because it is very,

55
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.360
very hard to tell if those ads actually
impacted the consumer's decision to buy

56
00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.810
a product, what companies do is they
do something called attribution.

57
00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:44.060
At the end of the process, they try to
measure what was the impact of each ad

58
00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.540
on the consumer's decision to purchase.

59
00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.380
One simple way to do that is to say,
did the consumer click the ad?

60
00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:56.250
If consumers click the ads more,
probably the ad have more impact.

61
00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.230
And what companies are trying to measure
is something called click-through rate,

62
00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.270
which is, basically,
if I showed this ad to 100 consumers,

63
00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:06.800
how many of them are gonna
actually click the ad?

64
00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:11.000
And this ratio of the number of consumers
that clicked to the number of consumers

65
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.200
that have seen the ads is actually
the click-through rate of the ad.

66
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.030
So let's see an example.

67
00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:23.680
What you see in this graph is basically
how advertisers analyze data online.

68
00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.180
What they say is, they say,
I'm gonna show these ads

69
00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.320
to the same consumer on different
Channels or different websites.

70
00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.780
On the x-axis you'll see

71
00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.240
is the number of Channels that
showed an ad to the same consumer.

72
00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.520
So some consumers have seen 0 ads,
just didn't see any ads.

73
00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:47.655
Some consumers have seen 1 ad, some
consumers have seen ads on 2 websites,

74
00:04:47.655 --> 00:04:51.200
some consumers have
seen ads on 3 websites.

75
00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.320
And on the left hand side,
we see the click-through rate.

76
00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:55.701
What is the probability or

77
00:04:55.701 --> 00:04:59.650
the percentage of consumers that
actually clicked on the ad?

78
00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.720
So if you see no ads,
you don't click on ads.

79
00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.700
That's great, that's perfect.

80
00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:08.440
And it will appear from this
analysis that if you show more and

81
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:13.540
more ads to the consumers on different
website,s they click more and more ads.

82
00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:17.140
The probability of clicking goes higher,
which would imply

83
00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:22.620
that actually those ads become more and
more impactful the more ads you show.

84
00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.640
In the next lecture, what I will show
you is how you can analyze this data,

85
00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:30.450
and try to understand does
this model make sense?

86
00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:32.460
Does showing more and

87
00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:38.150
more ads to a consumer actually increase
the probability of them clicking the ads?
