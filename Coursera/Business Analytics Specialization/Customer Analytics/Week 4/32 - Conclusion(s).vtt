00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:01.862
So in the previous lecture,

2
00:00:01.862 --> 00:00:05.380
I concluded by showing you a graph
of a normal advertising campaign.

3
00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:08.504
So this is real data from a real
campaign that I collected.

4
00:00:08.504 --> 00:00:11.785
And what we see on the x
axis is the amount

5
00:00:11.785 --> 00:00:16.660
of websites that exposes
specific consumer to ads.

6
00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.580
And on the y axis on the left,
we'll see the click-through rate.

7
00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.720
What is the the probability of a consumer
clicking on those ads if they see more and

8
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.330
more of ads on different channels?

9
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.496
Now is this conclusion,
is this model correct?

10
00:00:30.496 --> 00:00:32.920
Let's try to think about it, right?

11
00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.045
Does it make sense that the more
we expose consumers to ads,

12
00:00:37.045 --> 00:00:39.036
the more they click on them?

13
00:00:39.036 --> 00:00:41.456
Are there any alternative explanations, or

14
00:00:41.456 --> 00:00:45.430
can we think of other things
that might happen in this data?

15
00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:46.200
You know what?

16
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.400
Let's try to look at a different
experiment we tried and

17
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.510
see what the data tells us.

18
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.791
So because we measure click-through rates,
and

19
00:00:54.791 --> 00:00:59.870
because those networks are actually
compensated by click-through rates,

20
00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:06.270
that is, the advertisers pays the websites
if consumers clicked more on their ads.

21
00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.740
Maybe the websites will
show ads to consumers who

22
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.170
will actually click the ads anyway.

23
00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.720
That is, the websites know how
to recognize consumers that

24
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.150
click a lot of ads.

25
00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.780
And they show them the ads even
though the ads have no impact.

26
00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.012
And that might be what may be going on.

27
00:01:23.012 --> 00:01:25.533
So let's take a look at this graph.

28
00:01:25.533 --> 00:01:28.210
And this graph is very, very interesting.

29
00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:34.654
In this case, what we see is, we show the
click-through rate, or the probability of

30
00:01:34.654 --> 00:01:40.483
clicking an ad after a consumer has
already visited the advertiser website.

31
00:01:40.483 --> 00:01:42.523
That is, a consumer has said,

32
00:01:42.523 --> 00:01:46.292
I'm going to buy the product
with a very high probability.

33
00:01:46.292 --> 00:01:50.968
And only after that, the website starts
showing the consumer those ads, many,

34
00:01:50.968 --> 00:01:53.290
many, many, many times.

35
00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.980
And what we can see is that
If you show an individual

36
00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.670
ad after that visit, actually there is
some increase in click-through rates.

37
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.470
Actually consumers say this ad reminded
me of the product I didn't buy, and

38
00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.200
leave in my shopping cart.

39
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.150
Or maybe I would like to
look at that brand again.

40
00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.250
And actually, there's a bump there,
moving from 0 to 1,

41
00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.250
from seeing no ads to
actually seeing 1 ad.

42
00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.260
But when we increase the number of
ads shown more and more, that is when

43
00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.325
we show more and more ads on different
websites, we go back to the same

44
00:02:30.325 --> 00:02:35.560
click-through rate that we had just
before we showed the additional ad.

45
00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.700
That is, those websites actually
know how to recognize consumers

46
00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.650
who will click the ads anyway but
have no impact on the click-through rate.

47
00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.982
The click-through rate doesn't go up.

48
00:02:45.982 --> 00:02:49.930
It just remains the same and
I show more and more ads.

49
00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.850
So just to conclude, we've seen examples
of how applying the same descriptive

50
00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.050
data in the same predictive
analytics to different goals and

51
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.670
different models actually finds
a different optimal action.

52
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.890
And we've shown how to find this
action depending on our goal.

53
00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.690
Many times we think or
we sometimes make the mistake of saying

54
00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.410
this graph describes what
consumers actually do.

55
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.070
If I decrease the price,
the consumers will buy more.

56
00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.610
And if I increase the price,
the consumers will buy less,

57
00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.590
which is kind of a general truth.

58
00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.360
But what we don't know is what
happens outside of this graph.

59
00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.120
And many times, the interpretation as
a causal model is slightly problematic,

60
00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.720
as we've seen in the previous slide.

61
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.720
If we think that ads are shown
randomly to consumers, then of course,

62
00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:47.480
when we show more ads, the graph implies
that consumers click more on the ads.

63
00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.370
But if the websites can choose who to
show the ads to, maybe they will show

64
00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.990
the ads to consumers that will click the
ads anyway just to maximize their profit.

65
00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:01.250
And then our conclusion is incorrect.

66
00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.020
So to summarize,
what we need to do is we need to be very,

67
00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:09.240
very careful about drawing
the conclusions from the descriptive data

68
00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.800
into an action that might
yield the wrong conclusion.

69
00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.140
In order to solve that, we sometimes need
to run an experiment or we need to test

70
00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:21.984
different models to see which one
actually describes the reality the best.

71
00:04:23.245 --> 00:04:27.285
So if you would like to learn more about
this topics, what I've discussed in this

72
00:04:27.285 --> 00:04:32.235
set of lectures is covered in different
fields in economics, in marketing, and

73
00:04:32.235 --> 00:04:34.105
also in other areas.

74
00:04:34.105 --> 00:04:40.870
Specifically, consumer theory in economics
covers basic pricing theories and

75
00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.860
the optimization exercises we've
done in this set of lectures.

76
00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.270
In addition, competition and

77
00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.240
more sophisticated models require
knowing some game theory.

78
00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.620
And within economics, the field is
called industrial organization, or IO,

79
00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.560
that looks at how companies compete and
also interact with consumers.

80
00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.820
In the next set of lectures, you will
see a range of applications discussing

81
00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:09.030
different case studies and applying
the different principles you've learned in

82
00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.700
this lectures in the customer
analytics course.
