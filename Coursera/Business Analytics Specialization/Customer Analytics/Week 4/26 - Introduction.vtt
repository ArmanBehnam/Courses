Hello, I'm Ron Berman.

2
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.270
I'm an Assistant Professor of
Marketing here at the Wharton school.

3
00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:10.790
And I'm standing in the front
of the beautiful Locust Walk

4
00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:12.910
here in the summer of Philadelphia.

5
00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:15.850
And what I do at Wharton is I
teach digital marketing, and

6
00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.370
I do research on how consumers
interact with websites,

7
00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:24.670
how companies compete online, how online
advertising works and on other topics.

8
00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.670
Today I'm very excited to talk to you
about prescriptive customer analytics and

9
00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.360
how it can apply to what
you've seen from the previous

10
00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.870
sessions about descriptive analytics and
about predictive analytics.
