00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.520
Today we're gonna discuss
prescriptive analytics.

2
00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.390
And the first thing I would like to
do is discuss the differences between

3
00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.240
prescriptive analytics and descriptive and

4
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.800
predictive analytics to which you were
exposed in the previous lectures.

5
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.430
Descriptive analytics takes data,
collects it, and

6
00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:19.380
tries to map the data to patterns
that you can understand in the data.

7
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.620
And predictive analytics try to
take the behavior of consumers and

8
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.360
predict from their past behavior what
they're going to do in the future.

9
00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.660
What we're going to do with prescriptions
is we're going to try to give

10
00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:29.510
a recommendation.

11
00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:34.220
We're going to try and say given
the prediction that we had before and

12
00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.900
given the description of how consumers
interact with let's say companies and

13
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.460
with other consumers,
can we give a recommendation

14
00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.130
on what the company needs to do in order
to change the behavior of consumers.

15
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.260
We will cover four things today.

16
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.860
We will cover how to define a prescription
problem, or how to define a goal,

17
00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.890
and what we would like to solve in order
to improve the actions of a company.

18
00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.160
Or define two terms which
are the objective of a company, or

19
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.920
the goal of a company, and also we will
try to look at how a company can optimize.

20
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.450
What can a company do in
order to reach that goal and

21
00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.890
what actions can a company
do to achieve that goal?

22
00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.210
Finally we are going to look at models.

23
00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.870
We're gonna discuss how taking an action
connects to the goal of the company and

24
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.370
influences that.

25
00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:27.170
And towards the end, we're gonna take a
very brief introduction into competition,

26
00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.180
or how companies interact and
respond to actions by other companies.

27
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.030
The first thing I would like to do
is tell you what the problem is.

28
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.880
Now, it sounds very vague, so

29
00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.430
I'm gonna show an example in a few
seconds, but by saying a problem,

30
00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.370
what I would like to say is,
I would like to say I need to have a goal.

31
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.720
Something I would like to maximize,
to optimize, to achieve.

32
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.820
And I can achieve this
goal by taking actions.

33
00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.160
Now the way to map how actions
influence the goal is called the model.

34
00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.770
And now let's take a few minutes
to take a look at the very,

35
00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.870
very unique example that actually
you've seen in the previous lecture.

36
00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.280
So the first example I would
like to talk about is,

37
00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.830
how do you find what is the optimal price,

38
00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.080
or the best price to set, in order to
sell the maximum quantity of product.

39
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.400
So in the descriptive lecture, Professor
Iyengar has shown you before the following

40
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.330
demand curve or the following graph.

41
00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.520
And in this what you can see on the x-axis
is the price you set for a product.

42
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.850
And on the y-axis,

43
00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.880
you can see the quantity being sold when
you change the price of the product.

44
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.010
And as you can see, when you increase
the price, the quantity goes down.

45
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.100
Now let's try to define an objective or
a goal.

46
00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.710
And the first thing we would like
to do is we would like to say

47
00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.530
how can we sell the most
quantity of the product?

48
00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.510
How can we maximize the quantity
of the product being sold, right?

49
00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.870
In this case, the goal or the objective
is just to maximize quantity.

50
00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.480
The quantity we wanna make
it as large as possible.

51
00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.970
And the action we can take
is just a simple action.

52
00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.660
We can just change the price.

53
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.450
We can change the price of the product,
increase it or decrease it.

54
00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.720
And by changing the price,
we either encourage or

55
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.280
discourage consumers whether to buy or
not to buy the product.

56
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.730
Finally, we need a model.

57
00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.210
Now models can be very, very complex, but
in this case we already have the model,

58
00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.640
and the model is basically the graph
I showed you two slides ago, and

59
00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.870
you can also see on
the bottom right corner.

60
00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.250
And the model basically tells us,
if we change the price,

61
00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.820
let's say if we increase the price,
by how much did the quantity go down?

62
00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:40.280
For example we look at this graph,
we can see that

63
00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.410
setting a price of 1 sold
the maximum quantity of the product.

64
00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.430
And the question is, can we change
the price even more to do better?

65
00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.300
Can we use some sort of prediction or

66
00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:56.990
recommendation to give to the company to
say, can we increase the quantity sold?

67
00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:59.280
And the answer is actually, yes.

68
00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.520
We may not be able to give money
to people to buy the product.

69
00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.800
We can't actually spend money
to get them to buy the product.

70
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.940
We can probably give them the product for
free.

71
00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.910
We can actually set the price to be 0.

72
00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.595
In this case we're taking
the regression we've seen before, or

73
00:04:17.595 --> 00:04:21.101
kind of extending the line
to the left hand side.

74
00:04:21.101 --> 00:04:26.413
And then we can see using the regression
equation, that if we plug in x=0,

75
00:04:26.413 --> 00:04:31.642
which means the price equals 0,
we'll get the volume of y of 10.13,

76
00:04:31.642 --> 00:04:35.140
which is the maximum quantity we can sell.

77
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:39.530
So, in this example, what I tried to
show you is we can change the price to

78
00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.320
increase or decrease the quantity sold.

79
00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:47.660
Our goal was to maximise the quantity we
sell, and the model was just the graph and

80
00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.380
the regression equation that
Professor Iyengar had shown you.

81
00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.860
And I've shown you how finding
a lower price increases the quantity.
