00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.320
In the second example I would like
to show you, I will show you how you

2
00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:07.140
can use the same data from the descriptive
part, and actually get a completely

3
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.350
different conclusion, and actually make a
different recommendation for the company.

4
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.050
And this is the power of the prescription.

5
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.740
You can use different, or the same data,
but to achieve different goals and

6
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.150
take different action.

7
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.290
So let's say now we wanna maximize
the revenue by the company.

8
00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:24.930
Most companies actually don't wanna
maximize the amount of the product they

9
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.870
sell, but they show you they want
to make the most money, right, or

10
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.020
generate the most revenue
by selling a product.

11
00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.660
We can use a demand curve that
Professor Wachter has shown you,

12
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.790
to estimate actually, also what
will be the revenue of the company,

13
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.900
not only how much product will be sold.

14
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.170
So let's see how we can do that.

15
00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.200
The first thing we would like to do, is
define the goal, as we defined it before.

16
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.840
And the goal is to maximize revenue,

17
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.940
unlike in the previous example
where we try to maximize quantity.

18
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.310
The other thing we need
to define is the action.

19
00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.890
And the action is again,
the same action as before.

20
00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.660
Setting the price, or changing the price.

21
00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:02.710
And the question is,

22
00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:08.170
how does changing a price impact the
revenue generated from selling a product?

23
00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.540
In this case, we need a model.

24
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.750
We need a model to describe what is the
relationship between setting prices and

25
00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.280
setting quantities of product,
to generating revenue by a company.

26
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.570
And now we need to think a little bit, and
think what happens when we increase or

27
00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.670
decrease the price of a product,
for the revenue of a company?

28
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.750
Now one thing you're asking,
how do we calculate revenue, perhaps?

29
00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.260
Well you take the amount of a product
sold, the quantity, and you multiply it

30
00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.150
by the price, and this is the total
revenue generated by the company.

31
00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.890
So in this case,
we have two forces operating here.

32
00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.580
What happens, for example,
when we decrease the price?

33
00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.870
When we decrease the price, as we've seen
before, the quantity sold goes up, right?

34
00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.430
So we sell higher
quantities of the product.

35
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.000
But on the other hand,
the amount of money were making for

36
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.410
each item sold is lower,
because we decreased the price.

37
00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:00.740
So when we multiply both,
one side of the multiplication goes up,

38
00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.578
which is the quantity, and the other side,
which is the price, goes down.

39
00:02:04.578 --> 00:02:07.950
And we can't really tell if
the revenue will go up, or going down,

40
00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.284
by decreasing the price.

41
00:02:09.284 --> 00:02:11.463
The same thing happens when
we increase the price.

42
00:02:11.463 --> 00:02:15.193
If you increase the price,
the quantity sold goes down,

43
00:02:15.193 --> 00:02:20.430
but the price per item, with the revenue
generated per item, goes up.

44
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.080
And again, we can't really tell if
it's better to increase the price, or

45
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.620
decrease the price.

46
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.840
Now what I would like to point out,
is this is called a trade-off,

47
00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.350
where you change, you make one action,
you set a price, but

48
00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.510
the revenue or
the goal of the company might go up, or

49
00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.550
it might go down, depending on
what the actual result will be.

50
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:41.310
And the question is,

51
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.630
how can we find the price that
generates the maximum revenue for us?

52
00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.080
So let's see how we can do that.

53
00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.220
One thing we would like to do,
is we can use Excel and try to say, for

54
00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.520
each price, we actually create a table,
as you can see, the bottom of the slide.

55
00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.394
For each price, what would be the quantity
sold, which is the column called Demand,

56
00:03:02.394 --> 00:03:06.606
and what would be the revenue,
where we maximize the demand by the price.

57
00:03:06.606 --> 00:03:10.230
So for example, you could see that for

58
00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.892
a price of $3.00,
the demand will be 7.43 items,

59
00:03:15.892 --> 00:03:20.213
and the total revenue will be $22.29.

60
00:03:20.213 --> 00:03:25.163
And if we increase the price more and
more, the revenue goes up and

61
00:03:25.163 --> 00:03:29.140
up, but
at some point the revenue goes down.

62
00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.050
And the question is, can we find the price
that generates the maximum revenue?

63
00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:35.880
Now in this table, it's quite simple.

64
00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.530
We can just go by the order of the prices,
and

65
00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.570
see which one generates
the maximum amount.

66
00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:45.620
But in the general case,
problems can be very hard to solve.

67
00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:51.420
A lot of variables to change, many actions
to take, many it's not a discrete.

68
00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.520
One way we can do it and solve it,
is try to take a graphical approach,

69
00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.300
and find where the maximum revenue is.

70
00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.220
So in this slide, what you will see
is where I drew a graph that takes

71
00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.092
the previous table from
the previous slide, and

72
00:04:05.092 --> 00:04:09.226
generates a graph where you can see
the actual revenue on the y-axis,

73
00:04:09.226 --> 00:04:12.266
as a function of the price
changing on the x-axis.

74
00:04:12.266 --> 00:04:16.392
And you can see, for
example, that in this case,

75
00:04:16.392 --> 00:04:22.789
the maximum revenue is generated
with approximately a price of $5.50.

76
00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:24.900
How do we find this maximum?

77
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.270
We try to find the point in
the graph which is maximized.

78
00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.270
Here it's highlighted by this arrow, and

79
00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.280
then we take the dashed line,
basically going to the bottom,

80
00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:42.990
finding on the x-axis the price
that generates this revenue.

81
00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.130
And this is the price we're
saying is gonna maximize revenue,

82
00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:50.068
in this case $5.50.

83
00:04:50.068 --> 00:04:54.520
So what we've done so far, we've discussed
what a problem is that we would like to

84
00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.010
solve, and get a prescription for.

85
00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:58.450
A problem is three parts.

86
00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:02.000
It has a goal to optimize,
which can be to maximize,

87
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.770
to minimize,
to do something with the quantity.

88
00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.220
It has actions the company or
the consumer can take.

89
00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.176
It can be changing the price,
producing product,

90
00:05:12.176 --> 00:05:16.460
maybe showing an ad to someone,
but different actions.

91
00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.579
And it has a model that links the action,
and how they impact the different goals,

92
00:05:20.579 --> 00:05:24.290
or the different objectives
we're trying to optimize.

93
00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:28.530
Using the same descriptive analytics that
you've seen in the previous lectures,

94
00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:30.690
we arrived at two different conclusions.

95
00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:34.460
If you want to maximize the quantity sold,
you should set a zero price.

96
00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:35.836
You should give your product for free.

97
00:05:35.836 --> 00:05:39.940
If you wanna maximize the revenue
generated by selling a product,

98
00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.310
actually you wanna set a price of $5.50.

99
00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:48.600
The next thing I would like to do in the
next lecture, is talking about parameters,

100
00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.697
and how different parts of
the model impact the decision and

101
00:05:52.697 --> 00:05:55.460
recommendation we will give the company.

102
00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:59.580
And the next one after that,
we will discuss market structure.

103
00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:03.610
Can we actually take the descriptive data,
and find the optimal price,

104
00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:07.730
without really knowing how the customers
interact with the product in the market?
