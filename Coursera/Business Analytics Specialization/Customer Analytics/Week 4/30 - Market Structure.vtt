00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.320
So, in this lecture, we're going to
discuss market structure, and

2
00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.600
how the different types of
consumers in the market and

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.090
companies in the market actually
affect our choice of optimum price

4
00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.770
of the maximum profit that we
found in the previous lectures.

5
00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:17.290
So, before we begin,
let's try to think for a minute.

6
00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:20.420
Would it make a difference if
we knew that in this market

7
00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.200
there was a single consumer or multiple
consumers that were buying the product?

8
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.790
Also, does it matter if there's
a competing product to the product

9
00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:29.810
we're selling?

10
00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.450
So, why I am asking these questions?

11
00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:33.470
Let's see a very simple example.

12
00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.110
If there are competing products for
the products I'm selling,

13
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.540
if I increase the price, maybe some of
the consumers buy less of my product,

14
00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.410
maybe they just switch to buy a cheaper
product, and they become more

15
00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.180
brand loyal to that other product, and
will never return to buy my product again.

16
00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.690
So, let's take a look at what market
structure is, and how different examples

17
00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.180
actually change the maximum profit we
can gain in different market structures.

18
00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:03.210
So, the structure of the market is
the part of the model, and so far,

19
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.910
in the model, what we tried to answer is
how do the actions affect the goal or

20
00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:10.600
the objective we're trying to maximize.

21
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.840
Now, we're also adding the question,

22
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.860
what else is everyone else in the market
doing when we're taking these actions?

23
00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.340
So, for example, if we change the price,

24
00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.030
do other companies in the market
also change the price?

25
00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.960
And the question is, can we use the same
descriptive data that we have before

26
00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.035
also affect and guide our
decision to find an optimal price

27
00:01:34.035 --> 00:01:37.275
under different market structures and
different models?

28
00:01:37.275 --> 00:01:38.975
And the answer is of course, we can.

29
00:01:38.975 --> 00:01:41.255
And let's see two of these examples.

30
00:01:41.255 --> 00:01:45.625
In the first example, I would like to
show you the answer to the question,

31
00:01:45.625 --> 00:01:48.625
what happens when we
know that in our market,

32
00:01:48.625 --> 00:01:51.520
there are many consumers
who purchase the product?

33
00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.220
So, let's assume now, for example,
that in this market, there are many,

34
00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.700
many, many consumers, and
the demand curve we've seen in the graph

35
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.040
was generated by each consumer
purchasing up to one item.

36
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.070
So, either a consumer purchases
zero items or one items,

37
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.760
but no consumers want to purchase more.

38
00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.970
If we decrease the price to nothing,

39
00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.700
every consumer will take at
most one product and use them.

40
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.570
Is the price of 6.5 still optimal,

41
00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.530
that the price we found in our previous
lecture that maximizes the profit.

42
00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.170
The answer is actually yes.

43
00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.450
If you think about it, there's no change
in the demand function of the graph or

44
00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.220
the revenue table we generated,
by the fact that we know there

45
00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.720
are multiple consumers,
each one wanted to buy, at most, one item.

46
00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.700
What I would like to look
at now is what would happen

47
00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.550
if we knew that the demand curve, that we
saw before, came from a single consumer.

48
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.530
And the question is, what is
the difference if we know that we have one

49
00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.530
single consumer in the market versus
multiple consumers in the market?

50
00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.110
One thing that we can think about or

51
00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.690
notice is that if there is a single
consumer and the demand curve shows that

52
00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.560
at different prices there
are multiple items being sold,

53
00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.590
it probably means that the consumer may
want to purchase more than one item.

54
00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:08.980
So, what we can do is we can try and

55
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.970
change the way we're selling
items to the consumer.

56
00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.180
The question is, will the consumer be
willing to pay different prices for

57
00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.290
different amounts of the same item?

58
00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.560
Can we sell item at a different
price than a second item, etc.

59
00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.200
So, let's take a look at the following
table to understand how this works.

60
00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.460
What we would like to do is calculate
something called willingness to pay.

61
00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.540
And willingness to pay is how much,

62
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.610
at most, a consumer is willing to pay for
the next item we're selling them.

63
00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:44.408
So, imagine the following sales process,
the consumer comes and

64
00:03:44.408 --> 00:03:48.778
I'm going to tell them,
the first item costs $10.70 and

65
00:03:48.778 --> 00:03:53.960
the second item is going to cost $9 and
the third item is going to cost $7.

66
00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:59.030
Will the consumer still willing
to buy all of these products?

67
00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.920
On the table on the right-hand side,
you can see this calculation in quantities

68
00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.470
of half items, and generally,
you can do that for whole number of items,

69
00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:13.320
half items, quarter items, etc.,
depending on the type of the product.

70
00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:17.781
What we can see on the right-hand side is
that for a different quantity of items

71
00:04:17.781 --> 00:04:21.420
sold, I'm calculating the price
of the next item to be sold.

72
00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:26.800
For example, if I already sold
one item for the next half item,

73
00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.910
the consumer will be willing to
pay between $10.14 to $9.59,

74
00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:36.370
which is basically the prices
on the demand curve.

75
00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:41.305
And then, the prices, let's say, of
the next half item between three items, so

76
00:04:41.305 --> 00:04:47.670
3.5 items is going to be
$7.92 to a price of $7.37.

77
00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:51.130
We can take these numbers and
try to calculate an average

78
00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:55.630
price the consumer will be willing to
pay for this additional half item.

79
00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:59.410
The way to do that is to calculate
the surface below the demand curve or

80
00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.570
the graph, because basically,
it gives us kind of the average price

81
00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:08.330
that the consumer will be willing to pay
for each fractional part of the item.

82
00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.232
So, lets take a look at two examples.

83
00:05:10.232 --> 00:05:15.070
If I never sold any item to the consumer,
I know that for

84
00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:18.900
the first fractional item, the consumer
is willing to pay a price of $11.26, and

85
00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:24.190
when the consumer reaches half an item,

86
00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:29.570
they will be willing to pay at most
$10.70 for this additional fraction.

87
00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:34.970
And if we do this average price,
which is basically the trapezoid

88
00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:39.914
surface below the curve,
we will get a willingness to pay of $5.49.

89
00:05:39.914 --> 00:05:46.170
We can do this same analysis for items
between three and three and a half Items.

90
00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:49.560
And we will see that for
a quantity between three and three and

91
00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:54.420
a half items,
the willingness to pay will be $3.82.

92
00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:58.070
Now, we know how much a consumer is
willing to pay for each additional item,

93
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.210
the question is what is
the profit we're making?

94
00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:02.170
In order to understand the profit,

95
00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:06.410
we need to look at the cost as well, which
is the fourth column on the table, and

96
00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:10.880
compare it to the willingness to pay
which is the third column on the table.

97
00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.160
If we do the calculation,

98
00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.430
basically we will take the willingness
to pay minus the cost.

99
00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:17.980
And we'll get the profit we will make for

100
00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:21.540
each additional half item
we're selling to the consumer.

101
00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:25.252
So, for the first half item,
we will get $4.49.

102
00:06:25.252 --> 00:06:30.543
For the second half item,
we'll get $4.29, and then,

103
00:06:30.543 --> 00:06:37.054
that means for that one first item,
that is first half plus the second half,

104
00:06:37.054 --> 00:06:41.569
we will get a profit of $4.49 plus $4.29.

105
00:06:41.569 --> 00:06:44.918
Now, if we're looking how
much we will make for

106
00:06:44.918 --> 00:06:50.196
the fourth item we're selling,
which means between three to four items,

107
00:06:50.196 --> 00:06:55.020
then we will be getting the willingness
to pay between 3 to 3.5.

108
00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:58.650
The profit is 2.82, and

109
00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:03.138
the profit between 3.5 and
4, and the profit is 2.54.

110
00:07:03.138 --> 00:07:08.730
And that sum will be the profit for
the fourth item that we're selling.

111
00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:12.510
What we can do is we can calculate
the total profit we will be making for

112
00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:15.950
each bundle, or each quantity
of products we will be selling.

113
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:20.840
So, we can do it for up to one item,
up to two items, up to three items, etc.

114
00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:23.980
And all the way going
down to up to nine items.

115
00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:28.960
And what you will notice is that
at the ninth half item at the end,

116
00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:30.860
actually it's the 18th half item, but

117
00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:34.890
it's the ninth item we're selling,
the profit is becoming negative.

118
00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:38.100
That is the willingness
to pay of the consumer

119
00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:42.260
is less than the cost it is costing
us to actually produce the product.

120
00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:46.480
It means that it's not worthwhile for me,
and I'm not making a profit from sending

121
00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:51.430
an additional item to the consumer,
and I would probably like to stop.

122
00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:54.400
So, how can we use all of
this to increase our profit?

123
00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:57.500
What we can do is we can sell
something called a bundle.

124
00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:00.760
And a bundle is basically a take it or
leave it offer to the consumer.

125
00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:04.690
In a bundle, we're telling this consumer,
you can buy this quantity of

126
00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:09.130
items at this fixed price, or
you can get nothing, and it's your choice.

127
00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:13.880
So, what would happen if we
offered the consumer eight and

128
00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:17.400
a half items at the price of $55.53.

129
00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:20.151
The first question we want to ask is,

130
00:08:20.151 --> 00:08:25.720
is the consumer going to still buy
our bundle, and the answer is yes.

131
00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:30.070
The answer is yes, because this is the sum
of the consumer's willingness to pay, and

132
00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:32.810
we know that for
each one of those partial items,

133
00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:35.790
the consumer will still be
willing to pay this price.

134
00:08:35.790 --> 00:08:37.450
The second question we
would like to ask is,

135
00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:40.210
what is the total cost of
producing this bundle?

136
00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:41.650
And the answer is, eight and

137
00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:46.600
a half items times $2, which is the cost
for a whole item we're going to produce.

138
00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:48.004
This is $17.

139
00:08:48.004 --> 00:08:53.216
And the profit will be the revenue, $55.53

140
00:08:53.216 --> 00:08:58.565
minus 17 dollars, which totals $38.53.

141
00:08:58.565 --> 00:09:02.562
The interesting thing to notice
is that if we compare this case,

142
00:09:02.562 --> 00:09:07.372
which is selling one bundle to one
consumer, we actually are sending a higher

143
00:09:07.372 --> 00:09:12.930
quantity of product to the consumers and
we're also making a much higher profit.

144
00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:16.370
Comparably to the previous
case of multiple consumers,

145
00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:21.640
we see that the optimal profit is
almost twice as high, and previously,

146
00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:26.850
we also sold a much lower quantity to
the consumers and couldn't do any better.

147
00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:30.030
The conclusion here is that
if we know a little bit,

148
00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:33.560
whether it's a single consumer or
a multiple consumer, and

149
00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:37.390
whether those consumers actually
want one item or two items,

150
00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:41.170
we can choose whether to sell them in
bundles, which will increase our profit.

151
00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:45.880
Or we need to price every item at the same
price for every consumer, and then, we

152
00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:50.770
cannot make use of the willingness to pay
to try and bundle those products together.
