00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.220
In this lecture what we're trying to do
is introduce parameters to the model or

2
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.820
try to see how a company can take into
account other things that change while

3
00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.830
it's taking actions, which is in
our example changing the price.

4
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.700
So let's try to see how a company
now can maximize its profit.

5
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.950
One thing to remember is that revenue,
which is how much money the company makes,

6
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:27.170
does not automatically translate into
profit because the company also has costs.

7
00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.480
Maybe some time it actually
cost more to produce an item

8
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.130
than the amount of money you
make if you sell it too cheaply.

9
00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.420
So, in this case, the company would
like to maximize it's profits, and

10
00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.660
he wants to make sure
that after paying for

11
00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.740
all of the production costs of the item,
it has money left in the bank.

12
00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.620
It actually can make money and
continue operating.

13
00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.950
So now we must take into
account the cost of the item.

14
00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.110
And the goal, as I said,

15
00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.770
is to maximize the profit,
which is revenues minus the costs.

16
00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.980
So let's introduce cost to the model.

17
00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.600
Suppose each product in the same
model we've discussed before,

18
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.600
costs $2 to produce.

19
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.350
What we can do is we can take the same
graph of revenue we created before, and

20
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.850
for each price point on
the x-axis we now add a point of

21
00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:21.790
the total cost it would cost us to produce
those amount of items we're setting.

22
00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.030
So, in this case,
you can see the red dotted line,

23
00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.880
this is the total cost
we're going to produce.

24
00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.260
Some interesting things we can see
in this graph is first of all,

25
00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.660
that if we sell the product too cheaply,
although the quantity may be high,

26
00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.700
the revenue is low, and it's actually
revenue is lower than the cost.

27
00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.160
We're actually going to loose some money.

28
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.760
One the left hand side, you can see that
the red dot is higher than the blue does,

29
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.630
where actually the profit
there is negative.

30
00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.580
Now if you look at towards the right hand
side of the graph when we're increasing

31
00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.680
price and the revenue,
the blue dots, go up and

32
00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.440
up, costs also go down because
the quantities we're setting go lower.

33
00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.100
And at some point, and
this is where the green arrow is,

34
00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.020
we're maximizing our profit,
which is basically the distance or

35
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.170
the difference between the revenues and
the cost.

36
00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.203
At that point, we're trying to find out
what is the price we'd like to send,

37
00:02:15.203 --> 00:02:18.430
we would like to sell the product for.

38
00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.600
How can we find this maximum profit?

39
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.750
In some cases, it's not very
convenient to use the revenue and

40
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.740
the cost graph I've shown you.

41
00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.440
And we can just take
the difference of them.

42
00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.270
We can take the same table I've shown
you in the previous lecture, and

43
00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.030
now calculate the cost,

44
00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.170
calculate the revenue, do revenue minus
the cost, and you will get a profit.

45
00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.950
In this case, we get a profit graph.

46
00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:47.620
And we can see that the price of roughly
$6.5 we're going to maximize the profit.

47
00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.360
However, it's a bit hard to tell
from this graph where the profit is.

48
00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.670
And also it's going to be very hard to do
it for a very big combination of prices.

49
00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.310
And one question I would like to ask is,
can we find a principle?

50
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.050
Can we find the way to find
where the maximum profit is

51
00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:08.320
without having to actually calculate
the profit and calculate those, and

52
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.390
draw these graphs for
every combination of prices?

53
00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.385
Now the answer is yes, and let's take
a look at what kind of forces or

54
00:03:17.385 --> 00:03:20.910
trade-offs operate in this profit graph.

55
00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.614
So what we're trying to see so,
if we can apply a principle,

56
00:03:24.614 --> 00:03:29.050
instead of drawing complex graphs or
using the table, that will apply and

57
00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.640
help us find the maximum profit
in any types of these problems.

58
00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.100
So let's take a look at the different
forces operating in this type of

59
00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.510
problem I've shown you in
the previous slide using the graph.

60
00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.530
One thing we notice is that selling too
cheaply yields a negative profit, okay?

61
00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.550
There's actually a maximum

62
00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:54.350
amount you want to sell in order to
make a profit from your company.

63
00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:59.890
The other thing is that the optimal price
we found that generates the maximum profit

64
00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.770
is different than the price we found that
generates the maximum revenue, right?

65
00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:08.270
Actually we needed to
increase the price slightly

66
00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:13.590
from $5.5 to $6.5 to get a higher profit.

67
00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.860
And the question is can we
actually use this principle?

68
00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:21.358
Do we actually need to increase the price,
in order to increase the profit,

69
00:04:21.358 --> 00:04:23.975
when we include costs in our model, right?

70
00:04:23.975 --> 00:04:27.311
Because in the revenue example
we assumed there's no cost, and

71
00:04:27.311 --> 00:04:31.139
when we introduced a profit and introduced
cost, now we see that we need to

72
00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:34.670
actually increase the price
to generate more profit.

73
00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:37.260
So let's try to understand
what does optimization do?

74
00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:42.430
What does this maximize
profit process actually do?

75
00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.470
And the idea is that we're actually
trying to change the price and

76
00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:50.890
increase it slowly, until the benefit
of the revenue doesn't go higher

77
00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:55.320
than the actual cost we're introducing,
by producing less or more items.

78
00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.920
So let's take a look at an example.

79
00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:03.658
What happens when we increase
the price from $1.5 to $2.0, okay?

80
00:05:03.658 --> 00:05:06.795
What we're going to see is, first of all,

81
00:05:06.795 --> 00:05:12.160
the revenue's going to increase
from $13.17 to $16.66.

82
00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.575
So the difference is going to be $3.49.

83
00:05:14.575 --> 00:05:17.360
We actually achieved a gain in revenue,
but

84
00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.100
also there is going to
be a decrease in costs.

85
00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.070
And why?

86
00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:24.530
We increased the price a little bit,
the quantity went down, and

87
00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:27.300
actually it costs us less
to produce the product.

88
00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:34.665
In this case, the cost went down by $0.9,
and the total gain in profit is $4.39.

89
00:05:34.665 --> 00:05:39.232
So actually we still have a positive
gain in profit if we increase

90
00:05:39.232 --> 00:05:41.952
the price from $1.5 to $2.0.

91
00:05:41.952 --> 00:05:45.090
Now what happens if we
increase the price too much?

92
00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:50.475
Let's take a look at what happens when
we increase the price from $6.5 To $7.0.

93
00:05:50.475 --> 00:05:53.070
We do the same calculation as before.

94
00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:55.740
Now the revenue actually decreases.

95
00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:00.120
It decreases from $27.82 to $26.81, so

96
00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:04.222
actually we have a loss
of revenue of $1.01.

97
00:06:04.222 --> 00:06:07.240
This is why we have a negative
sign in this slide.

98
00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.250
And also the costs go down because,

99
00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:14.150
again, when we increase the price,
the quantity goes down.

100
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:17.370
In this case, the cost goes down by $0.9.

101
00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:19.470
When we sum them up together or

102
00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:24.460
we take the difference to find revenue
minus the cost, we will see that actually

103
00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:29.490
we have a negative change in profit,
and we actually lost 11 cents.

104
00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:33.550
So in this case, we see if we
increase the price from a small

105
00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:37.780
price to a slightly higher price,
we have a positive gain in profit.

106
00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:41.700
And if we increase the price from
a very high price to even higher price,

107
00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:43.810
we have a negative gain in profit.

108
00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:47.400
And this leads us to the principle
we were looking, right?

109
00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:50.960
What we saw is that we're slowly
increasing the price in which

110
00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.690
we get a different increase or
decrease in profit.

111
00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:58.360
And the question is how far
should we increase the price and

112
00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.430
find optimal profit?

113
00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:04.769
How far or how high should we
set the price to say stop here?

114
00:07:04.769 --> 00:07:06.770
This is the optimal profit.

115
00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:10.690
And the idea is that you just increase
until the change in profit is 0,

116
00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:13.590
until it turns from positive to negative.

117
00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:15.740
And how can we find when this happens?

118
00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:18.970
We can look at the change in revenue,
like we've seen before.

119
00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:21.310
And we can look at the change in profit.

120
00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:26.540
And when they're equal, when the increase
in revenue equals the increase in cost,

121
00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:31.040
or the decrease in revenue equals
the decrease in cost, then we say,

122
00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:34.320
we need to stop here and
this is the optimal profit.

123
00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:38.970
This principle is called the marginal
revenue equals the marginal cost

124
00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:40.160
principle.

125
00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:45.790
Marginal revenue means by how much are we
increasing the revenue when we change

126
00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:49.150
the price of the item by one unit.

127
00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:53.530
And marginal cost means how much
is the increase in the cost

128
00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:57.630
when we change the price of
the item another one unit, and

129
00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:01.820
the change in those quantities
increase of decrease, okay?

130
00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:06.660
And this principle applies to many,
many types of profit maximization.

131
00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:10.822
So the previous slide, we've seen that
increasing the price from the low price to

132
00:08:10.822 --> 00:08:14.263
the slightly higher price actually
generates a positive profit and

133
00:08:14.263 --> 00:08:15.487
increases our profit.

134
00:08:15.487 --> 00:08:19.807
While increasing the price again from
a very high price to even higher price

135
00:08:19.807 --> 00:08:24.140
actually generates a negative profit and
decreases the profit.

136
00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:27.190
So the question is how
do we know when to stop?

137
00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:31.870
Should we start increasing the price,
and how can we find the optimal price?

138
00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:36.901
And the answer is well we need to increase
the price until the gain in profit is 0,

139
00:08:36.901 --> 00:08:37.710
right?

140
00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:42.270
Until we're moving from a positive
gain to a negative gain.

141
00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:46.330
Now how can we find that point easily
without actually trying to do the profit

142
00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:47.670
calculations?

143
00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:51.200
The answer is we can look at
the change in revenue, and

144
00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:53.970
see when it equals the change in cost.

145
00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:57.470
If the increase in revenue
equals the increase in cost,

146
00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:00.190
then we're not going to
have an additional profit.

147
00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:03.680
And also if the decrease in revenue
equals the decrease in cost,

148
00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:06.340
we're also not going to
have an additional profit.

149
00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:10.160
And this principle is called
the marginal revenue equals the marginal

150
00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:11.570
cost principle.

151
00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:15.970
The marginal revenue is the additional
revenue the company makes by selling

152
00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:16.940
one more item.

153
00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:20.770
By changing the quantity that it
sells from, let's say, one to two or

154
00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:25.280
three to four, or four to five, and
the marginal cost is the actual

155
00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:30.050
costs that the company needs to pay
in order to produce one more item.

156
00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:34.220
And what we can do is we can look at the
tables, we've seen a few slides before and

157
00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:37.090
actually take the differences
between every row.

158
00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:41.350
And say how much would it cost
me to sell one more item, or

159
00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:44.530
to sell two more items, or
to sell three more items?

160
00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:48.330
And also by how much would the cost
increase by sending one more item,

161
00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:50.910
or two more item, or three more items?

162
