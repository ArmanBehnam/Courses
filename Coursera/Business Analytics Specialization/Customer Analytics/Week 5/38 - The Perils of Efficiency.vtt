1
00:00:00.596 --> 00:00:03.740
The other part that I thought was
very interesting about some work

2
00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.500
we had done here is what's called
the traveling salesman problem.

3
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.900
Now this is probably a problem
that's not familiar to many of you.

4
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.120
But it's an old problem
that has been around since

5
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.130
the 1950s where a salesman has to
visit a bunch of different cities.

6
00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:18.400
So on the map of
the United States I'm showing you,

7
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.930
each of those red dots
represents a different

8
00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.020
city that a salesman who covers
the United States has to visit.

9
00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.420
And the traveling salesmen problem says,

10
00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.005
what's the shortest route the salesperson
can take to visit all of those cities.

11
00:00:31.005 --> 00:00:33.570
Cuz obviously the salesperson
doesn't wanna spend time traveling,

12
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.510
they wanna spend time visiting clients.

13
00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.920
So you might say what the hell does
this have to do with analytics and

14
00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.680
what does it have to do with retailing.

15
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.260
Well, it has everything to do with it.

16
00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.330
So what we were interested in is do
people who move more efficiently

17
00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.200
throughout a store,
do they buy more or less?

18
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.460
In other words,
do you want efficient shoppers, or

19
00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.540
do you want people that wander more?

20
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.310
And again, the reason back to my five
point framework, think about this.

21
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.490
This is data we never had before.

22
00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:03.080
So that's phase one.

23
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.770
Number two, we're now able to create
things like heat maps that allow us to

24
00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.670
explore the data, to look at what
fraction of the store is being cover.

25
00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:11.690
Step three,

26
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.800
now we're gonna analyze the data under the
framework of a traveling salesman problem.

27
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.670
And we're gonna look to see,
are certain types of shoppers,

28
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.110
people that are more efficient, in and

29
00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.310
out shoppers, are they more valuable to
the firm or less valuable to the firm?

30
00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.560
Step four, then I'm gonna talk to you
about who you should be targeting, and

31
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.390
step five, I'm gonna show you
about decision making of the firm.

32
00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.430
So this is a great example that has
all five points I was talking about.

33
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.250
So again,
did you can see here on this picture,

34
00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.310
let's imagine the green circles represent
the products that the person bought.

35
00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.130
The red line on this picture represents
the shortest possible path the person

36
00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.550
could have taken to pick up their cart,
buy those products, and check out.

37
00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.330
Now let's be clear, this is not
the path any given person took.

38
00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.570
This is the shortest possible path they
could have taken and we're interested in

39
00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.520
understanding are people that took shorter
paths or not, more valuable to the firm.

40
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.138
So for example,
the path on the A, if you like,

41
00:02:08.138 --> 00:02:10.836
person on the left hand
side of the picture here.

42
00:02:10.836 --> 00:02:13.482
This is a more efficient
shopper than person B.

43
00:02:13.482 --> 00:02:16.620
If you'd like,
person B got all wiggly and jiggly.

44
00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.920
Person B didn't just visit parts of the
store where he or she bought stuff, but

45
00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.150
did a lot of other
wandering around the store.

46
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.780
Now the question is, which custom
would you rather have, A or B?

47
00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.216
Obviously, before I flip to
the truth on the next couple slide,

48
00:02:30.216 --> 00:02:34.036
each of you should be thinking,
do you want to make things efficient for

49
00:02:34.036 --> 00:02:37.554
customers, or do you want people
to do some degree of wandering.

50
00:02:37.554 --> 00:02:43.608
So this is what's called a triangle plot
what's actually interesting here is that,

51
00:02:43.608 --> 00:02:48.496
you can see on the slide it says
the average TSP optimality is 28%.

52
00:02:48.496 --> 00:02:53.116
Now, what does that mean,
it means that about 75%

53
00:02:53.116 --> 00:02:57.600
of all movement inside
a store is not required.

54
00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.000
That means people could be spending
one-quarter essentially the amount of

55
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.500
time in the store and
still buy the goods that they bought.

56
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.180
Now the question is, is that good or bad?

57
00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.000
So what's neat in this triangle
plot is each of these dot

58
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.620
represents one of about a million
customers that we analyzed and

59
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.310
you can see here that on
the top we have TSP optimal.

60
00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.490
So if people were actually moving
in the shortest possible path

61
00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:23.878
you'd see all of these dots
at the top of this triangle.

62
00:03:23.878 --> 00:03:25.809
You don't.

63
00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:29.210
If the right travel deviation,
what does that mean?

64
00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:32.830
It means, for example, in a store, imagine
you should pick up the milk first and

65
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.500
then the cheese and the bread,
but you went bread, milk, cheese.

66
00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.320
That's called travel deviation.

67
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.035
That means you went in an efficient way,
but you went in the wrong order.

68
00:03:42.035 --> 00:03:47.046
So think about it as you
have to buy products A,

69
00:03:47.046 --> 00:03:52.196
B, and C, you should go ABC,
but you went CAB.

70
00:03:52.196 --> 00:03:53.273
That's order deviation.

71
00:03:53.273 --> 00:03:56.150
Then travel deviation has to
do with how much jiggliness.

72
00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.570
So I'm walking from the milk aisle to
the bread aisle, how much did I jiggle?

73
00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:02.050
How much did I wander off my optimal path?

74
00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.990
What you can see here is that most
people aren't optimal shoppers.

75
00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:11.416
And this last piece is now steps four and
five of the framework that I gave you.

76
00:04:11.416 --> 00:04:14.103
The key number is what I'm
telling you in yellow.

77
00:04:14.103 --> 00:04:18.870
Group 4 are people that
go in the wrong order.

78
00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.470
And they have the most jiggliness.

79
00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.350
And notice those people buy on average
about ten items every time they go to

80
00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.880
a store where the people that
are most efficient, which is group 1,

81
00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.010
only buy about half as much.

82
00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:35.240
So notice how I've turned new data,
which is where people go

83
00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.820
in the store, I've explored that data to
what parts of the store are most valuable.

84
00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.900
I've now taken that data and

85
00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.110
I've analyzed it through the traveling
salesperson model where I've now looked,

86
00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.900
now I can categorize each person as,
are they efficient in how much they

87
00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.570
jiggle between points A and B and
do they go in the right order?

88
00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:58.500
And now I've taken it to the action
step where I can see which customers

89
00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.790
are more valuable and it turns out, you
don't wanna rush people through the store,

90
00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:04.980
you don't want them to be that efficient.

91
00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.720
Now the challenge is,
you have to be able to identify

92
00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:13.060
which types of people are the more
jiggly types, and which people are not.

93
00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.350
Unfortunately, this shows you
a limitation in our dataset

94
00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.530
we didn't have demographics
about the people.

95
00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:21.950
So we didn't have age, race,
income, gender, urbanicity,

96
00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:24.490
do they live in the urban
neighborhood versus rural.

97
00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:29.360
If you did, you could then start
to say now I see who to target.

98
00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.680
Now I know what types
of customers to target.

99
00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.170
Unfortunately in this case,
we had good data.

100
00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:38.700
We had data on locations, and
we had the data on purchases, but

101
00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.906
we didn't have data on demographics.

102
00:05:40.906 --> 00:05:44.073
There's a great example of how,
without that information.

103
00:05:44.073 --> 00:05:45.860
I've come to a business decision.

104
00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.770
I need to find customers that
wander more around the store.

105
00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:49.420
That's great.

106
00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:50.890
That's nice to know.

107
00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:54.420
The next step would be, of course,
knowing who are those customers.

108
00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:55.350
What are their types?

109
00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:56.490
Can I identify them?

110
00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:58.900
Can I target them with
marketing in a different way?

111
00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.210
Cuz I'd rather have more of those customer
types than the other customer types.

112
00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:05.680
The next kind of data I'd
like to tell you about,

113
00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:10.000
which is again kind of the future of
marketing science, is eye camera data.

114
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.100
Now you might say, eye camera data?

115
00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:15.300
You mean people walking around
the stores with eye cameras on?

116
00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.470
Well, many of you may remember, and
you could call it a failure or not,

117
00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:23.645
on Google Glass, that was Google's
foray into the area of let's

118
00:06:23.645 --> 00:06:26.745
have people where glasses where everything
they're looking at is being tracked.

119
00:06:26.745 --> 00:06:28.730
Now if you had those glasses on,

120
00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:32.070
you could actually track where
people are looking in the store.

121
00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:35.370
We actually did a study of
over 1,000 people where we

122
00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:37.540
had them put on these types of glasses.

123
00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:40.490
And so this was an experiment,
it was a field experiment,

124
00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:44.640
where we actually put these glasses on
people and we track what they look at.

125
00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:48.130
And so you can see a picture of a person
on the left with this eye camera on.

126
00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:51.510
You can see on the right what it
looks like from the eye camera.

127
00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:53.730
And then,
the first thing we wanted to notice.

128
00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:55.320
And I've always wondered this question.

129
00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.220
But again without the right analytics and

130
00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:00.800
data, you could never answer it is,
if I'm showing you,

131
00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.390
let's say, an orange juice, what's called
the planogram of the orange juice,

132
00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:08.640
where the orange juice sits in the store,
where would you rather be in the store?

133
00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:11.640
Would you rather be up high like
six feet high at the top shelf?

134
00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:14.260
Would you rather be at the bottom shelf,
the middle shelf?

135
00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:19.070
Well, through eye tracking data and
analytics we can now answer this question.

136
00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:20.680
It actually turns out as you can see or

137
00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.720
think of this as a heat map
again red hot blue cold.

138
00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:28.650
Turns out the optimal height for
many product categories around 5 foot 6.

139
00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:30.280
You might say, well, why is that?

140
00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:33.490
Well, the average female
height is around 5 foot 6 and

141
00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:38.010
so in many supermarkets where 80
to 90% of the shoppers are female.

142
00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:39.480
You wanna put it at eye height.

143
00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:42.040
People don't like looking down,
people don't like looking up.

144
00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:43.391
People like looking at eye height.

145
00:07:43.391 --> 00:07:46.668
You may also notice in this picture
the left side of the planogram seems to be

146
00:07:46.668 --> 00:07:48.446
a little bit hotter than the right side.

147
00:07:48.446 --> 00:07:50.680
And you might say, wonder why that's true.

148
00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:53.260
Well, we read from left to right.

149
00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.520
So we scan from left to right.

150
00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:59.120
So, if you have a choice between being
on the right-hand side of the shelf or

151
00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:02.250
the left-hand side of the shelf, you wanna
be on the left-hand side of the shelf,

152
00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:05.100
because people,
when they walk up to an object,

153
00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:09.210
we scan from left to right cuz
we read from left to right.

154
00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:11.080
We scan at our eye level.

155
00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:15.440
And then sometimes we go up or down if
we don't find the product we want, so

156
00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:20.690
kind of, eye height level on the left-hand
side is the best place to be positioned in

157
00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:23.930
the store and many of you may be working
in industries where you have to pay for

158
00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:27.230
shelf space, so you wanna know
what the ideal shelf space is.

159
00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:30.340
It was through measuring
one customer at a time and

160
00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:33.530
looking at their eye data
that we were able to notice.

161
00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:37.670
For women it's about 5 foot 6, for
men it's about 5 foot 9, its left is

162
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:41.780
better than right, it's through analytics
that we were able to answer this question.

163
00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:45.100
So the other thing that was
interesting through this, and

164
00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:47.310
this is now to steps four and five.

165
00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:49.850
What's the business
implication of doing this?

166
00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:54.220
So, what I'm now showing you a picture of
is, on the X-axis here, since remember,

167
00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:57.370
we were able to remember what it
is you looked at on the shelf,

168
00:08:57.370 --> 00:09:02.050
not just what you bought, on the X-axis
you see three different variables.

169
00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:06.590
You see, did someone fixate,
look at the product for no times,

170
00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:11.340
they never looked at it,
once or twice or more.

171
00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:15.080
The thing we were interested in
is does in store marketing work?

172
00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:19.390
Are products that are looked
at more bought more?

173
00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:25.120
And what you can see here in the green
line, what we did was we measured people's

174
00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:28.120
fixations through their eye-tracking
device that was on their head,

175
00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:33.321
and we knew how many times you looked at
a given brand, zero, once, twice, or more.

176
00:09:33.321 --> 00:09:35.967
And then when you left the store,
we surveyed you and say,

177
00:09:35.967 --> 00:09:37.590
do you remember seeing that brand?

178
00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:39.840
Now let me say the good
news from the green line.

179
00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:43.440
More views upward sloping,
the more you look at something,

180
00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:45.570
the more you remember seeing it.

181
00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:49.259
I don't know, maybe I'm not gonna
wanna know about a prize for that, but

182
00:09:49.259 --> 00:09:53.126
no one had ever looked at that data
before, so recalls, meaning do you recall

183
00:09:53.126 --> 00:09:57.172
seeing the product, remember, that's
valuable data because just cuz your not

184
00:09:57.172 --> 00:10:00.713
gonna buy that today doesn't mean
your not gonna buy it in the future.

185
00:10:00.713 --> 00:10:02.987
More views, higher recall.

186
00:10:02.987 --> 00:10:04.446
How about consideration,

187
00:10:04.446 --> 00:10:08.100
we also asked people what
brands did you consider buying?

188
00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:10.910
Notice again, an upward sloping curve.

189
00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:14.540
The more you saw a product,
the more you consider buying it.

190
00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:16.950
So this is where things like
banner ads and other stuff,

191
00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:19.960
just putting your name out
in front of people over and

192
00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:24.340
over again not only raises recall,
but it raises consideration.

193
00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:27.860
And lastly, probably the one you might
care about the most is purchase.

194
00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:29.340
There is an upward slope in curve.

195
00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:30.600
It's a little bit flatter.

196
00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:32.200
And this is not surprising.

197
00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:38.390
Some people who view a product
a lot don't necessarily buy it, so

198
00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:43.605
recall and consideration are tremendously
affected by more views, choice less so.

199
00:10:43.605 --> 00:10:48.200
But again, this is the power of analytics
because now again you can start to

200
00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:53.180
say hey, I see there's potential long-run
value of different forms of advertising.

201
00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:54.010
It isn't just in choice.

202
00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:56.570
In fact,
choice may be the last thing to come.

203
00:10:56.570 --> 00:10:59.540
Recall and
consideration are gonna come very quickly,

204
00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:02.202
now that people have seen your ad,
seen your commercial.

205
00:11:02.202 --> 00:11:06.200
Now they're much more likely to
recall it and consider your product.

206
00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:09.900
Hopefully, if your product has good
benefits, people will actually buy it.

207
00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:14.165
So again, this was a great study we did
using data at the individual customer

208
00:11:14.165 --> 00:11:15.642
level measured in store.

209
00:11:18.106 --> 00:11:20.289
So another thing that came from this,

210
00:11:20.289 --> 00:11:24.111
since we also had data on what
people planned to buy and unplanned,

211
00:11:24.111 --> 00:11:28.138
cuz remember from that first slide
I showed you on the in-store data,

212
00:11:28.138 --> 00:11:32.255
we asked people before they went in
the store what do you plan on buying.

213
00:11:32.255 --> 00:11:35.828
It turns out, and
this is the part you can see here,

214
00:11:35.828 --> 00:11:39.754
4.9 out of 8.2 this the number
to me was shocking.

215
00:11:39.754 --> 00:11:44.018
60% of the things people bought in stores,
they went in and

216
00:11:44.018 --> 00:11:48.230
had no intention of buying
when they entered the store.

217
00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:50.370
Now again, how did we answer that through,

218
00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:52.860
when we go back to my
five point framework?

219
00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:57.733
We had data, we knew we wanted to
measure this, so we measured intentions

220
00:11:57.733 --> 00:12:02.466
before they entered the store and
we know what they bought in the store.

221
00:12:02.466 --> 00:12:06.122
It actually turned out that
an also in reverse 40% of

222
00:12:06.122 --> 00:12:10.100
the stuff they planned to buy,
they didn't actually buy.

223
00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:12.740
Now that's kind of a reinforcement
of marketing works.

224
00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:15.540
In other words, you don't always
buy what you intend to buy.

225
00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:19.960
This is a great example of how analytics
can affect in store marketing.

226
00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:23.580
The future of shopping.

227
00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:26.565
Many of you may have already
exhibited this at your local stores,

228
00:12:26.565 --> 00:12:28.030
supermarket stores etc.

229
00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:31.020
But if you don't know about it let
me tell you what's coming soon.

230
00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:33.140
It's something called a media cart.

231
00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:37.430
So imagine walking around your store where
you're putting your stuff in the basket

232
00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:42.400
and imagine the screen in front of you is
now giving you product recommendations.

233
00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.030
Like you just put pasta in the cart and

234
00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:47.820
it's saying,
sauce is two aisles down on the right.

235
00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:52.540
Or imagine you bought chips and you say
okay, where do I go get the beer now, and

236
00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:57.510
so imagine just like Amazon does
product recommendations on the web,

237
00:12:57.510 --> 00:13:02.940
imagine product recommendations in real
time based on your physical location and

238
00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:06.120
what you've put in the cart that's coming.

239
00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:09.730
Now, my research would say I
wonder if that's a good thing,

240
00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:12.060
since this may make people
more efficient shoppers and

241
00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:15.690
they may not buy more, but on the other
hand, it may make them come back

242
00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:18.990
to the store more often cuz they
can be more efficient shoppers.

243
00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:23.020
I think the future is wide open, but
you should expect to see things like media

244
00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:26.880
carts in the future, and helping you
if you'd like navigate around stores.
