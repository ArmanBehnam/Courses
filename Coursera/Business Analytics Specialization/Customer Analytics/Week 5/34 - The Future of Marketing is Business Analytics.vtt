00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.532
Like to welcome everyone to the guts and

2
00:00:02.532 --> 00:00:07.184
heart of our lecture on applications
of business analytics in marketing.

3
00:00:07.184 --> 00:00:11.812
I always like to teach stuff
right from the front slide.

4
00:00:11.812 --> 00:00:15.326
And if you notice here, the slide says
underneath the future of marketing and

5
00:00:15.326 --> 00:00:16.852
then in parenthesis, science.

6
00:00:16.852 --> 00:00:19.827
And the reason I say
this is because to me,

7
00:00:19.827 --> 00:00:23.315
the future of marketing
is business analytics.

8
00:00:23.315 --> 00:00:26.945
There's no firm today that should
be thinking purely mass marketing,

9
00:00:26.945 --> 00:00:31.369
there should be no firm today that isn't
thinking about individual level customers.

10
00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.053
There isn't any firm today that
shouldn't be using technology to measure

11
00:00:36.053 --> 00:00:40.292
their customers better and
the reason in parentheses science is now

12
00:00:40.292 --> 00:00:44.624
that you can measure stuff,
marketing really has become a science.

13
00:00:44.624 --> 00:00:46.592
Meaning, we have data.

14
00:00:46.592 --> 00:00:50.623
We talked about that in my introduction,
that's kind of the first step,

15
00:00:50.623 --> 00:00:52.255
what data have you captured?

16
00:00:52.255 --> 00:00:54.122
We have ways to explore that data.

17
00:00:54.122 --> 00:00:56.922
There's ways to explore
massive datasets today.

18
00:00:56.922 --> 00:00:59.535
Third thing,
we have models that we can build.

19
00:00:59.535 --> 00:01:02.734
We have ways we can optimize and
then we can make business decisions.

20
00:01:02.734 --> 00:01:05.370
To me, that sounds like a science.

21
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:10.077
And so again, the focus of this
lecture will be on applications of

22
00:01:10.077 --> 00:01:12.652
business analytics in marketing.

23
00:01:12.652 --> 00:01:13.445
The first,

24
00:01:13.445 --> 00:01:18.849
if you like question I always like to ask
is how do you compute corporate profits?

25
00:01:18.849 --> 00:01:21.873
Now you might say, well,
that's not a hard question.

26
00:01:21.873 --> 00:01:25.615
Revenues minus cost,
that's corporate profits.

27
00:01:25.615 --> 00:01:30.695
And I say, sort of, I mean, yes from
a finance perspective that might be right,

28
00:01:30.695 --> 00:01:33.859
but not from a marketing
analytics perspective.

29
00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:37.607
From a marketing analytics perspective,
you should be thinking not of,

30
00:01:37.607 --> 00:01:40.991
if you like, imagine a matrix where
the rows are your customers and

31
00:01:40.991 --> 00:01:43.045
the columns are the products they buy and

32
00:01:43.045 --> 00:01:46.691
the entries of the matrix are how much
did they spend on a given product.

33
00:01:46.691 --> 00:01:50.060
And of course, some of them can be zeroes,
they didn't buy any of the products.

34
00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.417
But if you wanna think about
it that way most people say,

35
00:01:53.417 --> 00:01:55.282
I'll just add up the columns.

36
00:01:55.282 --> 00:01:57.185
I'll see how much each product makes.

37
00:01:57.185 --> 00:01:59.994
I'll see what it costs to make
that product, and I'll compute

38
00:01:59.994 --> 00:02:03.825
corporate profits and a marketing view of
business analytics are just the opposite.

39
00:02:03.825 --> 00:02:05.787
The columns aren't your profit centers.

40
00:02:05.787 --> 00:02:09.664
The products aren't your profit centers,
but the rows are your profit centers.

41
00:02:09.664 --> 00:02:12.042
You should be thinking of each customer.

42
00:02:12.042 --> 00:02:14.155
How much should I sell to each customer?

43
00:02:14.155 --> 00:02:16.341
What does it cost me to
serve that customer?

44
00:02:16.341 --> 00:02:18.607
How much profit do I
make from each customer?

45
00:02:18.607 --> 00:02:20.175
And then I add up the rows.

46
00:02:20.175 --> 00:02:23.860
And hopefully, all of you guys remember,
it was probably eighth grade math for

47
00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:24.415
most of us.

48
00:02:24.415 --> 00:02:27.783
Whether you add up a table of
numbers from a columns or the rows,

49
00:02:27.783 --> 00:02:29.192
the sum is still the same.

50
00:02:29.192 --> 00:02:33.913
So the classic finance way of thinking
about profits is revenue minus cost.

51
00:02:33.913 --> 00:02:37.934
The classic business analytics and
marketing way of thinking about profits

52
00:02:37.934 --> 00:02:41.071
is how much revenue minus cost
do I get from each customer and

53
00:02:41.071 --> 00:02:43.229
let's add it up over all the customers.

54
00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:47.592
Now the advantage of thinking of marketing
analytics that way is that some customers

55
00:02:47.592 --> 00:02:49.240
have a negative value.

56
00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.006
What should you do?

57
00:02:50.006 --> 00:02:51.526
You fire those customers.

58
00:02:51.526 --> 00:02:55.920
Some customers have a lot of value to the
firm, those are the ones you have to not

59
00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.664
only cultivate and retain, but
you have to find tons more of them.

60
00:02:59.664 --> 00:03:02.522
So even just on this
first substantive slide,

61
00:03:02.522 --> 00:03:06.565
you can see in a way how the mindset
of marketing analytics works.

62
00:03:06.565 --> 00:03:09.605
It works one customer at a time.

63
00:03:09.605 --> 00:03:13.616
So again,
make profit one customer at a time.

64
00:03:13.616 --> 00:03:19.012
And that really is gonna be the underlying
theme for the rest of these slides,

65
00:03:19.012 --> 00:03:23.759
I'm gonna tell you how leading
firms like Google and Amazon, etc.

66
00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:27.607
Think about making one profit
one customer at a time and

67
00:03:27.607 --> 00:03:30.543
how really technology has changed that.

68
00:03:30.543 --> 00:03:34.185
So if you'd like, it's really
the intersection of technology,

69
00:03:34.185 --> 00:03:37.373
data and statistics that have
made business analytics and

70
00:03:37.373 --> 00:03:39.988
marketing kind of the science
that it is today.

71
00:03:39.988 --> 00:03:43.620
So let me just start with
what is customer analytics?

72
00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.136
And it might seem like an obvious
thing for many of you,

73
00:03:47.136 --> 00:03:50.893
it took us actually seven years
to write this definition.

74
00:03:50.893 --> 00:03:53.781
And you might say, wait,
you've been doing this for 20 years and

75
00:03:53.781 --> 00:03:56.071
it took you 7 years to write
what this definition is.

76
00:03:56.071 --> 00:03:58.908
And the answer is yes,
that is how long it took.

77
00:03:58.908 --> 00:04:00.978
But if you look at what we've said,

78
00:04:00.978 --> 00:04:03.740
customer analytics refers
to the collection.

79
00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:07.495
So first of all, you have to have data and
you have to collect it.

80
00:04:07.495 --> 00:04:09.802
As I said in my introduction,
if you don't measure it,

81
00:04:09.802 --> 00:04:11.382
it's almost like it didn't happen.

82
00:04:11.382 --> 00:04:13.590
Second is the management of the data.

83
00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.601
So there has to be someone that can
collect these data into large databases.

84
00:04:17.601 --> 00:04:20.876
And whether you store it in the cloud or
through to a server or locally,

85
00:04:20.876 --> 00:04:22.385
someone has to manage the data.

86
00:04:22.385 --> 00:04:24.272
You have to analyze the data.

87
00:04:24.272 --> 00:04:26.139
Data in itself is data.

88
00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:30.577
Data doesn't give you direct insights,
you have to analyze the data.

89
00:04:30.577 --> 00:04:34.353
And then finally,
it's the strategic leverage of that data.

90
00:04:34.353 --> 00:04:38.136
So customer analytics refers tot he
collection, management, analysis and

91
00:04:38.136 --> 00:04:42.152
strategic leverage of an organization's
granular data about the behavior of its

92
00:04:42.152 --> 00:04:42.808
customers.

93
00:04:42.808 --> 00:04:46.840
The other part that's key is the granular
nature of what I just talked about,

94
00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.198
which is again, going back to the though
about how you compute profits analytics.

95
00:04:51.198 --> 00:04:52.163
Business analytics.

96
00:04:52.163 --> 00:04:56.424
Customer analytics from a marketing
perspective is about granular data.

97
00:04:56.424 --> 00:04:59.843
Track every customer at
the most granular level.

98
00:04:59.843 --> 00:05:02.636
Next, you can see, again,
inherently granular.

99
00:05:02.636 --> 00:05:05.969
It focuses on individual level behavior,
not aggregate patterns.

100
00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:11.070
So the example that I love to use all the
time is if a firm wants to predict sales

101
00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:15.882
in some state, very interesting,
very important business problem.

102
00:05:15.882 --> 00:05:19.749
But that's not customer analytics, you
wanna compute it one customer at a time.

103
00:05:19.749 --> 00:05:21.775
Secondly, it's behavioral.

104
00:05:21.775 --> 00:05:25.408
The thing that's really changed 20
years ago when I started at DuPont and

105
00:05:25.408 --> 00:05:28.014
I was working in their
customer marketing division.

106
00:05:28.014 --> 00:05:31.096
When we wanted to know something
about customers, we surveyed them,

107
00:05:31.096 --> 00:05:32.360
we asked them what they did.

108
00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.685
But now, you can measure what they did.

109
00:05:34.685 --> 00:05:37.935
And the old marketing expression
is what predicts behavior in

110
00:05:37.935 --> 00:05:39.255
the future really well?

111
00:05:39.255 --> 00:05:40.716
Behavior in the past.

112
00:05:40.716 --> 00:05:45.421
Behavior predicts behavior a lot more than
what is called stated intention data fits

113
00:05:45.421 --> 00:05:46.092
behavior.

114
00:05:46.092 --> 00:05:47.661
Third, it's forward looking.

115
00:05:47.661 --> 00:05:51.943
I spoke about this in the introduction
when I gave that old marketing joke.

116
00:05:51.943 --> 00:05:56.027
Prediction's only hard when it's about
the future, but business analytics for

117
00:05:56.027 --> 00:05:58.108
marketing is a forward looking science.

118
00:05:58.108 --> 00:06:00.460
What are my customers going to do next?

119
00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:02.364
Next, it's multi-platform.

120
00:06:02.364 --> 00:06:05.742
So it's not just about what
you can measure on the web,

121
00:06:05.742 --> 00:06:09.574
it's integration of online,
offline, survey data, etc.

122
00:06:09.574 --> 00:06:10.393
If you'd like,

123
00:06:10.393 --> 00:06:14.262
the language you'll hear all the time
out there is the problem of data fusion.

124
00:06:14.262 --> 00:06:17.579
How do I fuse together data
from different platforms?

125
00:06:17.579 --> 00:06:20.453
All of that is part of
marketing customer analytics.

126
00:06:20.453 --> 00:06:22.064
It's broadly applicable.

127
00:06:22.064 --> 00:06:24.917
So notice the word customer is in quotes.

128
00:06:24.917 --> 00:06:27.121
So for example, if I'm Expedia,

129
00:06:27.121 --> 00:06:32.293
then a customer could be someone that goes
to my website and is looking for a trip.

130
00:06:32.293 --> 00:06:37.215
If I'm the American Red Cross, my customer
might be someone that donates to either

131
00:06:37.215 --> 00:06:39.690
a charity or someone that donates blood.

132
00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:42.879
If I'm a Pfizer like
a pharmaceutical company,

133
00:06:42.879 --> 00:06:47.957
my customer might be a physician or
might be a consumer, direct to consumer.

134
00:06:47.957 --> 00:06:50.762
So think of customer
in the most broad way.

135
00:06:50.762 --> 00:06:53.098
And finally, it's multidisciplinary.

136
00:06:53.098 --> 00:06:56.367
So if you're watching this Coursera course
and you're in a field of marketing,

137
00:06:56.367 --> 00:06:59.695
statistics, computer science,
information science, operations research.

138
00:06:59.695 --> 00:07:01.696
It's applicable to every
industry vertical.

139
00:07:01.696 --> 00:07:05.488
It's applicable to retail and
pharmaceutical, telecom, etc.

140
00:07:05.488 --> 00:07:10.665
The nice thing about the application
of customer analytics is that

141
00:07:10.665 --> 00:07:16.312
it knows no industry boundaries and
it really is cross-disciplinary.

142
00:07:16.312 --> 00:07:21.584
Just to say a few things for those of
you who wanna learn more about customer

143
00:07:21.584 --> 00:07:26.775
analytics in marketing besides just
it's application in this course,

144
00:07:26.775 --> 00:07:30.964
you can go to our website,
wcai.wharton.upenn.edu.

145
00:07:30.964 --> 00:07:33.343
This is a center my
colleague Pete Fader and

146
00:07:33.343 --> 00:07:36.977
I co-director on customer analytics and
you can take a look at how

147
00:07:36.977 --> 00:07:41.360
we've applied customer analytics to
many different industries and problems
