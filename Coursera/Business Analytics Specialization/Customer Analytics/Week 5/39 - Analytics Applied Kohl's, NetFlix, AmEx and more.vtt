00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.260
So the last part of the lecture I wanna
talk about today are some really cool

2
00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:10.340
applications of Advanced Management
Marketing Science by Leading Firms.

3
00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.615
And these are firms that are bringing
all five aspects together.

4
00:00:13.615 --> 00:00:16.515
They're using better data,
better exploratory methods,

5
00:00:16.515 --> 00:00:18.255
better predictive methods.

6
00:00:18.255 --> 00:00:22.725
They're using better optimization
to actually make business decisions

7
00:00:22.725 --> 00:00:25.000
that influence the products and
services they sell.

8
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.517
So let me start with the first one.

9
00:00:27.517 --> 00:00:30.357
Many of you may know
Kohl's Department Store.

10
00:00:30.357 --> 00:00:34.177
It's a very large national
chain department store,

11
00:00:34.177 --> 00:00:36.800
and kind of the low to
medium end department store.

12
00:00:37.967 --> 00:00:40.890
And by the way, remember from my
earlier slide this isn't Google,

13
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:41.850
Amazon or Facebook.

14
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.830
This is a brick and mortar retailer,
Kohl's doing the following.

15
00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.450
They're doing what's called
Smartphone Targeting.

16
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.451
So for example,

17
00:00:49.451 --> 00:00:53.677
they have data on your geospatial
location when you walk in the store.

18
00:00:53.677 --> 00:00:56.090
And you might say,
well how do they have that?

19
00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.310
Well, if you have your Wi-Fi
turned in on your cell phone.

20
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:00.670
Turned on on your cell phone.

21
00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.160
The minute you walk into the store and you
pick up the Wi-Fi network in that store.

22
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.420
It knows your geospatial location.

23
00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.160
So they're using their Wi-Fi network
to know your geospatial location.

24
00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.570
Everyone's cell phone has what's
called a fixed IP address, so

25
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.380
they can know it's you.

26
00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.125
They can now link that to what you've
done if you've gone on to their website

27
00:01:21.125 --> 00:01:22.910
kohls.com.

28
00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.870
Let's say they know that Eric Bradlow
was standing in front of the shoe aisle.

29
00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.520
They can now actually send
me a real time discount for

30
00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.310
shoes, whether through text or
it could even be a phone call.

31
00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.216
They can actually send me a real time
discount cuz I'm standing in front of

32
00:01:39.216 --> 00:01:40.107
the shoe aisle.

33
00:01:40.107 --> 00:01:44.610
So let's now reveal this in terms
of my five forces, if you like.

34
00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:45.670
Why can Kohl's do this?

35
00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.050
They have data that it's me through
my phone and the Wi-Fi network.

36
00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.640
They may have linked this hopefully,
to my behavior online and

37
00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.840
possibly through their data network and
online and offline in the store.

38
00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.260
They know physically where I'm standing.

39
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.660
And now, the action they are taking
is to send me a targeted or

40
00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.350
contextual discount given
my physical location.

41
00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.680
This is extremely valuable data.

42
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.660
There's the old adage in marketing,
it's not just selling the person the right

43
00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.700
product, it's the right product at
the right place at the right time.

44
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:18.830
Kohl's is taking advantage,

45
00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.360
that's what I'm saying, what's the better
time to send Eric Bradlow a men's shoe

46
00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.510
discount than when he's standing right
in front of the men's shoe aisle.

47
00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.110
It's not valuable 30 minutes before I get
to the store, it's not as valuable 30

48
00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.380
minutes after, it's valuable
right when I'm standing there.

49
00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.370
So this is an example of a company that's
recognizing they can collect better data.

50
00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:38.600
They can use that data for

51
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.464
decision making, and
they're gonna operationalize against it.

52
00:02:41.464 --> 00:02:44.332
Here's another one, Netflix.

53
00:02:44.332 --> 00:02:45.180
I think so

54
00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.480
many of us have become huge fans of
the content that Netflix is creating.

55
00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.450
As a matter of fact, for those of you who
don't know by 2020, there will be more

56
00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.520
video content consumed on
Netflix than any other provider

57
00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.840
that include YouTube,
that includes any broadcast at nbc.com.

58
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.770
Think about it Netflix the US
population will be watching more

59
00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:14.630
content on Netflix than any other
place in the world, that's amazing.

60
00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:19.170
Now, most people think well Netflix
is getting lucky in creating content.

61
00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.250
Not so fast.

62
00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.600
That's not true.

63
00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.250
So let me tell you what Netflix is doing.

64
00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.780
Netflix is doing what's called meta
tagging data meaning of course,

65
00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.210
when you log onto Netflix,
they know what you watch.

66
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.170
This is the ultimate
in customer analytics.

67
00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.690
They can measure customer by
customer what it is you're watching.

68
00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.540
But here's what they're also doing.

69
00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.290
Every show you watch gets what's called
meta tags or if you like attributes or

70
00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.310
descriptors.

71
00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.770
So they know if Eric Bradlow
watched a police show

72
00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:51.920
that takes place in the 1970s
in a warm weather city.

73
00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.470
So imagine having that corpus of data
from millions and millions of customers.

74
00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.910
Well now, rather than saying,
what show could we create?

75
00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.370
Now, imagine the director sitting there
saying, I see what the data's telling me.

76
00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:11.140
People really like police shows that take
place in warm weather cities in the 1970s.

77
00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.826
Hey, let's create a police show
from warm weather in the 1970s.

78
00:04:15.826 --> 00:04:21.195
And so what companies like Netflix
are doing is they're using data mining and

79
00:04:21.195 --> 00:04:25.090
customer analytic methods
to create content.

80
00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.860
And actually this reminds me of a project
I worked on ten years ago was how to

81
00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.940
optimally design ads of using attributes
of which ads were successful.

82
00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.460
And I remember getting a rude awakening.

83
00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.180
And this is maybe an idea before its time.

84
00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.860
I remember going to all the different
ad agencies and saying,

85
00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.530
you know what,
I know you use art to create ads.

86
00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:44.890
I got a scientific way for you to do it.

87
00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:46.800
I know how much music you
should have in an ad.

88
00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.340
I know whether you should
have dogs in an ad.

89
00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.170
I know whether you should
have kids in an ad.

90
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:54.300
I thought they would embrace me like,
Eric Bradlow you're the messiah.

91
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.400
Well, they weren't ready for
Science and Art.

92
00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.200
They were only ready for Art.

93
00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.850
I'm hoping things that
what Netflix are doing

94
00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:06.190
can bring more Science to
the problem of creation of content.

95
00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.700
Another example, American Express.

96
00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:14.210
Obviously one of the big problems American
Express faces today is churn modeling.

97
00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:17.390
They wanna know who's gonna give up
their American Express card, why?

98
00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:20.350
Well, one of the drivers that
you heard about in the other

99
00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:24.470
lectures of this marketing content was
the idea of customer lifetime value.

100
00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:26.128
I don't think I need to repeat, but

101
00:05:26.128 --> 00:05:29.351
I'll repeat briefly Churn is a big
part of customer lifetime value.

102
00:05:29.351 --> 00:05:31.499
If someone churned
through American Express,

103
00:05:31.499 --> 00:05:35.160
American Express makes no revenue
from them after they've churned.

104
00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.480
So you say well, what does
American Express need analytics for?

105
00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:41.340
You apply for an American Express card,
you fill out a lot of data.

106
00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:42.500
What's the problem?

107
00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:47.360
Well, there's no problem except when
American Express has found is that

108
00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:52.260
your social network data is a very
strong predictor of whether or

109
00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:53.910
not you're going to Churn.

110
00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:57.680
So what American Express is doing which
is what many firms are doing today.

111
00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.551
They're scraping, this is all legal.

112
00:05:59.551 --> 00:06:04.810
They're legally scraping data from the
World Wide Web of let's say, Eric Bradlow.

113
00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:08.627
Like what did I say on Facebook and
how many friends do I have?

114
00:06:08.627 --> 00:06:12.930
And what photos of my posting on Flickr,
and all this other kind of stuff.

115
00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:14.700
And they're taking that data and

116
00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:19.490
they're adding that as extra variables in
predicting whether I'm going to Churn.

117
00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:23.400
Like for example,
if I posted on Facebook today.

118
00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.820
Oh man, I'm broke and I just lost my job.

119
00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.260
That's probably pretty predictive
of whether I'm going to Churn or

120
00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.680
maybe not pay back my
American Express card.

121
00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:32.950
Probably pretty valuable for

122
00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:38.450
American Express to know that, so
this brings to bear a lot of issues.

123
00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:42.900
Better data, the company can manage and
collect that data.

124
00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:44.389
They can quantify that data,

125
00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:47.846
meaning they're using what are called
natural language processing

126
00:06:47.846 --> 00:06:51.614
techniques to take the textual data
from the stuff I've posted on the web.

127
00:06:51.614 --> 00:06:54.441
And they're turning that into
numerical data that they can fit

128
00:06:54.441 --> 00:06:56.280
into a numerical Churn model.

129
00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:59.260
That's remarkable to me
how far this has come.

130
00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.080
And again,
not only are companies doing this but

131
00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:03.490
you should know this as a customer.

132
00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:07.400
When you post stuff on the web, you should
know that companies are scraping this.

133
00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.940
As a matter of fact, it's not just
American Express that's doing this.

134
00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:13.850
The next person who that's thinking about
hiring you is scraping information from

135
00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:15.950
you about your social media usage, and

136
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:20.610
they're deciding whether you meet
their standards or not based on this.

137
00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:23.830
So this is very valuable data that
is now part of the analytics arena.

138
00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:27.720
The next example is in health care.

139
00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:31.370
While I'm not an expert in health care,
I am an expert in analytics.

140
00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:34.420
And the number one problem
in health care today,

141
00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:37.870
the two big problems in health care today
is number one, what it says on the right?

142
00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:39.200
Patient adherence.

143
00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:43.190
So how do you get patients to take the
medications that are prescribed to them?

144
00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:44.570
That's one big challenge.

145
00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:47.440
The second is what's called
predictive analytics and

146
00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:49.560
that's what I'm showing
you on the bottom before.

147
00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:52.630
If you think about the way medicine
works today, and why it costs so

148
00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:56.770
much to the government and to the planet
is because we wait till you get sick and

149
00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:58.720
then we treat you in the optimal way.

150
00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:01.680
But imagine I could predict
what from your medical records,

151
00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.580
which is the picture I'm
showing you on the left.

152
00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:07.010
Imagine I could predict
the illnesses you're going

153
00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:09.370
to get 20 years before you get them.

154
00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:14.560
Now, instead of trying to solve
the problem by treating you optimally,

155
00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:18.090
I try to prevent you from
getting this disease optimally.

156
00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:19.847
So imagine I knew that Eric Bradlow,

157
00:08:19.847 --> 00:08:22.110
I was gonna have high blood
pressure 20 years from now.

158
00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:25.360
Well why don't I start taking the drug
right now that prevents me from getting

159
00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:26.430
high blood pressure?

160
00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:31.370
And now, I've turned a reactive
problem into a pro active problem.

161
00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:35.620
And this is the future of
analytics in health care today.

162
00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:39.410
It's trying to predict peoples
diseases far in the future but

163
00:08:39.410 --> 00:08:42.640
if you think about what we've been
talked about when you watched me and

164
00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:45.640
my colleagues talk about,
this is analytics.

165
00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:47.630
This is marketing analytics.

166
00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:52.170
I'm gonna target individual customers
based on their patient records,

167
00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:56.435
based on what drugs they've taken,
based on their maybe family history,

168
00:08:56.435 --> 00:08:59.157
based on their consumption of goods and
services.

169
00:08:59.157 --> 00:09:03.785
I'm gonna target them optimally for the
right way to make them adhere to drugs,

170
00:09:03.785 --> 00:09:06.835
and with the right protocol to
prevent the future illnesses.

171
00:09:06.835 --> 00:09:09.005
This isn't backward looking,
it's forward looking.

172
00:09:10.255 --> 00:09:13.925
This is maybe one of my favorite
ones which is Google Free Taxi.

173
00:09:13.925 --> 00:09:16.405
If you haven't heard,
Google has been working for

174
00:09:16.405 --> 00:09:19.145
the last five years on driverless cars.

175
00:09:19.145 --> 00:09:22.730
Now you might say wow, that's kind of
interesting, that would be kind of cool.

176
00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:27.520
Yeah, but here's an opportunity that
they are thinking about to monetize it.

177
00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:30.850
So what you see on the left is just
an example of purchase history data.

178
00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:35.320
What you see on the right is a formula for
computing the customer lifetime value.

179
00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:39.680
Imagine Google doing the following, I'm
just picking Bloomingdale's as an example.

180
00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:44.010
Imagine I go onto bloomingdales.com and I
start saying, I like this and I like this,

181
00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:47.050
and I like this and I start thinking
about all kinds of stuff I wanna buy.

182
00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:49.210
Now, Bloomingdale's can measure this and
now I'd say,

183
00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:51.330
hey wait a second it's Bradlow,
Bradlow's back.

184
00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:53.290
He's a very valuable customer.

185
00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:56.540
Imagine Google partners with
Bloomingdale's and says wait a second,

186
00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:59.670
I understand Bradlow buying
online's valuable, but

187
00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:04.900
imagine we sent a driverless car over to
Eric Bradlow's house to pick him up and

188
00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:07.680
drive him to Bloomingdale's for free.

189
00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:13.280
So image Google partnering
with retailers to actually

190
00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:18.520
offer a free ride to a store based
on your customer lifetime value.

191
00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:21.910
This may be if you like
the Mount Rushmore of analytics.

192
00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:26.260
It's Google,
who kinda knows what you're doing,

193
00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:30.270
partnering with a brick and
mortar or an online retailer

194
00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:35.580
to send an actual car to your home
based on customer lifetime value.

195
00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:41.620
That has all the aspects of data capture,
kind of analysis

196
00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:45.980
prediction, and action which is
physically sending the car to your house.

197
00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:47.960
And if you think by the way
that this is fantasy and

198
00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:50.380
this is never coming, it's coming.

199
00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:51.370
In the next ten years,

200
00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:53.950
I guarantee you that not only will
there be driverless cars on the road,

201
00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:57.090
but there will be driverless cars on
the road that are tied to analytics.

202
00:10:58.480 --> 00:10:59.460
Starbucks.

203
00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:02.330
Starbucks is actually a much
more brilliant firm around

204
00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:04.850
analytics than people
give them credit for.

205
00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:09.323
And if you see here, I've given you these
two pictures which seem like an oxymoron,

206
00:11:09.323 --> 00:11:13.050
like they don't go together,
like customer loyalty equals no deal.

207
00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:14.810
What do you mean customer
loyalty equals no deal?

208
00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:17.690
I give the best deals to my customers,
to my better customers, right?

209
00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:20.920
No, that's not right.

210
00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:24.510
The people you should give the best
deals to are the people that giving them

211
00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:26.460
the deal changes their behavior.

212
00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:30.200
So let's imagine Eric Bradlow stops at
8 o'clock in the morning at Starbucks

213
00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:31.950
every single day.

214
00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:34.850
Do you think if they give me a deal
I'm gonna stop at Starbucks?

215
00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:37.910
How can I stop there more
than every single day?

216
00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:40.270
Maybe they can give me a deal
to get larger wallet share.

217
00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:43.460
Maybe instead of getting my muffin
at work and my coffee at Starbucks,

218
00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:44.830
I get both at Starbucks.

219
00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:47.450
But you don't give deals
to your best customers,

220
00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:51.120
you give deals to your customers for
which the ROI is the highest.

221
00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:54.580
And Starbucks recognizes this
through their loyalty program.

222
00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:58.242
They want to give deals to the people
right on the brink of being loyal.

223
00:11:58.242 --> 00:12:02.550
They wanna turn disloyal or
infrequent customers into frequent ones.

224
00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:05.170
They're not trying to turn frequent
customers into frequent customers cuz

225
00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:07.670
frequent customers are already
frequent customers.

226
00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:10.660
So they've taken analytics
to the next level.

227
00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:16.150
Where they recognize, you don't just treat
your highest revenue customers the best,

228
00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:18.230
you treat your customers the best for

229
00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:21.180
which the ROI of that
expenditure is the highest.

230
00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:25.080
And by the way, that's typically not
customers who buy the most from you.

231
00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:27.128
People get this wrong all the time.

232
00:12:27.128 --> 00:12:30.195
High value customers are already loyal,
they already buy a lot and

233
00:12:30.195 --> 00:12:33.340
you probably get a lot of their
dollar wallet share already.

234
00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:37.570
It's that interior customer, it's that
middling customer that you wanna tip

235
00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:40.800
towards a heavy buyer and
not towards a light buyer.

236
00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:43.510
Those are the ones you should target and
Starbucks knows this.

237
00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:47.377
The next one, Call Centers.

238
00:12:47.377 --> 00:12:48.877
A lot of you may not want to admit it,

239
00:12:48.877 --> 00:12:51.130
unfortunately you can't see me and
I can't see you.

240
00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:54.997
But a lot of you may not want to admit
this, but how many of you have ever called

241
00:12:54.997 --> 00:12:58.802
a company on the phone cuz you had a bad
experience with a product and started

242
00:12:58.802 --> 00:13:03.590
screaming into the phone or started
screaming at the person on the other line?

243
00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:06.250
I think everyone of us has to be
honest and say, we've done this.

244
00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:10.130
Now you might say,
what does this have to do with analytics?

245
00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:13.360
Well, it has everything to do with
analytics, and how marketing and

246
00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:15.010
sales are done today.

247
00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:18.360
Imagine Eric Bradlow calls on the phone,
let's imagine I call Comcast,

248
00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:19.640
my local provider.

249
00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:21.070
And I'm not saying anything.

250
00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:23.500
I like Comcast,
they're a good cable provider but

251
00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:27.310
lots of people call up that
they're upset with Comcast.

252
00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:29.490
And I'm not picking on Comcast.

253
00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:33.560
They know they have if you'd like, a
customer satisfaction issue with Comcast.

254
00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:35.300
Let's imagine I call up Comcast and

255
00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:39.000
I start screaming into the phone,
my cable service is out again,

256
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.540
the picture is blurry blah blah blah,
I start screaming at him.

257
00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:43.210
Well, two things.

258
00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:45.940
The first one is gonna be
not surprising to you.

259
00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:49.140
First of all, Comcast knows it's me that's
calling cuz I'm calling from my home.

260
00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:52.920
They can see I have ten TVs in my house
and by the way, I'm not exaggerating.

261
00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:54.190
I'm a TV family.

262
00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:55.026
I like TV.

263
00:13:55.026 --> 00:13:59.009
I have a lot of Comcast boxes which means
I'm a very valuable customer to Comcast,

264
00:13:59.009 --> 00:14:00.300
so they can see that.

265
00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:02.550
Notice already, look at the data.

266
00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:04.630
My phone is now linked to my account.

267
00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:05.620
They can see it's me.

268
00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:06.930
They don't ask me it's me.

269
00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:08.570
They know it's me when I call.

270
00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:12.670
And the person that's answering
the phone knows my lifetime value.

271
00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:16.530
They can see how much I've spent over
the last, my average monthly purchase.

272
00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:19.700
And they can see that I've
been a customer for 15 years.

273
00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:22.640
Second thing is,
they can listen to the intonation,

274
00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:27.150
software now can listen to the anger
in my voice and decide and

275
00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:31.910
put a script up there for
the person it went Bradlow, angry.

276
00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:33.620
Churn, not good.

277
00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:35.370
Gotta do something about this.

278
00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:39.630
And so here's an example where a firm
has taken really, natural language and

279
00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:45.330
intonation software and merged it with
CRM systems and database management and

280
00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:47.850
they're merging these together
they could do one of two things.

281
00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:49.320
One is, the script could be for
the person.

282
00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:50.930
Wait, calm down Mr. Bradley.

283
00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:52.700
We understand you're angry, etc.

284
00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:56.750
Or they could patch me through to a
different person who's better at handling

285
00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:57.990
angry people.

286
00:14:57.990 --> 00:15:01.410
And that's even a greater
possibility of using analytics.

287
00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:04.220
So here's an example of
a firm that's doing better

288
00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:06.400
customer relationship management.

289
00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:09.730
Call center routing,
if you like through the use of analytics.

290
00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:13.250
Amazon, ship before you buy.

291
00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:15.811
This is kind of again,
one of my favorite ones.

292
00:15:15.811 --> 00:15:18.272
You see a picture here again of
someone's purchase history and

293
00:15:18.272 --> 00:15:20.390
you can see a purchase for
a picture of a drone.

294
00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:23.640
No, I don't think Amazon's really gonna
have drones flying above my house,

295
00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:25.380
ready to drop a package off.

296
00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:27.360
But what Amazon can do.

297
00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:29.990
And I mentioned this briefly
in the introduction and

298
00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:32.700
a little bit in the summary
is what Amazon can do

299
00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:36.920
is they can predict what Eric Bradlow's
going to buy in advance of me buying it.

300
00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:39.410
They can ship it to a local
retailer near my house.

301
00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:42.950
And so if I order it,
I'm gonna get it that day.

302
00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:48.150
Imagine the possibility and the customer
lifetime value you can build by

303
00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:53.780
saying if you order by noon, the product
will be at your home today by 5 o'clock.

304
00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:56.180
Think about what you'd be
willing to pay for that.

305
00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:58.900
Now again, what allows Amazon to do this?

306
00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:01.850
Number one,
they've got really good data cuz they're

307
00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:04.380
tracking data at
the individual customer level.

308
00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:06.550
Two, they've got
a recommendation engine and

309
00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:08.310
they build it to do predictive modeling.

310
00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:10.890
So they can predict what Eric Bradlow's
gonna buy in the future.

311
00:16:10.890 --> 00:16:12.720
Not what Eric Bradlow bought in the past.

312
00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:14.740
What Eric Bradlow's going
to buy in the future.

313
00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:19.550
Number three,
they have extensive distribution.

314
00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:21.640
But to local retailers near my home.

315
00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:25.398
Number four, they have an ability
to act and charge for this.

316
00:16:25.398 --> 00:16:27.440
So are they gonna do it for
Eroc Bradlow for free?

317
00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:30.210
No, that'll be Amazon Prime Prime.

318
00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:35.030
Amazon Prime Prime won't be free shipping,
it might be free shipping but

319
00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:38.250
here's an extra price you
pay if you want it that day.

320
00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:43.500
And so imagine the power that analytics
has brought to these kinds of companies.

321
00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:48.461
So just to wrap up and to talk to you
about kind of the ultimate takeaways here.

322
00:16:48.461 --> 00:16:52.934
What I've tried to talk to you about
is technology meets management and

323
00:16:52.934 --> 00:16:54.700
marketing science.

324
00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:56.380
So what you should be focusing on,

325
00:16:56.380 --> 00:16:58.360
if you're sitting here
listening to this lecture.

326
00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:02.690
The first thing you should be thinking of
is technology's wonderful it's cool, but

327
00:17:02.690 --> 00:17:05.800
this isn't the thing about your
personal home use and devices.

328
00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:10.697
How can I use technology,
whether it's eye tracking data, GPS data,

329
00:17:10.697 --> 00:17:14.990
web data, purchase data, survey data,

330
00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:19.020
how can I use this data to
better understand my customer?

331
00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:22.070
The second,
it's never the golden age of data.

332
00:17:22.070 --> 00:17:26.250
So if you're still making decisions
today with store level data or

333
00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:30.540
aggregate data, you're probably giving
up a lot of money cuz there's data

334
00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:34.170
at a more granular level that's gonna
allow you to make the same decisions, but

335
00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:36.230
at the level of the individual customer.

336
00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:39.190
Third, if you think this
is nice to know stuff,

337
00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:40.910
I'm not in the nice to know business.

338
00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:45.250
If I had a dollar for every study that was
done that's nice to know, that's great.

339
00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:50.330
But I'm into problems and the way I
think of analytics is towards action.

340
00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:52.155
And this is real monetization.

341
00:17:52.155 --> 00:17:57.350
Do you think Kohl's, Google, Amazon
are doing this cuz this is nice to know.

342
00:17:57.350 --> 00:18:00.690
They're doing it cuz they see
a real opportunity to make money.

343
00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:02.780
So I want to thank you for your attention.

344
00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:06.270
Go on to my website,
go on to the customer analytics website.

345
00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:09.170
Don't ever stop learning
about analytics and

346
00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:11.470
how it can be applied to
your particular business?
