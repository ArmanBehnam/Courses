1
00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.810
Let me spend the next five or
ten minutes or so

2
00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:05.910
telling you about some radically
new data sets in marketing.

3
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.060
Cuz what I've talked to you about for
the first you know 20, 30 minutes or so

4
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.730
here, are kind of traditional TV data,
online data, etc.

5
00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.015
Let me talk to you about some radically
new data sets in marketing, and

6
00:00:17.015 --> 00:00:20.365
let me encourage everyone listening
to this to think about how

7
00:00:20.365 --> 00:00:24.415
you might be able to use these kinds of
data sets for better decision-making.

8
00:00:24.415 --> 00:00:29.390
So, one of the favorite studies that
I've talked about,and I'll talk

9
00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.740
about again in the future is, imagine
you could track the following data.

10
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.160
Imagine you could take data.

11
00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.560
Let's take a supermarket and a store.

12
00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.680
Imagine you could collect
data on people's intentions.

13
00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.850
So what did they intend to buy
prior to going into the store?

14
00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.330
Now why would you wanna know this?

15
00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.280
Well, then you could compare what
they intended to buy with what

16
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.890
they actually bought and then you could
see how much unplanned purchasing happens.

17
00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.450
Imagine you could collect
shopper path data and

18
00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.820
a radio-frequence identification data.

19
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.330
In other words you could track where
the customer is in the store, and

20
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:04.535
that's really valuable.

21
00:01:04.535 --> 00:01:07.150
Cuz again, let me go back to
the example I gave before.

22
00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.090
Let's imagine you're a manufacturer
of children's cereal, and

23
00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.500
the reason why your sales are low isn't
because your product isn't liked, but

24
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.610
because no one goes to the part of
the store where your product is located.

25
00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.160
Well, you can change that problem
by buying different shelf space and

26
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.666
moving your product throughout the store.

27
00:01:23.666 --> 00:01:28.110
Field of vision, imagine you can
actually have eye-tracking data;

28
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.145
where you can actually measure what
products people are looking at.

29
00:01:31.145 --> 00:01:34.220
Cuz imagine for example,
you're a soda, you make soda and

30
00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.580
your soda's sitting there on the shelf but
nobody looks at it.

31
00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.770
Well if they don't look
at it they can't buy it.

32
00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.450
And last is purchase data.

33
00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.230
So the exciting part about analytics
today is again, imagine having

34
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:49.660
all of these data sets at the individual
customer level and linked between them.

35
00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.800
So let me give you an example of a project
that I worked on about five years ago,

36
00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.800
along with my colleague Pete Fader and
a former doctoral student of ours, Sam Wi.

37
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.560
This was a data set called Path Tracker,

38
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.710
where we actually tracked
people moving around stores.

39
00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.020
And you can see a little
supermarket cart sitting there.

40
00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.490
And you can see these red concentric
circles moving out from there,

41
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.640
that's meant to represent a silent ping.

42
00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:16.480
You can't hear it.

43
00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.970
But it's a silent ping that's being sent
out to the different scanners around

44
00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.910
the store, that allows you to triangulate,

45
00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.000
within a foot, where the person
is located throughout the store.

46
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.410
And so, this is the kind of data sets
that are available today in application.

47
00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.900
Now five years ago when we
worked on this project,

48
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.020
this was done by attaching little devices
to the bottom of supermarket carts.

49
00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.410
That was the best technology.

50
00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.780
That was the golden age of
marketing in 2009, 2010.

51
00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.080
Now five years later, most of us,

52
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.280
if not all of us have cell
phones in their pocket, and

53
00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.320
you should know, your cell phone company
knows your geospatial location at any

54
00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:57.660
point in time and they can monetize
that value of the geospatial location.

55
00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.740
So let's imagine you have a data set where
you now not only know what people buy

56
00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.750
at the check out counter, remember going
back a few slides that was 1980s data,

57
00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.080
the scanner data, but

58
00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.640
now imagine I could know where
you were physically in the store.

59
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.550
And by the way, this isn't just for
physical in store data.

60
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.830
This could be applied to website data.

61
00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.645
I not only know what websites you went to,
but the time you went to those websites,

62
00:03:18.645 --> 00:03:20.675
how long you spent on those websites.

63
00:03:20.675 --> 00:03:23.375
Just think about this
as being spacial data.

64
00:03:23.375 --> 00:03:26.955
So, imagine a world where customers
could be tracked inside the store.

65
00:03:26.955 --> 00:03:29.480
So, this solid line you're
seeing now in front of you,

66
00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.480
that represents a customer's path,
one customer's path throughout the store.

67
00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.470
The little black squares you see represent

68
00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.380
their physical location
every five seconds.

69
00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.340
And the red squares
represent the products they

70
00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.970
purchased at various
locations in the store.

71
00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.540
And notice like most stores,
you pick up your cart on the right.

72
00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.180
You go around counter-clockwise,
and then you check out,

73
00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.420
which is typically at the end,
at the bottom, center of the store.

74
00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.840
So this would be a typical path
of someone throughout the store.

75
00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.080
How do shoppers move
throughout the store?,

76
00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.330
might be one question you're
interested in answering.

77
00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.430
I remember as a child,
this was well before I was born, but

78
00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.570
there was a famous show on, Leave it to
Beaver, which talked about a show that was

79
00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.920
taking place in the 1950s was meant
to be an all American family, and

80
00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.436
they always would show the person going up
and down the aisles of the supermarket.

81
00:04:19.436 --> 00:04:21.950
Up-down, up-down, up-down, up-down.

82
00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:25.800
It actually turns out, and actually it's
through analytics do we know this today,

83
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.000
it turns out that's actually not how
people move throughout the store.

84
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.570
People do not go up and
down the aisles, as a matter of fact if

85
00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.530
you go in one side of an aisle and go out
the other side that's called a traverse.

86
00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.050
If you go in one side of an aisle,
out the other side and

87
00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.865
back around the end cap that's called a
zig zag, where you go down let's say aisle

88
00:04:41.865 --> 00:04:45.250
five around and then up aisle six,
that's called a zig zag.

89
00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.150
It turns out most customers
make only one traverse,

90
00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.180
meaning they only go down an aisle once.

91
00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.510
It turns out most people do
what are called excursions,

92
00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:57.180
they go inside an aisle and
then out the same side they came in on.

93
00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.230
Most people do not go up and
down the aisles.

94
00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:02.770
And we now know this because of
analytics at the customer level.

95
00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:04.970
So this is not how people move.

96
00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:09.990
What I'm now showing you a picture of is
a store plan-o-gram where you can see

97
00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:11.260
where most people move.

98
00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.309
And notice in the center of the aisles,

99
00:05:13.309 --> 00:05:17.490
you can see the center here, nobody
ever goes to the center of the aisles.

100
00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:21.280
Most of the time people only go
to about a third of the way and

101
00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.030
then they come back out the same side.

102
00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:24.460
Now, why is that valuable?

103
00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:29.110
Well let me go back to my
emergency room doctor example.

104
00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.050
I'm a manufacturer of a product,

105
00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:34.780
I'm selling it inside a supermarket, my
sales aren't what I would like them to be.

106
00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:36.530
And now I start to wonder,
huh, I wonder why?

107
00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:39.260
I wonder if it's because people
don't like my product, or

108
00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.870
I wonder if it's cuz when people enter the
store, they don't ever visit my product.

109
00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.400
Well customer analytics
now allows you to do this.

110
00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:49.190
What you can see from this store level
layout is that people just don't

111
00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:51.170
go to the middle aisles that often.

112
00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:53.780
They pretty much only do on
what's called the racetrack, or

113
00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:55.200
the outer ring of the store.

114
00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:59.820
The almost never do in the interior
aisles, and the basic idea is that's bad

115
00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:05.640
shelf space, so you should not be paying
for shelf space where customers do not go.

116
00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:09.960
And as a matter of fact you can show that,
and we've analyzed data from thousands and

117
00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.270
thousands of different stores.

118
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:12.750
This may come as a surprise to you.

119
00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:16.875
In physical stores, super markets,
clothing stores, sporting goods stores,

120
00:06:16.875 --> 00:06:22.370
etc., most customers, on any given visit,
only cover about 25% of the store.

121
00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:27.900
That's remarkable, so 75% of the store
on any visit they do not go to.

122
00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:31.500
And that's an opportunity,
it would be valuable to know that.

123
00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:35.200
What I'm now showing you here is
what's called a heatmap of the store.

124
00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:39.830
Red is hot, green is not as hot,
but still pretty much hot,

125
00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:42.790
yellow is less hot, and then blue is cold.

126
00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:47.370
Notice where's really really cold,
the middle of the aisles, cold.

127
00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:51.510
The outer ring of the store, hot,
the race track, which is why you see firms

128
00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:56.290
paying lots of money for the outer ring of
the store, they want to be on the end cap,

129
00:06:56.290 --> 00:07:00.330
they want to be on the end aisles, and
by the way the only way you know this.

130
00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:00.830
No.

131
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:04.730
Could you actually have humans sitting in
the store watching where people are going

132
00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:05.350
and recording?

133
00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:06.350
You could.

134
00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:07.840
Very expensive.

135
00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:08.960
Can't be scaled.

136
00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.410
Measured with a lot of error.

137
00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:13.320
Could you put cameras in the store,
which has been done for years.

138
00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.640
You could, but it's very obtrusive.

139
00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:17.901
Now all the sudden people know
they're being watched and

140
00:07:17.901 --> 00:07:19.230
maybe they behave differently.

141
00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:23.680
Plus you have to take that video data and
you have to make it quantifiable.

142
00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:28.920
What customer level analytics has done is,
I can now track customer by customer

143
00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:33.900
where they go inside my physical store,
and I can actually tie that to their

144
00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:38.650
purchasing data, so now I can target them
even better with products and services.
