00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.250
So let me briefly, for the next five or
so minutes, tell you about some sample

2
00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.810
business problems that why people are so
exited about analytics.

3
00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:09.970
And then I'm gonna get into
kind of the heart and meat,

4
00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:12.830
which are some applications
of some firms today.

5
00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.415
So here's probably, as I travel around and

6
00:00:16.415 --> 00:00:20.535
talk to companies all over the world,
kind of one of the most important

7
00:00:20.535 --> 00:00:25.535
problems that people want to answer is
the advertising attribution problem.

8
00:00:25.535 --> 00:00:29.380
Or if you'd like, how much is
each piece of advertising worth?

9
00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.440
Or what is the ROI of advertising?

10
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.030
So imagine you're sitting here listening
to this marketing analytics course on

11
00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.720
Coursera, and imagine you say, I have

12
00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.290
a budget of $100,000 to spend on marketing
for my firm, do I wanna spend it on TV?

13
00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:43.530
Do I wanna spend it on radio?

14
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:44.820
Do I wanna spend it on banner ads?

15
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.800
Do I wanna spend it on
search engine marketing?

16
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.230
Well, how do you figure out
the ROI of each of these?

17
00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.870
And this is a classic example of
an applied area that people are spending

18
00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.520
a lot of time thinking about.

19
00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.510
Unfortunately, the state of the art out
there today or not the state of the art,

20
00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.590
kind of common practice out there
today is what's called last-click

21
00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.540
attribution which is wherever the last
thing you did, that gets you the credit.

22
00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.380
In other words, if the last
thing I did before I bought your

23
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.880
product was hear a radio ad, well, it
must have been the radio ad that did it.

24
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.180
But if you actually
think about that logic,

25
00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.910
what made you listen to that radio ad
as opposed to changing the station?

26
00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:24.130
Or let's imagine you see a banner ad, you
don't click on the banner ad and buy, but

27
00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.880
you click on the banner ad,
and then you buy a day later.

28
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.860
Or imagine you do a Google search,
if any, use your favorite search engine,

29
00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.960
imagine use a Google or Bing search, and

30
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.010
now all of a sudden, you know
the set of alternatives out there.

31
00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.120
And so what's really important for

32
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:44.060
attribution is understanding the entire
path of things that people are seeing.

33
00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.190
So here is an example of a data
set that I've worked on before.

34
00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.750
Let's actually start at the end of the
date set, and let's work our way forward.

35
00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.250
Imagine you have a conversion at a site.

36
00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.140
So for example, on the example I've
given you here is an automobile site.

37
00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.520
And so imagine someone has converted,

38
00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.170
meaning they've actually set up
an appointment to test drive a car.

39
00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.720
Unfortunately in the United States,
you can't actually buy a car online, but

40
00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.600
you can actually design your car, and
you can send that for a quote to a dealer.

41
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.950
They consider that a conversion, but
imagine I knew everything about your

42
00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.865
path that you did prior to converting
at the site, like I knew you went to

43
00:02:19.865 --> 00:02:23.870
Edmunds.com and viewed an ad,
I know you went to CNN.com, and

44
00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.830
you were targeted with an ad, I know you
went to Kelley's Blue Book and saw an ad.

45
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.400
I know you went to a Google search, then
I know you went to an advertiser's site,

46
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.860
and finally,
you actually converted at that site.

47
00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.070
And so at the end of the day,
last-click attribution would say give

48
00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:45.060
all the credit to the click-through at
Google, but that might not be right.

49
00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.150
All of those things, all the ads that you
saw before that may be what has led you to

50
00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.030
actually go to Google, do that search, go
to the advertiser, and eventually click.

51
00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.598
So again,
that's one of the most important problems.

52
00:02:58.598 --> 00:03:02.675
Another problem I loved studying was,
I actually spent about a year working on

53
00:03:02.675 --> 00:03:05.516
a project with ESPN,
the worldwide leader in sports,

54
00:03:05.516 --> 00:03:10.208
and one of the things, this had to do with
the 2010 World Cup, the soccer tournament,

55
00:03:10.208 --> 00:03:12.677
which was the largest,
as people know I think,

56
00:03:12.677 --> 00:03:16.970
the World Cup soccer is the most
broadcast and watched event in the world.

57
00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.970
And one of the events they wanted
to answer through analytics was,

58
00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:27.310
if they launch a mobile platform,
would that cannibalize their TV viewing,

59
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.030
and would it cannibalize
people streaming online, and

60
00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.940
would it cannibalize those
people going to ESPN.com?

61
00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.710
Now the reason that's an important
business problem, and I'm sure many of you

62
00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:40.800
face this problem as well, is if one
channel cannibalizes the other channel,

63
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.860
that may not be a bad thing if
the other channel's more profitable,

64
00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.930
but mobile ads are much less
valuable than other ads.

65
00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.310
You can charge a lot more for
TV ads than you can charge for mobile ads.

66
00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.610
And if mobile ads are cannibalizing,
then that's a bad thing.

67
00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.320
So this was a question
that ESPN wanted to know,

68
00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.709
if they launched a mobile channel to watch
the World Cup, would that cannibalize?

69
00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.430
This is the basic problem of
what's called GRPs in marketing,

70
00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.350
what are called Gross Rating Points.

71
00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:14.230
So the idea that ESPN wanted to understand
is they have two things in mind, reach,

72
00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.470
they wanna reach as many
customers as possible,

73
00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.410
in this case with World Cup content.

74
00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:23.140
And frequency, they want those customers
to watch as much content as possible.

75
00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:27.060
So reach is, if you like, what fraction of
households are gonna watch any content,

76
00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.320
and frequency is the volume of content.

77
00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.040
You multiply those things together,
you get GRPs.

78
00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:37.100
Now why does ESPN care about GRPs, because
they charge money for advertising and

79
00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:42.020
the more GRPs they have,
the more they can charge for advertising.

80
00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:48.400
So this was an analytics problems that was
how does the addition of another channel

81
00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:54.410
affect the total number of GRPs that
ESPN can serve, and here's the findings.

82
00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:59.190
It's one of those findings that's obvious
after the fact, but maybe not obvious

83
00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:04.215
beforehand, which is, yes, if you launch
a mobile channel for your firm, doesn't

84
00:05:04.215 --> 00:05:08.275
have to be ESPN, you will definitely
cannibalize your other channels.

85
00:05:08.275 --> 00:05:11.185
But let me just say, and by the way,
this could be mobile sales.

86
00:05:11.185 --> 00:05:14.160
If you sell more on mobile,
will you sell less online?

87
00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.290
The answer's probably, but
let me say two things about that.

88
00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:21.200
Number one, it's better for
you to cannibalize your own sales than for

89
00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.520
someone else to cannibalize your sales.

90
00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:28.400
And secondly, what they found is, even
though, and ESPN found this, and I have

91
00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:33.060
found this more generally true, through
analytics, even if the mobile channel does

92
00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:38.030
partly cannibalize your other channels,
the total volume actually goes up.

93
00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:43.380
And the way it worked for the ESPN World
Cup is there was intraday cannibalization,

94
00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.010
meaning, if I spend more time on
my mobile phone on a given day,

95
00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:49.860
I am gonna watch TV less on that day,
but overall,

96
00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:53.330
I'm giving you an additional
channel to engage with my firm.

97
00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.560
This is one of the really strong
application areas of analytics today is

98
00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.090
the fact that you can measure people
across multiple channels if you like.

99
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:07.890
TV, mobile, web, streaming video means
what matters is the total engagement.

100
00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:11.900
You don't worry as much about profit
maximization for each channel, and

101
00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:13.930
imagine the same thing is true in sales.

102
00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:16.950
If you have online and offline sales,
you shouldn't be worried about,

103
00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:20.620
well, if I launch online,
is that gonna cannibalize my store?

104
00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:21.390
Well, maybe.

105
00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:24.280
But what you should care about
is the total profitability, and

106
00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.330
it's the interplay between the two.

107
00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:31.720
And it's only through improved data and
analytics can you assess that problem.

108
00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:36.520
The next one is something as you know,
I'm a big golf fan, and so

109
00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.350
I spend a lot of time thinking of golf.

110
00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:42.100
And this is a question,
how valuable are price discounts?

111
00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:45.010
And I want to frame my answer
to this in the way of golf.

112
00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:49.410
But again, this is seminal question that's
being asked today through analytics.

113
00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:50.640
So here's an example.

114
00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:52.560
Obviously, my name is Eric.

115
00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:56.620
Imaging you send a price promotion
to Eric about playing golf, and

116
00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:59.990
let's imagine I'm a price sensitive
customer, so I golf more.

117
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.840
That's true.

118
00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:04.670
So one of the things you could do is, you
could measure the fraction of people or

119
00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:07.840
the number of people
you send coupons to for

120
00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:11.240
golf discounts, and
you could see whether they play golf more.

121
00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:14.700
My view view is,
that's exactly the wrong answer and

122
00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:17.040
will underestimate
the effect of discounts.

123
00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:18.550
Now the question is why?

124
00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:21.810
Well, most people don't
golf by themselves.

125
00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:26.420
So for example, if you send me a discount
for golf, I might play golf more, and

126
00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:28.690
then I'm gonna call three
of my friends up and say,

127
00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:31.380
hey it's a foursome, let's all play golf.

128
00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:35.420
Well, that initial coupon needs
to get the credit, not just for

129
00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:39.100
me playing golf more, but for
my friends playing golf more.

130
00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:41.700
And there was an empirical
study done about,

131
00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:44.955
if you like, the value of your social
network, and it was founded that about

132
00:07:44.955 --> 00:07:49.268
two-thirds of the value of discounts tends
to be for the person you send it to.

133
00:07:49.268 --> 00:07:53.290
But about one-third of that value is
by the friends that they talk to.

134
00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:55.240
Now, of course, how do you know that?

135
00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:58.360
You know that because you
would have to have data

136
00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:01.330
on who Eric talked to once you sent them.

137
00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:02.940
Now where do you get that data from?

138
00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:05.660
Well, you can collect that
information from Facebook today.

139
00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:08.720
There actually are firms out there,
I know this is gonna sound creepy,

140
00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:13.300
that you can put an app on your phone that
actually can measure your conversations.

141
00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:15.920
And of course, you know that
you're signing up for this app.

142
00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:18.960
But the ability to measure
word of mouth today

143
00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:23.320
gives us a much better view of
the value of marketing today.

144
00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:27.650
And again, there may be customers that are
more valuable than other customers, it's

145
00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:32.130
not just because they react to marketing
more, but because they tell more friends.

146
00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:34.290
In other words,
they not only internalize the marketing,

147
00:08:34.290 --> 00:08:36.350
they externalize it to their friends.

148
00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:41.430
So think about it, these problems of who
should I give the marketing credit to.

149
00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:46.400
Do channels cannibalize each other?

150
00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.130
And what's the value of a discount?

151
00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:51.470
These are seminal marketing problems,
that up until recently,

152
00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:55.880
through the collection of better data,
were unanswerable questions.

153
00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:57.420
You could answer them in aggregate, but

154
00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:59.610
you could never measure them
at the individual level.

155
00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:03.850
The last one I want to talk about
is what is the ROI of Facebook.

156
00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:07.530
And this probably is a problem
many of you are dealing with.

157
00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:10.660
In other words, is more likes or
mentions valuable?

158
00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:13.810
And the way I always like to frame it is,
of course.

159
00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:16.130
Who wouldn't want their
product liked more?

160
00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:19.040
But I claim that's
the wrong business problem.

161
00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:21.500
And here's why it's
the wrong business problem.

162
00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:26.570
Because imagine instead of data set
where you not only have the likes,

163
00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:30.380
but you also have
the online ad someone saw.

164
00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:33.210
Imagine you also had
the television ad someone saw.

165
00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:36.650
Imagine you also had Facebook,
what they saw on Facebook, and

166
00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:38.580
imagine you also had purchase data.

167
00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:43.550
Well, if you run a regression of
purchase data on Facebook likes,

168
00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:49.330
I guarantee you, products that have more
likes on Facebook, will be bought more.

169
00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:50.690
But that's not the question,

170
00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:54.910
that's not why Facebook is worth,
as of today, 70 billion.

171
00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:59.930
It could be 75, 80 billion tomorrow,
is that most people believe that Facebook

172
00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:05.140
information contains data that online and
television don't tell you.

173
00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:09.490
So that means, if I run a regression of
trying to predict purchasing of online or

174
00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:13.030
television with also
including Facebook data,

175
00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:16.050
that Facebook would have a significant and
positive coefficient.

176
00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:20.280
That means even if I know how much you do
online, even if I know how much television

177
00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:24.800
ads you see, knowing how many
likes you saw on Facebook for

178
00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:28.800
a given product helps me
predict purchase data more so

179
00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:32.070
than just traditional online or
television advertising.

180
00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:36.860
That's the magic of customer
attribution and customer level data.

181
00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:41.600
If you have this data, you can start
to decompose, is it the banner ads,

182
00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:43.810
is it the television, is it Facebook?

183
00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:46.940
Over and over again from the data sets
that I've analyzed shown that actually

184
00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:50.990
Facebook does have predictive power above
and beyond just traditional advertising.

185
00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:54.180
But the only way to address that again,
is through better data.

186
00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:58.500
So again Facebook and online have
greater short-term effects, and

187
00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:00.660
this part's probably not that surprising.

188
00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:03.720
The part that's probably
interesting to you is viewing a TV

189
00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:05.580
ad has longer term effects.

190
00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:08.160
What I mean by that is,
if you see a Facebook ad and

191
00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:11.250
you see a like in your Facebook feed,
in your news feed,

192
00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:14.220
you're probably gonna say oh,
I'm glad my friend likes this product.

193
00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:17.360
But five, ten minutes later,
you're probably gonna forget about it.

194
00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:20.190
TV, on the other hand,
has a much longer effect.

195
00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:24.670
The part that's the most fascinating
to us is that markets are efficient.

196
00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:30.380
What I mean by that is if a television
ad costs a thousand times a Facebook ad,

197
00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:34.260
the economic value of a television
ad is a thousand times the economic

198
00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:35.470
value of a Facebook ad.

199
00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:40.160
Meaning, basically,
the amount you spend divided by the amount

200
00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:44.160
of impact is basically constant
across these different channels.

201
00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:47.040
And we were definitely surprised
that markets were efficient,

202
00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:49.000
we did not expect that to be the case.
