1
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.790
I'd like to welcome everybody to
the marketing analytics section of our

2
00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:05.720
Coursera course.

3
00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:06.770
My name's Eric Bradlow.

4
00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:09.970
I'm professor of marketing and
statistics here at the Wharton School, and

5
00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:13.925
I'm really excited to be with you and to
teach you really what I've been doing for

6
00:00:13.925 --> 00:00:15.765
the last 20 years.

7
00:00:15.765 --> 00:00:19.205
So what I get to talk about, being that
I'm the last person in the session,

8
00:00:19.205 --> 00:00:24.485
are the five major application areas of
analytics today in the field of marketing.

9
00:00:24.485 --> 00:00:27.685
And that's right, I get to talk to
you about the really cool stuff.

10
00:00:27.685 --> 00:00:29.355
What is Google doing with analytics?

11
00:00:29.355 --> 00:00:31.395
What is Amazon doing with analytics?

12
00:00:31.395 --> 00:00:32.565
What are big firms,

13
00:00:32.565 --> 00:00:35.450
other firms that you may not be
thinking about doing with analytics?

14
00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.260
And I get to spend some time
talking about my own research and

15
00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.590
what I've been doing with
analytics over the last 20 years.

16
00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.430
There will be basically a five part
structure to what I'm going to

17
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.320
talk to you about.

18
00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.580
The first and most important question, and

19
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.970
this is where everybody should start,
is the data.

20
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.922
If you don't have the right data, if you
don't have the individual level of data,

21
00:00:54.922 --> 00:00:56.851
then you can't do customer analytics.

22
00:00:56.851 --> 00:00:59.113
So part of what I want
to talk to you about is,

23
00:00:59.113 --> 00:01:02.552
how do you build the right
infrastructure collect the right data?

24
00:01:02.552 --> 00:01:05.410
The second part is exploring the data.

25
00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.760
A lot of want to rush and field, rush and

26
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.170
fit fancy statistical models,
I'm a statistician,

27
00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.020
I love fancy statistical models, but
it's never where you should start.

28
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.260
You should always start with basic
exploration of the data, and

29
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.160
I can always give you an example
from the days I spent at DuPont.

30
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.020
I spent three years as
a marketing person at DuPont.

31
00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.910
The first thing when I presented the
statistical model to one of my colleagues

32
00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.940
or my boss, he'd say, Eric, that's very
interesting, but can you show me something

33
00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.290
basic in the data that suggests
that this effect is actually real.

34
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.990
That's what I'm going
to talk to you about.

35
00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.110
The third part is prediction.

36
00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.330
So there's the old joke, the old adage,
prediction's only hard when you're

37
00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.030
talking about the future, but
that is what marketing people do.

38
00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.800
We make predictions about the future.

39
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.760
But the key, and this is what this module
is about, we do it one customer at a time.

40
00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.570
One of the old stories I like to tell is,
you know, if Sony pictures calls me on

41
00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.830
the phone and says about the Marvel film,
we want to predict how many people

42
00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.570
are going to watch Ant Man in
every state of the United States.

43
00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.330
I would say great topical problem,
really interesting problem, but

44
00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.046
that's not customer analytics.

45
00:02:12.046 --> 00:02:15.680
If you want to predict what each person's
going to do, how many of them are going to

46
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.357
see Ant Man, how many are going to see the
previous Marvel films, how many are going

47
00:02:19.357 --> 00:02:23.460
to see the future Marvel films,
that's a customer analytics problem.

48
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:28.530
And it's not just a motion picture studio
that has that problems, grocery stores,

49
00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.670
consulting firms, Amazon,

50
00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.190
Google, Facebook, all of these companies
have this type of prediction problem.

51
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.040
Then the fourth part of course is
predicting the future's nice, but

52
00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.120
optimizing the future is even better, and

53
00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.450
that's really why marketing has
now gotten a seat at the C-suite.

54
00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.990
Which is, we can now talk about
pricing for optimization.

55
00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.100
We can now talk about emailing for
optimization.

56
00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.710
We can talk about discounting for
optimization.

57
00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:53.670
Optimization.

58
00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.860
And so, once you have the right
business problem and the right data,

59
00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.290
you have explored the data, and you fit
a model, you want to optimize against it.

60
00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.800
Because that's firms goal, firms want
to maximize revenue and profitability.

61
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.450
And then of course,
the last piece is taking business action.

62
00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.630
And so, the nice thing about
going last in this module, and

63
00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.630
talking about applications and case
studies, is I can talk to you about how

64
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.250
firms have actually used analytics for
decision-making.

65
00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.000
And to be honest with you, this is really,
has been a 20 year journey for me.

66
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.480
It's been me working with
lots of different companies,

67
00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.390
lots of interesting problems.

68
00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.530
A lot of people again ask me, you know,
what's the difference between

69
00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.710
being a statistician out of marketing,
and I'm saying today, it's not either or.

70
00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.280
The one thing I always say is,
if you don't understand about

71
00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.930
business analytics and its application
to marketing, there's a cement

72
00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.440
ceiling sitting on top of you that you
cannot go beyond within a company.

73
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.970
And it doesn't matter whether you want to
be the CEO, the CIO, the CMO, the CFO,

74
00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:58.010
everybody needs to understand how to
make money one customer at a time,

75
00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.940
and I'm going to talk to you
about how firms are doing today.

76
00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.322
I'm really excited about it and
come join me for the journey.

77
00:04:06.802 --> 00:04:07.719
>> Good.
