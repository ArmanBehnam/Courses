1
00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:03.150
The way I always like to think about it.

2
00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:06.920
This is one of my favorite talks
that I've given maybe once or

3
00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:11.350
twice in the past is something I
called The Golden Age of Marketing.

4
00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:14.800
I remember 20 years ago,
again this is my pre-Dupont days.

5
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.740
This is when I was a college student
working in a marketing firm doing

6
00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:19.380
telemarketing.

7
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.820
So we were calling people on the phone,
and we're record the conversations.

8
00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.090
And we'd measure whether they'd respond,
or even pick up the phone.

9
00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.010
And we'd collect this database
of what we knew about people.

10
00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:31.320
And we thought man, oh man.

11
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.340
Imagine how far technology's come.

12
00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.280
Now we get to know,
we get to record the people.

13
00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.370
We could code what they've said.

14
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.260
We thought we had great data.

15
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.750
Well, if you went to a firm today and
said, hey, I've got good news for

16
00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.100
you, this is what you know
about your customers.

17
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.440
If you remember stage one of what I
talked about, phase one is the data.

18
00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.250
If you took the data from 20 years ago and

19
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.190
that was your data today,
you should be fired.

20
00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.410
It's not the best data today, and again,
when I wanna speak about the next five or

21
00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.030
so minutes, is that there's
always better data out there, but

22
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.000
don't get paralyzed by this idea
of waiting for the perfect data.

23
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.260
Because I always like to say
the perfect data is never coming.

24
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.550
You have to analyse the data you have, but

25
00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.060
don't throw away data
you could be collecting.

26
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.350
So again, technology is what's driven our
ability to collect data better and better.

27
00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.320
So again, just as a brief
outline I'm gonna first give you

28
00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.510
kind of a historical data in marketing.

29
00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.270
So what are the kinds,
thinking back to my five step program,

30
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.070
what are the kinds of datasets that
are available in marketing today?

31
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:42.090
Second, what are the most emerging
datasets in marketing today.

32
00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.270
And so, many of these will shock
you cuz I think if I told you

33
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.210
Google has amazing data you'd be like,
of course.

34
00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.040
Amazon, of course.

35
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.295
There are lots of companies you haven't
thought about that have amazing

36
00:01:52.295 --> 00:01:53.430
data today.

37
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.420
Then I wanna talk to you about
some really futuristic data,

38
00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.710
like mobile data, path data,
like where you are.

39
00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.990
So imagine a company knows
not just what you've done but

40
00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.730
where you are physically
standing when you did it.

41
00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:11.000
Another one that I've spent a lot of time
working on recently is eye tracking data.

42
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.180
So imagine a firm can know
not only what you bought or

43
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.590
what products you didn't buy, but
what you looked at and didn't look at, and

44
00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.980
we'll be talking about that in detail.

45
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.050
Next, predictive analytics.

46
00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.850
And this is kind of the third,
and the fourth parts, and

47
00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.230
the fifth parts of my framework where
I'm gonna talk to you about real firms

48
00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.670
that are doing real projects and
real predictive problems using analytics.

49
00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.790
And for the part that might shock and
amaze you is every example

50
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.150
I'm gonna show you at the end today is
not only real, but it's being done today.

51
00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.223
These aren't like 20/50
they're gonna launch this,

52
00:02:45.223 --> 00:02:47.520
they're actually using these today.

53
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.900
So if you think about the outline
that I've just presented to you,

54
00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.660
the first two parts talk about kind of,

55
00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.480
if you'd like, step one of what I
talked about in my introduction,

56
00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.790
which is what are the kinds of datasets
that are out there in marketing today?

57
00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.700
So hopefully for many of you watching and
listening to this,

58
00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.160
you can think, hey,
I could collect that kind of data.

59
00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.828
Why don't I reap the benefits
of this great data?

60
00:03:11.828 --> 00:03:16.160
Kinda part three will be talking about
what are kind of, if you'd like,

61
00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.678
futuristic datasets and
how those could be used.

62
00:03:18.678 --> 00:03:23.510
And part four, will be the application
of these by large firms today.

63
00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.485
So if we were sitting, I'll just
briefly give you a history lesson,

64
00:03:26.485 --> 00:03:29.515
you probably didn't think you're
gonna sign up for a Coursera course

65
00:03:29.515 --> 00:03:32.880
from the Wharton School on Marketing and
Analytics and get a history lesson.

66
00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.566
But I'm gonna give you a brief history
lesson of marketing in the 1950s and

67
00:03:37.566 --> 00:03:42.110
in the 1950s, if you like,
the golden age of data in the 1950s was,

68
00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.245
I would know what was
happening at each store.

69
00:03:45.245 --> 00:03:49.970
Now many of you may be sitting in jobs
today, where store level data is the kind

70
00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.000
of data you have, in other words,
that's the level of granularity you have.

71
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.820
Now, let me say the good news.

72
00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.250
The good news is many firms make
decisions at the store level.

73
00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.990
What prices should I charge in this store,

74
00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:03.220
what should I put on
the end cap in this store?

75
00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.180
What assortments should
I have in this store?

76
00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.050
And if that's the level of decision
making you have, then store level data,

77
00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:14.390
even though it's 60, 70 years old could
be fine for the decisions you have, but

78
00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.760
it doesn't allow you to
do customer analytics.

79
00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.060
Again, in the 1950s, the kind of
business questions you can answer was

80
00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.590
how do store level prices relate to sales?

81
00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.340
So imagine building a regression model
which was talked about in the earlier

82
00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.430
modules here on analytics, where if you
have sales as your outcome variable and

83
00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.170
prices as your input variables.

84
00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.470
Imagine building a regression trying
to predict sales from prices.

85
00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.120
Now if you have data at
the store level on prices,

86
00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.020
you can start thinking
about optimizing prices.

87
00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.710
What's the effectiveness of coupons?

88
00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.910
So you can imagine knowing in each store
how many coupons are redeemed at a given

89
00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:50.110
product category.

90
00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.550
And trying to understand
how much is bought.

91
00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.490
You could try to understand regional or
geographic differences.

92
00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.310
You could also understand the effect
of in-store promotion, but

93
00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:03.490
understand, these are all relevant
questions in 2015 and beyond.

94
00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.710
But in the 1950s,
cuz the data was at the store level,

95
00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.850
you couldn't do customer level analytics,
you could do store level analytics.

96
00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:14.230
And for many of you,
this still might be the relevant problem.

97
00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:19.690
My interest and my suggestion to you is,
push your firm towards collecting

98
00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:25.580
greater granular data, and move from store
level analytics to customer analytics.

99
00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:27.930
And again, this still leaves
a lot of money on the table.

100
00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.000
And the reason again is, making decisions
at the customer level versus the store

101
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.860
level, there's a big difference in the way
that you can monetize your data that way.

102
00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:41.120
In the 1960s and 70s,
kind of I say direct mail ruled the earth.

103
00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:46.250
And I say this with the greatest of
fondness because most marketing analytics,

104
00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:51.180
business analytics today, actually comes
out of the direct mail literature.

105
00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:55.760
So when I was a child growing up in
the 70s, you would get sent your home,

106
00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.420
I remember my parents would be sent
these types of mailers and flyers.

107
00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:02.440
And of course, the company knew which
mailers and flyers they sent you.

108
00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:03.090
As a matter of fact,

109
00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:07.100
they could vary it household by household
depending on what you bought in the past.

110
00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.310
If you'd like,
direct mailing in the 60s and

111
00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:15.080
70s was the beginning of customer, or
if you'd like household level analytics.

112
00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:16.590
They knew what you bought.

113
00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:21.330
They could control which flyer, or
which brochure, or catalog to send you.

114
00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.720
So they could do target
marketing if you'd like.

115
00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:25.500
They'd know your reaction to it.

116
00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:28.790
They could run an experiment, which was
talked about in the previous modules,

117
00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:32.510
when they could randomly assign different
households to receive different things.

118
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:34.180
And they could see the impact.

119
00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:38.490
Now of course, the downside of it
is they know what they sent you for

120
00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:41.730
this type of advertising,
but not other advertising.

121
00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:44.600
And they don't know what you
bought outside of their firm.

122
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:49.220
So kind of the new answerable business
questions in the 60s and 70s was,

123
00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:53.730
now you could relate prices,
individual-level prices to category and

124
00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:58.860
shopping behavior, but again all they
would know is the prices in their catalog.

125
00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:01.350
They could to try to measure
the impact of frequency and

126
00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:03.540
timing of catalogs on purchase behavior.

127
00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:04.520
So think about that.

128
00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:08.290
That was done in the 60s and 70s, think
about how relevant that still is today.

129
00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:10.110
A firm is sending out emails.

130
00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:12.230
What frequency should
they send them out with?

131
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:12.970
What timing?

132
00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:16.520
Like should they send them one day apart,
three days apart, five days apart?

133
00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:19.090
All of this comes from
the direct mail literature.

134
00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:23.339
Product assortment, maybe you send
the Bradle household, the thin catalog and

135
00:07:23.339 --> 00:07:25.850
you maybe send his neighbor
the thick catalog.

136
00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:29.382
So how does the assortment you
send people affect what they buy?

137
00:07:29.382 --> 00:07:33.420
And then finally, the type of advertising,
one of the beautiful things about customer

138
00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:37.670
or household level analytics, is you could
test different advertising messages.

139
00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:41.190
You could even test, should you have a red
background versus a blue background,

140
00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:44.530
should you have 16 point
font versus a 10 point font.

141
00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:48.240
One of my greatest quotes that I've
ever heard of all times was from one

142
00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:51.020
of my colleagues in the marketing
department here Jerry Wind.

143
00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:54.910
He said, only run experiments
if you want to know the answer.

144
00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:58.270
And so, to me direct mail from the 60s and

145
00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:02.230
70s laid out the five
point plan I talked about.

146
00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:05.130
They knew the kind of business
questions they wanted to answer.

147
00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:08.250
They knew that they could measure things
at the individual household level,

148
00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:09.910
at least what they sent to you.

149
00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:11.440
They knew they could vary things.

150
00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:12.880
They knew they could build models.

151
00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:14.940
They knew they could target people, and

152
00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:17.750
they could make make business
decisions on the basis of it.

153
00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:20.640
Now, of course, it leaves still a lot of
money on the table because they would know

154
00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:23.370
what you bought in their catalog, but
they wouldn't know what you bought at your

155
00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:27.050
grocery store,
what you bought at a big department store.

156
00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:30.950
All they would know was their vertical,
what did you buy at their.

157
00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:33.020
So they didn't even know what
you bought at your competitors.

158
00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:35.140
So things like dollar wallet share,
which are so

159
00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:37.950
important in customer lifetime value,
they wouldn't know.

160
00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:40.800
Now let's think about the 1980s.

161
00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:44.620
This was kind of what most people
consider modern marketing science, and

162
00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:47.290
the reason is because store scanners came.

163
00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:49.010
So we're all used to that today, but

164
00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:51.660
I remember a day when store
scanners didn't exist.

165
00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:54.400
So, you didn't go to a checkout
counter at a supermarket or

166
00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:56.810
store and everything was scanned.

167
00:08:56.810 --> 00:08:58.510
That wasn't the way it used to be.

168
00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:01.670
And so, except for
what's called diary panel data,

169
00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:04.570
you really didn't know what
individuals households bought.

170
00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:07.290
Now of course,
you have the most granular data.

171
00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:10.710
And again,
it's industry vertical agnostic.

172
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:12.150
Clothing stores have this.

173
00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:14.380
Sporting goods stores have this.

174
00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:16.010
Supermarkets have this.

175
00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:18.730
Everybody can track individual level data.

176
00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:23.360
Now the beauty also is, let me relate
this to two other very important topics,

177
00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:25.570
which is number one, loyalty programs.

178
00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:29.830
So, customers always think that loyalty
programs benefit them, and they do.

179
00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:34.490
But remember, the minute you show
your loyalty card at a supermarket,

180
00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:39.280
they know it's you, or the minute you pay
with your credit card, they know it's you.

181
00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:42.270
So now, they can create what's
called a panel dataset,

182
00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:44.660
where they're able to
measure you over time,

183
00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:48.300
which means they can do target marketing
for you over, towards you over time.

184
00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:51.700
So one of the things I always
talk about is loyalty programs,

185
00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:53.440
credit card data, etc.

186
00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:57.130
While you see it as a customer benefit,
and it definitely is, there's no

187
00:09:57.130 --> 00:10:01.440
question it benefits the firm cuz now they
can do customer analytics towards you.

188
00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:06.050
Because if you paid with cash every
time you went to the supermarket.

189
00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:07.730
How would they know it's you.

190
00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:08.880
They don't know it's you.

191
00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:10.610
You're paying with cash.

192
00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:13.690
They know what somebody bought but
they don't know it's you.

193
00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:17.510
The key to customer analytics
is linking behaviors over time.

194
00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:21.170
The scanners in the 1980s
allowed the beginning of this.

195
00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:24.817
So again, the 1980s is the beginning
of the modern age of marketing because

196
00:10:24.817 --> 00:10:27.550
number one, you could distribute
discounts at checkout.

197
00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:29.630
You could track customers over time.

198
00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:33.188
You could give people coupons, as a matter
of fact, that's still done today.

199
00:10:33.188 --> 00:10:37.000
A very well-known firm, Catalina, is kind
of the master in giving out coupons.

200
00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.010
That I buy Pampers diapers,
they give me a discount for Huggies, etc.

201
00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:45.610
And again, it gives me greater
knowledge of the in-store experience.

202
00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:50.180
Now again, this is great data but
it's still not the golden age of data.

203
00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:54.730
So imagine you had that data today,
you'd be missing one big piece and

204
00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:57.370
that's what I wanna talk about for
the 90s and 2000s and

205
00:10:57.370 --> 00:11:00.850
that's lead to the greatest insight and
that's really the internet.

206
00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:05.680
So the internet really has changed
the face of marketing but maybe not for

207
00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:06.930
the reason you think.

208
00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:09.380
The reason you might be thinking is well.

209
00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:10.680
Selling product.

210
00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:16.170
The internet, selling product over the web
has changed the face of marketing.

211
00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:20.090
And the answer is, you're right, it is
an alternative distribution channel, but

212
00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:22.160
actually, that's not the reason.

213
00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:25.380
Many people may not know this but,
let's take a pause here,

214
00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:28.050
I'll let you think about this to
yourself for two or three seconds.

215
00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:30.950
What fraction of goods in
the United States do you think are sold

216
00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:31.530
over the internet?

217
00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:35.650
So, this is me sitting in front here,
pausing for two or three seconds.

218
00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:38.760
Suppose I told you that it just hit 6%.

219
00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:41.730
Most people think that
number's much larger.

220
00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:44.940
So, from a customer analytics and
a marketing perspective,

221
00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:48.850
the internet isn't so
much a second channel to sell stuff.

222
00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:51.860
It's a way to measure
what you're looking at.

223
00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:55.310
To deliver you ads in
a very contextualized way.

224
00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:59.220
So I know you're on ford.com so
I can send you a car ad.

225
00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:02.660
I know you're on a particular website,
maybe a vacation site, so

226
00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:05.150
now I can now only show
you ads on that site, but

227
00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:10.020
I can re-target you later on with, hey, I
saw you looked at vacations in France and

228
00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:13.420
you're actually, it's ten minutes later or
even two days later and

229
00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:16.200
I'm still targeting you with ads for
vacations in France.

230
00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:22.060
The internet has allowed firms to do
the ultimate in customer analytics.

231
00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:24.760
I always like to think of
the internet as being kind of,

232
00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:27.760
now that you have internet
data as well as purchase data,

233
00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:31.370
if you have those fused together, I almost
think of this as an emergency room doctor

234
00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:33.870
which is you go into an emergency room,
you're bleeding.

235
00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:34.800
What does the doctor do?

236
00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:36.450
He wants to know why you're bleeding.

237
00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:38.270
Well my view is, if you're a firm and

238
00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:42.680
you're manufacturing a product, and
you wanna know what's driving your sales.

239
00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:45.080
I think you wanna know not only
what people are buying, and

240
00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:48.520
that scanner data from the 80s could
tell you, but you wanna know what

241
00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:52.300
products people are considering and
ones that they haven't chosen to buy.

242
00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:54.690
So internet fused together
with purchase data.

243
00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:59.070
If you'd like, take your weblog data and
fuse it together with your supermarket and

244
00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:00.670
store scanner data.

245
00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:03.970
Now you have a very good picture
of advertising and of course,

246
00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:07.758
if you can add the third piece which
is TV, which is starting to come.

247
00:13:07.758 --> 00:13:09.690
Now all of the sudden you
have an integrated view and

248
00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:13.460
the data that you really want on
costumers to do analytics towards them.

249
00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:17.970
So again, from internet data you can
track which pages they've gone to.

250
00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:20.924
Probably, the most important part
is which products they consider,

251
00:13:20.924 --> 00:13:24.190
cuz one of the ways I always like to
think about it is, imagine two scenarios.

252
00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:28.850
One scenario is you have low sales because
people considered your product and

253
00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:30.020
don't like it.

254
00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:33.990
Another one is you have low sales because
people didn't even consider your product.

255
00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:36.010
I'd rather have the latter
than the former.

256
00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:39.100
The former means everyone knows about
your product, they've considered it,

257
00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:40.200
but they don't like it.

258
00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:43.240
The latter means maybe you just need
to spend more money on advertising to

259
00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:48.150
generate awareness without the data on
what products people are considering,

260
00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:49.520
you don't know it.

261
00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:51.610
Targeting ads,
that's kind of the big part.

262
00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:55.095
As a matter of fact,
it's gone through its double hunt cycle.

263
00:13:55.095 --> 00:13:59.945
Back in the late 90s, early 2000s,
banner ads were kind of the rave and

264
00:13:59.945 --> 00:14:02.485
then in the mid 2000s they died
off cuz people said, well,

265
00:14:02.485 --> 00:14:05.155
they don't lead directly to click but
now they're kind of

266
00:14:05.155 --> 00:14:09.870
back cuz people realize they generate
awareness and they generate brand equity.

267
00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:13.080
Next, the internet allows you to link
the past experience so you can track

268
00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:16.550
people through their IP address, through
what their called cookies, their drop

269
00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:20.700
loyalty programs, and the last part, and
this is the part I wanna emphasize to you

270
00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:24.590
cuz part of this module that I've been
talking about is getting the right data.

271
00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:28.090
It's crucial that you find
a way to link your online and

272
00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:32.830
offline data together because a lot of
people now do what's called show-rooming.

273
00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:36.450
They go in the store, the physical store,
they look, and then buy online.

274
00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:39.070
A lot of people look online and
then buy offline.

275
00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:42.410
It's really important that
you link those two together.

276
00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:44.670
Loyalty programs are one way to do it.

277
00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:47.660
There's ways to do it by giving
people discounts and coupons,

278
00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:49.800
by recognizing themselves
when they go in the store.

279
00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:53.230
You gotta link the loyalty
card data to the online data.

280
00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:58.220
Many firms lose the ability to do
modern marketing customer analytics

281
00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:02.730
because they don't properly link their
online and offline data together.

282
00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:06.060
And if you'd like the explosion
of new data is here.

283
00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:08.750
So if you look at all the different names,
Google,

284
00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:14.020
Facebook, Twitter, Yahoo,
Tumblr, Flicker, etc.

285
00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:16.290
It's probably as no surprise.

286
00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:21.830
That all of these companies have great
data that firms wanna know about,

287
00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:24.370
but how about this set of firms?

288
00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:28.540
So for example, Expedia,
what data does Expedia have?

289
00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:32.750
Well, Expedia has every time
someone goes onto their site.

290
00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:37.500
And of course, notice whenever you want
Expedia they either make you log in or

291
00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:41.680
they say sign in as a new customer
cuz they wanna track you over time.

292
00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:46.880
Another example given here is Sirius
XM Radio, the satellite radio company.

293
00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:48.792
Of course,
they know your listening behavior.

294
00:15:48.792 --> 00:15:52.540
The wanna know, I wonder how people who
listen to certain types of music if

295
00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:55.940
they're more likely to cancel
their Sirius XM accounts.

296
00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:59.170
Imagine Hertz, the car rental company,

297
00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:02.500
one of the questions their interested
is what car are you gonna rent next?

298
00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:03.820
Can they upgrade you?

299
00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:06.890
What actually is common to
all of these companies, and

300
00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:09.470
you probably aren't thinking
about all these companies.

301
00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:14.450
All of these companies here make
profits one customer at a time.

302
00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:18.050
They all have individual level
data that they use to monetize.

303
00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:21.270
And they're all applying
customer analytics methods

304
00:16:21.270 --> 00:16:25.470
to try to make more money, and to try
to optimize their marketing against it.

305
00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:25.970
So
