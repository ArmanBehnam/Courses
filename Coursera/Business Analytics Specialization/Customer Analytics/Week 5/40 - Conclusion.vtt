00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.050
Well I hope everyone enjoyed
the content that I delivered to you.

2
00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:06.680
Just to remind you, I started with
this right from the opening and

3
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.810
I've done it entirely through the sides.

4
00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:13.760
Remember the five pronged attack,
to apply customer analytics to marketing.

5
00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.040
Number one,
it always starts with the data.

6
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.660
So one of the things I always talk about,

7
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.380
whether I'm talking to a large firm like
Google or Amazon or a small start up.

8
00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.330
You have to build your infrastructure
to collect the right data.

9
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.170
Or another way to think about it is,
in today's world of technology,

10
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.790
if you don't measure it,
it's like it never happened.

11
00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.660
And that really is the competitive
advantage of many firms today.

12
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.570
Better decisions through better data.

13
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.790
And this is why the statisticians like
myself, or the marketing analyst,

14
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.270
can't sit in some silo in the back
room where the CIO and the CFO

15
00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.240
are making one set of decisions, and
you're making another set of decisions.

16
00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:01.380
Without the right data, you can't make
better decisions through analytics.

17
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.370
Number 2, data exploration.

18
00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:09.200
While it's not just as I talked about
during the lectures to validate the fancy

19
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.410
statistical model, how about, you've
gotta figure out what you're looking for.

20
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.190
We've all heard the expression,
looking for

21
00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.520
a needle in a haystack,
or just flying blind.

22
00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.530
Well, without exploration of the data, you
might miss lots and lots of interesting

23
00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.470
insights, that you are statistical model
would never even tell you to look for.

24
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.130
This isn't a classroom setting.

25
00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.440
You have to apply these methods
to real problems, and sometimes,

26
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.290
you need to explore the data to
find out what might be interesting.

27
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.990
The third part,
building predictive models.

28
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.580
So, we talked about a lot of
different types of predictive models.

29
00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.280
Number one, churn models.

30
00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.630
Predicting when a customer's
going to leave you.

31
00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.710
A very important type of model.

32
00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.240
Most people might say,

33
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.530
it's really what led to
the blossoming of customer analytics.

34
00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.280
And this is whether it's in the insurance
industry and they wanna predict,

35
00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.760
literally, time of literal death.

36
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.630
Or you're working for a website and

37
00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.300
they wanna predict when you're
going to churn from the site.

38
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.100
Or even if you're Proctor and Gamble, and

39
00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.870
you wanna know when someone's gonna switch
from your brand to a competitor's brand.

40
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:14.290
Churn is one major area, where customer
analytics is applied in a predictive

41
00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.800
sense, cuz it's always about
churning in the future.

42
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.730
Another form of prediction
that we talked about is,

43
00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.450
prediction your dollar
value in the future.

44
00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.400
So a lot of people make the mistake of
saying, well, I'll look at the past year,

45
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.350
I'll take the average spend
that someone has made, and

46
00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.500
that'll be their spend in the future.

47
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.680
Well, maybe not.

48
00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.340
As a matter of fact, as we talked about,
you could make three predictions,

49
00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.010
all of which contradict with each other.

50
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.370
One is, well,
spending will go down over time,

51
00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.880
cuz someone gets very excited once they
start with you, and then they decline.

52
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:45.670
Maybe.

53
00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.760
Another prediction could be,
well, if someone stays with you,

54
00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.870
they're more loyal, and
then their spending would go up over time.

55
00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.410
That's another prediction.

56
00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.260
A third prediction would be,

57
00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.650
people that it's your job as the firm
to try to maximize that spending.

58
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.140
As a matter of fact,
I'm not a believer in number one,

59
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.280
that people are just
stationary as we talked about.

60
00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.640
I'm not a believer in number two, that
people just increase some sort of magic.

61
00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.260
It's your job to predict and
to optimize people's spending over time.

62
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.190
Number four, optimization.

63
00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.060
We talked about lots of
forms of optimization.

64
00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.250
The most common ones in marketing today,
price optimization.

65
00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.820
How do you set price customer by customer
to maximize the firm's profitability?

66
00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.690
Second, something very popular today.

67
00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:32.740
Advertising.

68
00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.690
How do you decide, who to advertise to,
with what cadence?

69
00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.230
All of that is very important.

70
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:39.310
Three.

71
00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.030
Email.

72
00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.250
How do you decide which
people to contact and when?

73
00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.120
All of these things are an important
part of a person's toolkit,

74
00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.350
who works in customer analytics.

75
00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.720
And last,
we talk about lots of firm decisions.

76
00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.130
Let me talk about and review,

77
00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.380
just my favorite one from
the lecture slides that you saw.

78
00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.310
Probably my favorite one is Amazon.

79
00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.290
So we all know about,
many of us know about Amazon Prime,

80
00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.320
where you not only get free shipping, but
they'll ship it to you in one to two days.

81
00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.670
But as you remember from
the example I gave you,

82
00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.790
how would you like it if Amazon could
ship to you by the end of the day?

83
00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.800
By the end of the given day,
if you order by noon,

84
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.379
they'll have the product to you by 5 PM.

85
00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:21.166
Now how do they do that?

86
00:04:21.166 --> 00:04:26.260
They predict what it is you're going
to buy, before you every buy it.

87
00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.120
Now, they're not gonna ship it
to your home before you buy it.

88
00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.910
That'd be a little creepy.

89
00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.990
But they can ship it locally
to near where you are, so

90
00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.870
that by the time you order it,
they're ready to ship it to you locally.

91
00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.070
So again, remember,

92
00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.990
if you wanna take anything away from this
module, remember the five basic forces.

93
00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.470
Better data.

94
00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.230
Explore the data.

95
00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:47.930
Predict the future.

96
00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.830
Optimize against the future and
make actual decisions using it.

97
00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.720
If you make empirically based decisions,
you'll be better off, and you'll better

98
00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:02.020
off in your boss's mind, and you'll
make better decisions in the future.

99
00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.940
Thank you, and
I hope you enjoyed this course.
