Hi I'm Geoff Garrett,

2
00:00:06.584 --> 00:00:08.000
the Dean of the Wharton School,

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.560
and I'm thrilled to introduce Wharton's Business Analytics specialization,

4
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.429
the first comprehensive set of online courses to

5
00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:20.870
teach you how to use big data to make better business decisions.

6
00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:22.420
In the 21st century,

7
00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.054
it's not what you know that matters,

8
00:00:25.054 --> 00:00:31.155
it's how you use what you know that will determine your success in business and in life.

9
00:00:31.155 --> 00:00:36.234
No business school is a better place than Wharton to help you take charge of information,

10
00:00:36.234 --> 00:00:38.070
not to be overwhelmed by it,

11
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.794
because no one does data and analysis better than the Wharton School.

12
00:00:42.794 --> 00:00:44.965
Our research is cutting edge,

13
00:00:44.965 --> 00:00:48.130
but we always have our eyes firmly focused

14
00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.950
on practical uses in the real world of business.

15
00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.429
Questions like "How can Analytics help you predict the future better?",

16
00:00:56.429 --> 00:01:00.039
"How can Analytics help you make better business decisions?",

17
00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:05.117
that's what Wharton's Business Analytics specialization is all about.

18
00:01:05.117 --> 00:01:10.465
No surprise from Wharton will teach you how to use financial analytic tools,

19
00:01:10.465 --> 00:01:14.975
but will also show you how to manage people through people analytics,

20
00:01:14.975 --> 00:01:20.049
will help you understand customers and markets through customer analytics,

21
00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:26.120
and will help you master logistics and supply chains through operation analytics.

22
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.805
The principles you'll learn are simple,

23
00:01:28.805 --> 00:01:30.859
but they are so powerful.

24
00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:32.680
These courses will feature some of

25
00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.700
Wharton's most acclaimed professors or leaders in their fields.

26
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.575
Major corporations take full advantage of their expertise.

27
00:01:41.575 --> 00:01:44.412
In this specialization, you can too.

28
00:01:44.412 --> 00:01:46.900
Nothing could be more valuable to

29
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.580
your business education than a Wharton Business Analytics specialization.

30
00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.980
Enroll now and you won't regret it.
