00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.210
Welcome to our course on 
customer analytics.

2
00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.545
I’m Pete Fader, professor of 
Marketing here at the Wharton school,

3
00:00:06.545 --> 00:00:09.520
and co-director of the Wharton Customer 
Analytics Initiative.

4
00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.000
Standing right here in Huntsman Hall
the main Wharton building

5
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.200
and I’m delighted to talk to you about
what’s coming up in this

6
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.970
customer analytics course.

7
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.270
The whole idea of customer analytics is a
relatively new concept

8
00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:27.056
While the overall idea of marketing has
been around forever, there are so many

9
00:00:27.056 --> 00:00:32.350
cool and challenging data structures and 
technologies and

10
00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:37.375
decisions that firms are making
and we really want to help you get an understanding of them.

11
00:00:37.375 --> 00:00:38.984
This is not going to be a technical course 

12
00:00:38.984 --> 00:00:41.146
we’re not going to tell you exactly 
how to do the math

13
00:00:41.146 --> 00:00:42.910
we want to make you conversant

14
00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.187
we want to help you understand
what some of these data structures are

15
00:00:47.187 --> 00:00:50.754
We’ll have a course on descriptive analytics
to lay out the basic data

16
00:00:50.754 --> 00:00:52.870
and the insights that come from them.

17
00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.340
Then we’ll have a course on predictive analytics
to help you understand new

18
00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.460
insights about customer behavior that
just would have been invisible before 
we had all this cool data 

19
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.520
or companies wouldn’t have 
started thinking about that stuff

20
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.130
And once we start having a window into what
our customer will be able to do in the future

21
00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.190
then we want to talk about 
prescriptive analytics

22
00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.230
How can a company actually make more money?

23
00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.970
How can a company potentially change the future?

24
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.250
by having some kind of idea of what 
it’s going to look like.

25
00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.870
And then we’ll finish up with some nice 
case studies and examples.

26
00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:28.290
Like I said, it’s a really exciting era 
in customer analytics

27
00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.370
We can’t teach you everything.
By the end of this course

28
00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.750
we want you to feel comfortable with the
vocabulary, the data structures

29
00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.960
some of the technologies
a little bit about the models

30
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.110
so as you hear people talk about all of this
customer analytics stuff

31
00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.870
you’ll be in a good spot with it

32
00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.210
and in a much better position to go 
deeper yourself.
