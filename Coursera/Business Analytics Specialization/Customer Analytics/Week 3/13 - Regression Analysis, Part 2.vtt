1
00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:05.655
So what do we see here?

2
00:00:05.655 --> 00:00:07.935
On the horizontal
axis, we have price.

3
00:00:07.935 --> 00:00:10.710
On the vertical axis, we
have demand in units.

4
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.185
In addition to the points
that you were seeing earlier,

5
00:00:13.185 --> 00:00:14.895
we also see a straight line.

6
00:00:14.895 --> 00:00:16.510
That's your regression line.

7
00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.805
That's basically capturing how
price is impacting demand.

8
00:00:20.805 --> 00:00:22.874
In particular if you notice,

9
00:00:22.874 --> 00:00:24.390
the coefficient in
front of price is

10
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.520
minus 0.9, what
does that tell you?

11
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.950
As price goes up by one dollar,

12
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.290
sales is expected to
come down by 0.9 units.

13
00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.000
The fact that it's negative
makes a lot of sense why?

14
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.255
As price goes up,

15
00:00:36.255 --> 00:00:38.220
sales is expected to come down.

16
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:39.915
What else do we see here?

17
00:00:39.915 --> 00:00:41.580
What the regression
line is predicting as

18
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.390
well is pretty much if
you price it at zero,

19
00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.360
close to free, about
10 units will be sold.

20
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.670
So that's what we get
doing the regression line.

21
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.440
What else do we see? We also

22
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.200
see something called an R-square.

23
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.740
That's a number that's
from zero to one.

24
00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.520
It captures basically how
good is your regression.

25
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.485
The closer that number is to one,

26
00:01:00.485 --> 00:01:02.585
the regression is
doing a good job of

27
00:01:02.585 --> 00:01:05.120
capturing how demand is
changing with price.

28
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.035
The closer that number is zero,

29
00:01:07.035 --> 00:01:08.480
unfortunately, the regression is

30
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.010
not doing a very good job.

31
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.855
What do we see here?
R-square is quite high.

32
00:01:12.855 --> 00:01:14.145
It's about 89 percent.

33
00:01:14.145 --> 00:01:15.900
That's a very high R-square.

34
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.550
Typical R-squares, 70 to

35
00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.780
80 percent, that's
reasonably high.

36
00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.160
What we can do from
here is now that we are

37
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.990
convinced that the regression is

38
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.790
doing a good job of understanding

39
00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.830
how demand is varying with price,

40
00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.905
we can start using this
regression to make predictions.

41
00:01:30.905 --> 00:01:33.065
That's what we're after.
What we're after is,

42
00:01:33.065 --> 00:01:36.310
how do we make demand
predictions at different prices?

43
00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.070
That's what we will do next.

44
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.635
So for doing that,

45
00:01:39.635 --> 00:01:41.485
we can take multiple steps.

46
00:01:41.485 --> 00:01:44.090
We start out by looking
at the regression line,

47
00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.620
which is what we
had shown earlier,

48
00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.020
and start inserting
different prices.

49
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.460
We can first take the prices

50
00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.275
that are already in our dataset,

51
00:01:51.275 --> 00:01:54.710
and compare how our predicted
regression line or making

52
00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.285
predictions from the regression

53
00:01:56.285 --> 00:01:58.645
is comparing with actual data.

54
00:01:58.645 --> 00:02:00.405
That's what is shown first.

55
00:02:00.405 --> 00:02:03.260
What we see here
is actual data and

56
00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:04.610
the predicted regression line

57
00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.125
are quite close to each other.

58
00:02:06.125 --> 00:02:08.210
It's not surprising, the R-square

59
00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:09.395
of the regression remember,

60
00:02:09.395 --> 00:02:10.700
which measures how good

61
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.785
that regression
is, is quite high.

62
00:02:12.785 --> 00:02:16.145
What we can also do is
to go one step further,

63
00:02:16.145 --> 00:02:18.050
and that's the power
of regression.

64
00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.760
We can also start looking at

65
00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.755
demand predictions at prices

66
00:02:21.755 --> 00:02:23.555
that were not there
in the dataset,

67
00:02:23.555 --> 00:02:25.360
and that's what I do next.

68
00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.570
Look at the prices
on the top right.

69
00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.425
When you look at those prices,

70
00:02:30.425 --> 00:02:33.290
these are prices that are
not there in the dataset.

71
00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:34.805
These are future prices.

72
00:02:34.805 --> 00:02:36.680
This is when a manager can start

73
00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.110
thinking about how
to use regression,

74
00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.390
make predictions of demand for

75
00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.105
prices that he has
not tested as yet.

76
00:02:44.105 --> 00:02:46.670
What we see here is that
regression can make

77
00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.460
predictions for demand
at those prices as well.

78
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.700
So that's the beauty
of regression.

79
00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.300
Looking at some data,

80
00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.400
we can start understanding how

81
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.835
quantitatively demand
relates to prices.

82
00:02:58.835 --> 00:03:02.290
Look at the fit of the
regression, that's to R-square.

83
00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.040
Once you convinced that

84
00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.765
the regression is
doing a good job,

85
00:03:05.765 --> 00:03:07.700
you can start using
that regression

86
00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.695
to make demand predictions.

87
00:03:09.695 --> 00:03:12.035
Once you can make
demand predictions,

88
00:03:12.035 --> 00:03:15.240
optimal prices are
just one step away,

89
00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.330
and the intuition
is the following.

90
00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.215
If you can make predictions
at different prices,

91
00:03:21.215 --> 00:03:23.210
we can start looking
at the revenue

92
00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:25.645
and profit at those
different prices.

93
00:03:25.645 --> 00:03:27.890
Once you can do that,
you can then start

94
00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.260
understanding what
price should be charged

95
00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.000
to make the maximum revenue or

96
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.195
maximum profit if you know
your underlying costs.

97
00:03:35.195 --> 00:03:37.040
So the beauty of regression is,

98
00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.050
we start from overall data.

99
00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.980
We start quantifying the
relationship between variables.

100
00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.330
Once we have that,

101
00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.060
we start looking at how to
make demand predictions.

102
00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.090
Next, you can start thinking
about optimal prices and

103
00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:51.320
varying prices to figure

104
00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.410
out what your demand
is going to be.

105
00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.630
What we just showed you
was a simple example using

106
00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.735
one dependent variable and
one independent variable.

107
00:03:59.735 --> 00:04:02.150
But of course, regression
can be expanded

108
00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.395
to cover multiple
independent variables.

109
00:04:05.395 --> 00:04:07.950
The general idea
is the following.

110
00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.130
Again, on the left-hand
side we have Y,

111
00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:11.825
which is your dependent variable.

112
00:04:11.825 --> 00:04:13.700
On the right-hand
side we have the Xs,

113
00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.565
which are your
independent variable.

114
00:04:15.565 --> 00:04:18.085
In the bottom of this
page you see an example.

115
00:04:18.085 --> 00:04:21.575
One can speculate that sales
is a function of price,

116
00:04:21.575 --> 00:04:23.390
but price might not
drive everything.

117
00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:25.805
It may be advertising,
it may be promotions.

118
00:04:25.805 --> 00:04:27.065
Regression can handle

119
00:04:27.065 --> 00:04:29.695
as many independent
variables as you want.

120
00:04:29.695 --> 00:04:31.950
The idea there is
exactly the same.

121
00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.550
What you're trying to do is
to look at a combination of

122
00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.205
variables on the
right-hand side, prices,

123
00:04:37.205 --> 00:04:38.780
advertising promotions,

124
00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.505
and look at the
relative impact of

125
00:04:40.505 --> 00:04:42.170
each one to see how much do they

126
00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:44.545
contribute to overall sales.

127
00:04:44.545 --> 00:04:47.135
Now, regression as I mentioned,

128
00:04:47.135 --> 00:04:50.315
is just one example of
making demand predictions.

129
00:04:50.315 --> 00:04:53.030
It's a great tool for
understanding drivers of demand,

130
00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.925
making demand predictions,
talking about optimal pricing.

131
00:04:55.925 --> 00:04:58.390
But there are many,
many other examples.

132
00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:00.440
So regression is one way.

133
00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.330
You can start thinking
about things like cart.

134
00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.750
You can start thinking about
things like neural networks,

135
00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:08.060
all of those predictive
analytic tools

136
00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:11.310
that Peter is going to cover
later on in this course.
