00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:08.020
Welcome back. I hope that

2
00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.150
rigorous content on regression

3
00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:12.460
and related techniques
makes sense to you.

4
00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:13.960
I hope it's pretty
clear now how we can

5
00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.865
take a bunch of data from,

6
00:00:15.865 --> 00:00:18.810
let's say, period 1,
whether it's, again,

7
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.235
past behavior,
marketing activities,

8
00:00:21.235 --> 00:00:23.095
competition, whatever,

9
00:00:23.095 --> 00:00:25.510
to predict something
about period 2.

10
00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:26.950
Whether it's the
number of purchases,

11
00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:29.315
whether someone stays
with us or not.

12
00:00:29.315 --> 00:00:32.455
It's really really important
to be able to do that.

13
00:00:32.455 --> 00:00:34.240
Unfortunately, those
techniques are

14
00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.020
common, they're very accessible.

15
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.880
You don't necessarily have
to have special software.

16
00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.715
You can do it in something as
simple as Microsoft Excel.

17
00:00:42.715 --> 00:00:44.320
In fact, I want to talk about

18
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.870
an example where
people were doing that

19
00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.820
thing long before they had

20
00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.660
any kind of computational
power that we have today,

21
00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.720
or even the rich data
that we have today.

22
00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.110
I want to take you back to

23
00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.260
the late 1960s, the early 1970s.

24
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.350
It was the dawn of what today

25
00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.720
we would know as
direct marketing.

26
00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.520
It really was when a lot of

27
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.115
these ideas of customer
analytics were born.

28
00:01:10.115 --> 00:01:12.380
It was the first time that
we really had any kind

29
00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.540
of granularity about what

30
00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.660
particular customers were
doing and a desire to

31
00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.040
know what each and every one of

32
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.200
those customers
would be doing next,

33
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.875
for how long, and
for how much money.

34
00:01:23.875 --> 00:01:25.760
So it became very important for

35
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.010
companies to come up
with what we like

36
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.025
to call KPIs, key
performance indicators.

37
00:01:32.025 --> 00:01:33.170
Can we look at

38
00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.055
some indicators of what people
had been doing in the past

39
00:01:37.055 --> 00:01:39.860
in order to make some
accurate statements

40
00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.090
about what they're likely
to do in the future.

41
00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.634
This is just a natural area

42
00:01:45.634 --> 00:01:48.220
to run something like
a regression model,

43
00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.970
and indeed, regression models

44
00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.770
were used for this
kind of purpose.

45
00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.560
But it wasn't, let's
just throw in tons and

46
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.805
tons and tons of data

47
00:01:55.805 --> 00:01:57.880
because part of it as
the data was limited,

48
00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.060
part of it, as I said, is that

49
00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.770
our computational
power was limited.

50
00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.210
So we have to think
very carefully.

51
00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.595
It was very very important
for us to come up with

52
00:02:04.595 --> 00:02:06.890
just a few measures
that would be fairly

53
00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.570
predictive of what customers

54
00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:10.085
would be worth in the future.

55
00:02:10.085 --> 00:02:13.115
So our forefathers
in direct marketing,

56
00:02:13.115 --> 00:02:14.660
they basically did the kinds

57
00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.265
of things we've been
talking about here.

58
00:02:16.265 --> 00:02:17.690
Let's take our dataset,

59
00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.640
let's chop it into two pieces,

60
00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.590
let's collect some
data from period

61
00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.630
1 to see which elements of

62
00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.550
that period 1 data would be

63
00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.775
most predictive of what
people did in period 2.

64
00:02:28.775 --> 00:02:30.695
In period 2 would be looking at,

65
00:02:30.695 --> 00:02:33.080
how many purchases
they made or what was

66
00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.825
the dollar value of
those customers?

67
00:02:35.825 --> 00:02:37.880
They ran lots of
models to try to find

68
00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.060
out which bits of data
were most predictive,

69
00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.750
and they'd do it over and

70
00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.970
over and over again on lots
of different datasets,

71
00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.080
for lots of different products,

72
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.790
lots of different geographies,

73
00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.530
lots of different
customer segments.

74
00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.990
Because we wanted
to find a few of

75
00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.920
those explanatory variables
that were pretty robust,

76
00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.400
that time and time again
would prove to be predictive.

77
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.920
This is where our forefathers in

78
00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.735
direct marketing came up
with the idea of R-F-M,

79
00:03:05.735 --> 00:03:09.500
recency, frequency,
monetary value.

80
00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.390
What they found time and time

81
00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.670
again back in the
'60s, early '70s,

82
00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.835
and we still see true today
here in the 21st century,

83
00:03:16.835 --> 00:03:19.970
is that you can give me
these three summary metrics.

84
00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.880
You give me recency,
frequency, monetary value.

85
00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.530
You tell me the last

86
00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.750
time that someone
made a purchase with

87
00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.490
me or did some other kind

88
00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:31.759
of economically
valuable activity,

89
00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:33.875
maybe they took a sales call.

90
00:03:33.875 --> 00:03:35.960
Maybe they visited the website.

91
00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.120
So they did something that

92
00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.230
suggests that they're going to

93
00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:40.720
become a more valuable customer.

94
00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.050
Generally, we're talking
about a purchase.

95
00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:44.910
So that's R, that's recency.

96
00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.730
Now tell me about frequency.

97
00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.220
Tell me how many
purchases they made or

98
00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.920
how many economically
beneficial activities

99
00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.635
they did over a set
period of time,

100
00:03:54.635 --> 00:03:56.695
let's say the last year or two,

101
00:03:56.695 --> 00:03:58.910
and third would be
monetary value.

102
00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.475
I think that's pretty
much self-explanatory.

103
00:04:01.475 --> 00:04:02.810
So when they did

104
00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.315
those economically
beneficial activities,

105
00:04:05.315 --> 00:04:07.190
what was the overall or

106
00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.850
the average monetary value of
each and every one of them?

107
00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.310
So if you can give me R-F-M,

108
00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.125
recency, frequency,
monetary value,

109
00:04:15.125 --> 00:04:17.690
I can make a very accurate
statement about what

110
00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.430
that customer's going to
be worth in period 2.

111
00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.340
Again, this was one of

112
00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:23.660
the first areas where

113
00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.950
regression analysis
was used in marketing.

114
00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.350
It was one of the first ways for

115
00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:28.925
folks in marketing to
say, "You know what,

116
00:04:28.925 --> 00:04:31.010
all of that data that
we've been collecting,

117
00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:33.025
not really sure
what to do with it,

118
00:04:33.025 --> 00:04:34.700
there's real value there.

119
00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.440
We can really predict stuff

120
00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.630
and then we can start to
change our business to take

121
00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:40.790
advantage of these insights about

122
00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:43.205
what's likely to
happen in the future,

123
00:04:43.205 --> 00:04:45.680
not just what happened
in the past."

124
00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.720
So I just want to
put RFM out there as

125
00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.015
just one very nice example

126
00:04:50.015 --> 00:04:52.730
of an application of

127
00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:54.680
the kinds of things that
[inaudible] was talking about.

128
00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.370
Now I want to go
one step further.

129
00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.890
So we can run these
regression models

130
00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:01.620
and we can take
whatever data we have.

131
00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.220
Again, we could start with
something as simple as RFM.

132
00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.610
We can bring in many
many more kinds

133
00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.380
of measures, much
more complicated,

134
00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.480
much more interesting,
and make statements

135
00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.720
about what's likely to
happen in period 2.

136
00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.240
Again, if all you're
interested in

137
00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.790
is making statements
about period two,

138
00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:21.580
how many purchases are going
to happen in the next year?

139
00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.200
Who's going to churn or not?

140
00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:27.205
Then regression type
models are fine.

141
00:05:27.205 --> 00:05:30.610
In fact, you can't do better
than regression type models,

142
00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:32.020
or different kinds of data

143
00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:33.865
mining that might be out there.

144
00:05:33.865 --> 00:05:36.880
But what happens when you
want to go beyond period two?

145
00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.100
What happens when you want
to make statements about

146
00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.635
period three, or period four?

147
00:05:41.635 --> 00:05:43.660
Or what happens if you want
to talk about something

148
00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:46.345
like customer lifetime value?

149
00:05:46.345 --> 00:05:49.075
But we don't want to limit
our statements just to what

150
00:05:49.075 --> 00:05:52.150
a particular customer is going
to do over the next year.

151
00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.850
But if we want to go out
there and acquire customers,

152
00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:57.160
if we want to figure out
what's the maximum amount

153
00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.230
that we should be willing
to spend on a customer,

154
00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:01.000
We can't limit ourselves just to

155
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.890
how much they're going to pay us,

156
00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:05.185
how much profits we'll get
from them in the next period,

157
00:06:05.185 --> 00:06:08.455
we need to project that
out way into the future.

158
00:06:08.455 --> 00:06:11.890
The problem is, regression
type models are

159
00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:15.655
fairly limited at their ability
to do that kind of thing.

160
00:06:15.655 --> 00:06:17.185
Let me try to explain why.

161
00:06:17.185 --> 00:06:20.815
Let's go back to the timeline
that I described before.

162
00:06:20.815 --> 00:06:23.605
We get all of this
data in period one

163
00:06:23.605 --> 00:06:26.800
to make a statement about
what we see in period two.

164
00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.780
We run a regression
model to predict

165
00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:30.865
sales as a function of;

166
00:06:30.865 --> 00:06:32.319
visits to the website,

167
00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:34.135
usage of social media,

168
00:06:34.135 --> 00:06:35.590
marketing activities,

169
00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:37.915
everything under the
sun, that's great.

170
00:06:37.915 --> 00:06:39.700
But what happens if we
want to make statements

171
00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:41.635
about period three?

172
00:06:41.635 --> 00:06:43.630
Well, if all you want to do is

173
00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:45.175
make statements
about period three,

174
00:06:45.175 --> 00:06:47.650
that's not so bad. You'll
say, "Wait a minute.

175
00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:50.650
I have this data on period two.

176
00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:54.490
Instead of using period two
as my dependent variable,

177
00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:57.595
that's the thing that I want
to explain in my regression,

178
00:06:57.595 --> 00:06:59.800
why don't I look at
period two and get

179
00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.395
my explanatory variables from it.

180
00:07:02.395 --> 00:07:04.959
Why don't I look at; the
visits to the website,

181
00:07:04.959 --> 00:07:07.315
the marketing touches, the RFM?

182
00:07:07.315 --> 00:07:08.860
I have period two,

183
00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:11.575
so let me take all the period
two data now to try to

184
00:07:11.575 --> 00:07:14.575
make a prediction about what
will happen in period three.

185
00:07:14.575 --> 00:07:16.885
Hey, I already ran my regression.

186
00:07:16.885 --> 00:07:18.789
So I have my regression
coefficients,

187
00:07:18.789 --> 00:07:20.350
I have all the outputs
and everything

188
00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:22.015
that rigor was talking about.

189
00:07:22.015 --> 00:07:24.670
So let me just jam in
my period two data

190
00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:26.100
into that regression and

191
00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:27.840
make statements about
period three. "

192
00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:30.990
You see, I can predict the
future and that's great.

193
00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:32.490
If you want to go
one statement at

194
00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:34.670
one period out, terrific.

195
00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:37.480
But what happens if you
want to go to period four?

196
00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:41.080
We don't have any data beyond
period two ,we don't have

197
00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:43.030
any x variables from period

198
00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:45.175
three in order to
predict period four,

199
00:07:45.175 --> 00:07:46.945
what are we going to do there?

200
00:07:46.945 --> 00:07:49.480
How far out into the
future can we go?

201
00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:52.165
The problem with
regression type models

202
00:07:52.165 --> 00:07:53.695
is that they're limited.

203
00:07:53.695 --> 00:07:55.600
That if you don't
have any data to

204
00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.895
use as inputs into the model,

205
00:07:57.895 --> 00:08:00.115
then you can't get the output.

206
00:08:00.115 --> 00:08:04.045
So no matter how long your
observation period might be,

207
00:08:04.045 --> 00:08:05.890
you're limited as far as how

208
00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:07.870
far into the future you
can make statements.

209
00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:12.265
Now, in many cases
this isn't a problem.

210
00:08:12.265 --> 00:08:15.490
For many kinds of decisions

211
00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:16.810
that the companies want to make,

212
00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:18.730
simply being able to
make statements about

213
00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:21.940
one maybe two periods
out, is perfectly fine.

214
00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:23.230
In fact, you might say that

215
00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:26.560
most decisions are
perfectly adequate

216
00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:28.210
and these limitations of

217
00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:31.705
regression aren't going to
be a problem, and I agree.

218
00:08:31.705 --> 00:08:33.565
But there are times,

219
00:08:33.565 --> 00:08:37.120
especially when we want to
ask when type questions,

220
00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:38.890
or long run type questions.

221
00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:42.235
Like I mentioned, customer
lifetime value already.

222
00:08:42.235 --> 00:08:44.770
It's one thing if we want
to make a statement about,

223
00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:46.870
''Is this customer
going to churn in

224
00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:48.910
the next period or not?''

225
00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:50.170
Regression models are going to be

226
00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:51.640
great for that kind of thing.

227
00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:53.590
But if we want to ask
a question instead,

228
00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:55.780
''When will this
customer churn?''

229
00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:58.015
Like if they survive
through the next period,

230
00:08:58.015 --> 00:09:00.490
how many more periods
will they survive?

231
00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:03.415
Regression won't
really work well,

232
00:09:03.415 --> 00:09:06.910
when we're projecting way
outside of the range of

233
00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:08.440
data that we had in

234
00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:11.500
the first place to run
the original model.

235
00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:14.410
So if we want to make these
longer run projections,

236
00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:16.675
and I'm going to keep
coming back to talk about

237
00:09:16.675 --> 00:09:20.680
customer lifetime value
as one very nice,

238
00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:23.440
very practical example
of something that we're

239
00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:26.425
going to want to do over
a longer period of time.

240
00:09:26.425 --> 00:09:28.510
Today, as firms start talking

241
00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:30.640
much more about
customer centricity,

242
00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:32.560
that we want to figure out
who the right customers

243
00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:33.850
are and we're willing to

244
00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:35.500
invest in them because
they're going to be

245
00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:37.765
so worth it in the long run,

246
00:09:37.765 --> 00:09:40.870
we need to have some
visibility into the long run.

247
00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:41.680
We need to be able to make

248
00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:43.570
these predictive statements about

249
00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:44.950
the long run in order to

250
00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:47.665
see if those investments
are justified.

251
00:09:47.665 --> 00:09:50.380
So there's much more interest
than ever to be able to

252
00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:53.125
make statements
beyond period two.

253
00:09:53.125 --> 00:09:54.685
So I want to talk about

254
00:09:54.685 --> 00:09:57.610
a very different kind
of modeling approach.

255
00:09:57.610 --> 00:10:01.660
It's not nearly as popular
as regression models are,

256
00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:04.560
but it's not necessarily
any more complicated.

257
00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:08.610
As our view to the future
goes further and further out,

258
00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:12.000
it becomes more and more
important to add this other kind

259
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.620
of modeling approach to

260
00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:16.420
your toolkit. That's
what we'll do next.
