1
00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:02.740
Okay, let's piece all this together here.

2
00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:06.919
So I gave you this data with a desire
to project what's gonna happen next.

3
00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:11.043
Now if you think about the regression
approach, what we might have done is

4
00:00:11.043 --> 00:00:14.979
we could have taken this data set and
we could have broken into pieces.

5
00:00:14.979 --> 00:00:18.443
And we could have said, lets look at
your data from the first half or say

6
00:00:18.443 --> 00:00:22.760
the first three years and try to predict
what you'll do in the second three years.

7
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.090
And we could run regression models.

8
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.690
We can use things like r and f, and
other measures if we had them available

9
00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:31.840
to predict how many donations
you make in the second half.

10
00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.610
And then we could take the results
of that regression and

11
00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.650
make statements about
the next three years.

12
00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:38.770
We can do that.

13
00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:43.080
And if all we wanted to do was to make
statements about one period in time

14
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.310
we would do that.

15
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.089
And that might do absolutely just fine.

16
00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:49.290
I would have no problem
with that whatsoever.

17
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.570
But what happens if we want to
make projections further out.

18
00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.940
We don't want to limit
ourselves to any one period.

19
00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.200
I wanna take all of that data,
all six years of that data for

20
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.980
each customer since they were acquired,
to make statements,

21
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.220
not just any one period, but
for the rest of eternity.

22
00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.514
So, this is the contrast between
a standard regression model,

23
00:01:10.514 --> 00:01:14.590
which again is spectacular,
if we wanna make statements at one period,

24
00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.450
versus what I'm gonna
call a probability model.

25
00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.550
To be able to tell more of a story about
what's happening below the surface

26
00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.270
in order to be able to answer
questions over a longer horizon.

27
00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.780
Perhaps at the expense of those immediate
short term horizon type questions.

28
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.390
So I wanna look a these zeroes and

29
00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.720
ones and
tell a story about what's driving them.

30
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.570
In some sense, regression is about

31
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.510
using whatever explanatory variables
you have to tell that story.

32
00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.310
It doesn't really let you
go below the surface of

33
00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:47.400
the data that you have available.

34
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.540
Well that's what I wanna do.

35
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.390
I wanna suggest that there's some
behavioral mechanism, something that we

36
00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.880
can't observe that's driving the yeses and
noes, that's driving the zeros and ones.

37
00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.810
I want to think of some kind of
process that people are using

38
00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.110
to determine whether to make a donation or
not in a given period of time.

39
00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.960
So let me just think about
the simplest process of all.

40
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.350
In other words, in regression very
often it's gonna be complicated.

41
00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:19.020
I'm gonna bring in marketing and the
economy and competition and demographics.

42
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.150
I wanna bring in as much
information as possible.

43
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.870
I wanna go to the opposite extreme.

44
00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.940
I wanna bring in none of
that information at all.

45
00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.560
Instead I'm gonna say that each
person's decision of whether or

46
00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.820
not to make a donation
is gonna be a coin flip.

47
00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.780
So let's just imagine,
heads I donate, tails I don't.

48
00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.910
Now, do you think that people
are truly pulling out coins and

49
00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.750
flipping them when it comes time to
making these kinds of decisions?

50
00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.060
Probably not.

51
00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.790
Almost surely not.

52
00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.150
What are they doing instead?

53
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.060
Well, I don't know.

54
00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.780
It's pretty complicated.

55
00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.450
It's gonna be a function of many,
many, many different things.

56
00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.030
Some of the things,
we can observe like market activity and

57
00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.815
social media and
competition and demographics.

58
00:03:06.815 --> 00:03:08.970
Yeah, some of that we can observe but
there's still so

59
00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.160
many things that we can observe.

60
00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.170
Just think about yourself when
you're making day to day decisions.

61
00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.500
Sometimes it's gonna depend on, you ran
out of orange juice in the morning so

62
00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.760
you had to run to the store and
you didn't plan to.

63
00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.130
Or your kid was sick.

64
00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.060
Or you just hired a new person at work.

65
00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.490
There's so many factors out there that
drive our decisions in subtle but

66
00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:29.090
powerful ways.

67
00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.890
My view is that the decisions
that we make are as if random,

68
00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.590
as if we're flipping a coin,
heads I do it, tails I don't.

69
00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.070
Again, I am not saying that literally, but
it's kind of like if you're at the top of

70
00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:45.120
a tall building and you're looking
at the people walking around.

71
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.940
They look like ants, right?

72
00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.590
Not only because they're small,
but because they look so

73
00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.690
random, like why is this person turning
left and why is that person turning right?

74
00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.370
Well, in their mind, there's probably good
reasons for everything they're doing, but

75
00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.350
we, as an outside observer,
can't see those reasons.

76
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.840
So rather than trying to say, well, let's
try to predict left or right as a function

77
00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.020
of the temperature, the humidity,
the wind speed, you can't do it.

78
00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.320
At some point,
the signal to noise ratio is so

79
00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:17.140
low that people are acting as if random.

80
00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.820
And so
I'm going all the way to that extreme,

81
00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.430
I'm gonna build this as if random
model of customer behavior.

82
00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.442
I'm gonna say that people
are flipping their coin,

83
00:04:26.442 --> 00:04:30.080
heads they make the purchase or
donation, tails they don't.

84
00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.519
But there's a catch, different
people are flipping different coins.

85
00:04:34.519 --> 00:04:37.380
It's not a 50-50 coin for everybody.

86
00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.079
Different people have different
kinds of propensities.

87
00:04:40.079 --> 00:04:44.499
So one person might have a coin that
comes up heads 10% of the time.

88
00:04:44.499 --> 00:04:48.600
One person might have a coin that
comes up heads 90% of the time.

89
00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.276
And so
it doesn't mean that like clockwork,

90
00:04:52.276 --> 00:04:57.319
one out of every ten opportunities
will happen as a purchase.

91
00:04:57.319 --> 00:05:02.106
But it means that if I were to watch you
over a long period of time, about 10% or

92
00:05:02.106 --> 00:05:03.900
90% of them would come up.

93
00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.620
I don't necessarily even care that
much about the specific pattern.

94
00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.630
I care more about just
the overall propensity.

95
00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:14.440
If I'm gonna watch you in the long run,
I just wanna have a pretty good sense

96
00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.040
about how many donations you're gonna
make in that long future period.

97
00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.970
So I have this coin that's
gonna capture that.

98
00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:26.400
And again, the real key is that
the coin varies across people.

99
00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.190
That coin can vary across people
in lots of different ways.

100
00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:32.680
You could think about lots of
different kinds of pictures

101
00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.870
that might capture how the coins vary.

102
00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:39.230
So if you look at this slide over here,
maybe that everyone has a fairly similar

103
00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:42.660
coin, with just a few people being lower,
a few people being higher.

104
00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:45.660
Or maybe most of the coins
are very headsy, that is,

105
00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:47.400
people are inclined to donate.

106
00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.990
Or maybe the coin is very tailsy and
most people are disinclined to donate.

107
00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:53.440
Or maybe we get a U-shaped curve where

108
00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.370
there's some people who are really
into it and some people who aren't.

109
00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.320
There can be lots of different shapes!

110
00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.560
And I'm not even gonna pick which one.

111
00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.920
I'm gonna try to pick appropriate
statistical distributions

112
00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.590
that can capture all
these different shapes.

113
00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:12.890
So just having the ability to capture
how people differ in their coin flips,

114
00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:16.140
in their purchasing propensities,
is gonna get me pretty far.

115
00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:20.040
But wait, if you think about the Mary and
Charmila story,

116
00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:25.380
it's not only knowing about the overall
propensity to make those donations, is it?

117
00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:29.410
We also have to know something about,
is this person alive or not?

118
00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:33.950
And that's why many of you voted for
Mary over Charmila, because you believe,

119
00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:38.849
some of you, that Charmila, she had that
0 at the end there, she's probably gone.

120
00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:42.409
And that means that we need a second coin.

121
00:06:42.409 --> 00:06:46.110
And this bad boy over here,
this is the death coin.

122
00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:49.410
Okay, this coin we flip every period,
big heavy coin.

123
00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:51.170
When this coin comes up heads,

124
00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:55.260
all that means is you'll live
to have another opportunity.

125
00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.800
And then you can pull out your purchase
coin and flip it, heads I buy,

126
00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.030
tails I don't.

127
00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:03.710
But when this one comes up tails,
I'm gone and I'm gone for good.

128
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:08.180
Now, I'm not literally saying death,
and I hope you understand that, but

129
00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:12.510
I'm saying that people just drop out of
purchasing certain kinds of products,

130
00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:14.410
services, product categories.

131
00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:15.930
Again, I don't know why.

132
00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:18.438
You no longer have needs for
it, and so on, so

133
00:07:18.438 --> 00:07:22.536
we have the quote unquote death coin,
I'm gonna flip this every period.

134
00:07:22.536 --> 00:07:24.477
And again, when it comes up heads,

135
00:07:24.477 --> 00:07:27.920
it doesn't tell me anything
about my actual behavior.

136
00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:31.100
It just gives me the opportunity
to flip the other coin to

137
00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:32.620
have some behavior happen.

138
00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:37.290
But when this coin comes up tails,
I'm gone and I'm gone for good.

139
00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:39.300
That's gonna be my whole story.

140
00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:43.940
And in the same way that we're gonna allow
for differences among people in their buy

141
00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:47.760
coin, the fancy word we
use is heterogeneity.

142
00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:51.950
Just as we allow for heterogeneity on the
purchase rates, we're also gonna allow for

143
00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:54.590
heterogeneity on the death rates.

144
00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:57.196
So if you recall this
picture that I showed you,

145
00:07:57.196 --> 00:08:00.847
that shows all the different kinds
of distributions about how many

146
00:08:00.847 --> 00:08:05.499
people might have very high versus low
death propensities, same kinda thing here.

147
00:08:05.499 --> 00:08:10.403
We're gonna pick statistical
distribution that's gonna capture just

148
00:08:10.403 --> 00:08:16.040
the differences across people and just how
a death prone or how life prone they are.

149
00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:19.260
And again I don't know,
even if you have a very death prone coin,

150
00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.559
I don't know exactly
when you're gonna die.

151
00:08:21.559 --> 00:08:23.965
You're flipping this
coin that's very tailsy,

152
00:08:23.965 --> 00:08:27.056
it's pretty likely to come up tails,
but, you can get lucky and

153
00:08:27.056 --> 00:08:30.440
go two or three, four, or
five periods without it happening.

154
00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:31.680
It's all random.

155
00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:33.530
It's all probabilistic.

156
00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:38.070
And so I'm gonna have these two coins,
each person carrying different ones

157
00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:41.320
that have different weight on
heads versus tails on buying and

158
00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.970
heads versus tails on dying.

159
00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:48.540
And that gives us what I like to
call a buy till you die model.

160
00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:52.500
These are models that have been around
in marketing for close to 30 years now.

161
00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:56.850
I didn't invent them myself, although I'm
happy to say I've helped popularize and

162
00:08:56.850 --> 00:09:01.870
extend them, and we found that in
many many different kinds of context.

163
00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:03.410
Whether it's purchasing,

164
00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:06.260
whether it's participating in
different kinds of events.

165
00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.230
A wide variety of
activities when people have

166
00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:12.910
a repeated opportunity to
make something happen.

167
00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:15.610
Whether it's transactions,
visits to websites,

168
00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:19.520
filing insurance claims, and so on.

169
00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:24.507
That these buy till you die models
are extremely powerful in their ability

170
00:09:24.507 --> 00:09:28.449
to make pretty long range
projections about the buying and

171
00:09:28.449 --> 00:09:31.274
the dying that we might see in the future.

172
00:09:31.274 --> 00:09:36.172
Their ability to make statements about
the next period is maybe as good

173
00:09:36.172 --> 00:09:37.840
as a regression model.

174
00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:41.196
And honestly if your objective
is just to make statements about

175
00:09:41.196 --> 00:09:44.920
the short term use regression models,
they’re the best.

176
00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:48.070
But if your desire is to make
statements about the longer run,

177
00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:51.030
then these kinds of models,
and other models like them.

178
00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:53.930
I'm not endorsing any
one model specifically.

179
00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:56.790
But I'm just talking about
the idea of looking at the data,

180
00:09:56.790 --> 00:10:00.850
telling a story about the random processes
that are happening underneath it.

181
00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:05.670
Tell that story, coin flips, spinning
wheels, whatever randomization you

182
00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:10.440
might wanna use, tell the story about how
those propensities vary across people.

183
00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:15.530
Tell a story about how those propensities
vary over time and then do the math.

184
00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:19.786
I'm gonna skip all the math for you right
now, although it's not that hard, and

185
00:10:19.786 --> 00:10:23.809
in a case like this implementing the model
isn't gonna be difficult at all.

186
00:10:23.809 --> 00:10:27.054
If you're interested,
we'll post some links to papers and

187
00:10:27.054 --> 00:10:31.660
technical notes that will let you learn
about the development of these models.

188
00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:36.200
But let's take a break and then let's talk
about actually bringing the model to life

189
00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:37.500
and what some of the results look like.
