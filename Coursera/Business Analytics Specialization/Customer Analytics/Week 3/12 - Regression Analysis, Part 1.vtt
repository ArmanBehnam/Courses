00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.715
Welcome to Customer Analytics.

2
00:00:05.715 --> 00:00:06.795
So, as Pete mentioned,

3
00:00:06.795 --> 00:00:10.105
there are broadly two ways in which we can think about quantifying data.

4
00:00:10.105 --> 00:00:12.730
One is making predictions one period ahead.

5
00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.485
The other is making predictions more than two periods ahead.

6
00:00:15.485 --> 00:00:17.805
So, in this module, we'll talk about the first one,

7
00:00:17.805 --> 00:00:20.905
making predictions one period ahead. How do we do that?

8
00:00:20.905 --> 00:00:23.100
It's done through regression analysis.

9
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.280
So, what we're going do in this module is to talk about a simple example,

10
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.990
show how regression can be done,

11
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.735
show what predictions that can make,

12
00:00:29.735 --> 00:00:34.120
and then we'll take it off with Pete who will talk more about two periods ahead.

13
00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.095
So, let's start with regression analysis.

14
00:00:36.095 --> 00:00:37.610
What is regression all about?

15
00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.390
It's about quantifying the relationship between two or more variables.

16
00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.025
Let's take a simple example.

17
00:00:43.025 --> 00:00:46.705
Suppose you're looking at demand or data of people purchasing,

18
00:00:46.705 --> 00:00:48.830
and you know how prices were changing.

19
00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.800
What you'd like to do is to think about how you can

20
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.655
start thinking about how price is changing demand.

21
00:00:54.655 --> 00:00:58.050
In other words, put some numbers behind it.

22
00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.040
Let's look at some jargon of regression.

23
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.940
What we are trying to do is to explain a dependent variable, in this case,

24
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.030
sales or demand, as a function of independent variables,

25
00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.670
in this case, price.

26
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:12.805
So, in other words,

27
00:01:12.805 --> 00:01:15.400
all we're trying to do in regression is try to make

28
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.670
predictions of what would be the demand at different prices.

29
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.090
Regression is a technique that uses

30
00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.455
simple linear additive model to make these kinds of predictions.

31
00:01:26.455 --> 00:01:29.795
It'll become clear by taking a simple example.

32
00:01:29.795 --> 00:01:34.970
Let's imagine this is the demand data for a particular firm at different prices.

33
00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.240
What this firm was trying to do is to try and

34
00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.060
understand how their prices might change demand.

35
00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.349
So, they ended up changing the prices,

36
00:01:42.349 --> 00:01:44.100
and they observed the demand.

37
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.390
The very first thing you should do when you start thinking about

38
00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.515
quantifying the relationship is just plot the data.

39
00:01:50.515 --> 00:01:54.405
So, let's plot it. Here's what the plot looks like.

40
00:01:54.405 --> 00:01:56.035
What do we see here?

41
00:01:56.035 --> 00:01:58.745
On the horizontal axis, we have price.

42
00:01:58.745 --> 00:02:01.325
On the vertical axis, we have sales.

43
00:02:01.325 --> 00:02:05.165
What we see here, which is what intuitively you would expect to see,

44
00:02:05.165 --> 00:02:08.405
is that as prices go up, sales come down.

45
00:02:08.405 --> 00:02:10.509
On the one hand, it's intuitive,

46
00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:11.695
it makes a lot of sense,

47
00:02:11.695 --> 00:02:13.920
and this is what you would call a demand curve.

48
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.520
Price is going up. Sale is coming down.

49
00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.380
Where does regression come in?

50
00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.165
Regression comes in to give some hard numbers.

51
00:02:21.165 --> 00:02:23.915
You can eyeball it and see that as you increase price,

52
00:02:23.915 --> 00:02:25.300
sales does come down.

53
00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.700
But we would like to say specifically by how much.

54
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.680
In other words, we'd like to answer the following question.

55
00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.070
If I increase price by one dollar,

56
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.105
how much does sales come down?

57
00:02:36.105 --> 00:02:38.000
That's where regression comes in.

58
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.730
What does regression do?

59
00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.800
It tries to fit a straight line to the data that we see

60
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.710
here and tries to put formal numbers behind this demand curve.

61
00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:52.185
Broadly, what we're going to talk about in a simple example is demand analysis.

62
00:02:52.185 --> 00:02:54.610
This is a specific example for regression.

63
00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.590
You can think about doing it for many other types of data.

64
00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.640
What we're doing here is sales as a function of price.

65
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.020
You can think about sales as a function of advertising.

66
00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.090
You can think about a variety of

67
00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.060
different variables that you'd like to see if they're connected together.

68
00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.400
So, the first thing to do before we start analyzing any data is to plot it.

69
00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.010
Look at it visually. This is what this plot is trying to do here.

70
00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.300
In the vertical axis,

71
00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.920
we have demand or quantity,

72
00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.530
and on the horizontal axis, we have price.

73
00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:28.245
As expected, what you see here is that as price goes up, demand comes down.

74
00:03:28.245 --> 00:03:30.320
This is the standard demand curve.

75
00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.485
In other words, at lower prices,

76
00:03:32.485 --> 00:03:33.770
there is higher demand;

77
00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:35.025
and at higher prices,

78
00:03:35.025 --> 00:03:36.575
there is low demand.

79
00:03:36.575 --> 00:03:39.635
So, this is visually looking at the data.

80
00:03:39.635 --> 00:03:42.380
But at some point, when managers have to start thinking

81
00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.700
about how price sensitive are their consumers,

82
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.265
what would be the change in demand if they change their prices?

83
00:03:49.265 --> 00:03:51.365
One can't just look at it visually.

84
00:03:51.365 --> 00:03:54.270
One has to put a more structured pattern on it.

85
00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.775
That's what we're going to do with regression.

86
00:03:56.775 --> 00:03:58.565
So, in the next two slides,

87
00:03:58.565 --> 00:04:03.260
what you will see is we're going to take this data and run a regression analysis on

88
00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.990
it to put a more quantitative approach

89
00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:09.625
on how price and demand are connected to each other.

90
00:04:09.625 --> 00:04:12.025
In the equation that you see above,

91
00:04:12.025 --> 00:04:14.285
sales is a function of price.

92
00:04:14.285 --> 00:04:16.955
So, the sales, which is on the left-hand side,

93
00:04:16.955 --> 00:04:18.310
is the dependent variable.

94
00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.795
This is what we're trying to explain.

95
00:04:20.795 --> 00:04:24.830
Things on the right-hand side of the equation form the independent variables.

96
00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.480
In this example, price is the only independent variable that we're using.

97
00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.705
Now, if you focused on the right-hand side,

98
00:04:31.705 --> 00:04:34.900
we see a few coefficients floating around. What are these?

99
00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.330
The coefficient in front of the price variable,

100
00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.145
b, is termed as price sensitivity.

101
00:04:40.145 --> 00:04:44.710
It basically captures how sensitive your demand is to price.

102
00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.920
So, for instance, as a manager,

103
00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.810
if you'd like to answer the following question: if I change my price by one dollar,

104
00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.335
how much would my demand change?

105
00:04:54.335 --> 00:04:58.535
The coefficient b would be very helpful in determining that.

106
00:04:58.535 --> 00:05:01.555
The next one is the coefficient, a.

107
00:05:01.555 --> 00:05:03.525
This is termed as the intercept.

108
00:05:03.525 --> 00:05:06.980
This basically captures the baseline level of demand.

109
00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.660
Finally, we have the error term, e,

110
00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.090
which is on the right-hand side. What does this capture?

111
00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:15.460
This basically captures the idea that,

112
00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.520
of course, demand might be varying,

113
00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:22.125
might be going up and down for many other reasons besides just price.

114
00:05:22.125 --> 00:05:24.035
For example, they could be promotions,

115
00:05:24.035 --> 00:05:27.060
advertising, competitive actions, and so on.

116
00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.130
If you notice, in this particular equation,

117
00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:32.250
we are only capturing price.

118
00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:35.080
So, the error term or e basically

119
00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:39.105
comprises of all the things that you've left out of the model.

120
00:05:39.105 --> 00:05:42.640
Now, of course, if the model is good,

121
00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:47.130
the error term or the things that you've not put into the model should be small.

122
00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.855
If unfortunately the model is not very good,

123
00:05:49.855 --> 00:05:51.955
the error term might be quite large.

124
00:05:51.955 --> 00:05:54.930
So, in the next slide, I'll talk about a metric called the R

125
00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:58.785
squared that captures this idea of how good the model is.

126
00:05:58.785 --> 00:06:02.120
Now, if you focus on the equation in the bottom of the slide,

127
00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.315
you will see the more general form of what we just discussed.

128
00:06:05.315 --> 00:06:07.720
This is termed as simple regression.

129
00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:11.345
The idea here is that the dependent variable, y,

130
00:06:11.345 --> 00:06:12.900
which is on the left-hand side,

131
00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:15.135
is related to the independent variable,

132
00:06:15.135 --> 00:06:17.185
x, which is on the right-hand side.

133
00:06:17.185 --> 00:06:19.290
So, the equation that we just discussed,

134
00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:21.375
which is sales as a function of price,

135
00:06:21.375 --> 00:06:27.370
is one instance of the simple regression where there is only one independent variable.

136
00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:29.590
So, how does regression work?

137
00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:31.440
Basically, the idea is,

138
00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.700
regression tries to fit a straight line, in this case,

139
00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:38.480
the demand equation, to the data that we just saw.

140
00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:44.585
Here's what it looks like. Once we do the statistical analysis behind the scenes,

141
00:06:44.585 --> 00:06:48.465
in terms of fitting the straight line to the plot that we just saw,

142
00:06:48.465 --> 00:06:51.395
what you will notice is the regression line,

143
00:06:51.395 --> 00:06:54.260
which is plotted on top of the data points.

144
00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.910
What do we immediately see here?

145
00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:59.310
The first thing is that there is some sanity check.

146
00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:01.255
In other word, face validity.

147
00:07:01.255 --> 00:07:04.130
The regression line is downward-sloping,

148
00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:07.505
which is very similar to what we had found earlier, which is,

149
00:07:07.505 --> 00:07:09.945
at higher prices, the demand should be low;

150
00:07:09.945 --> 00:07:12.330
and at lower prices, the demand should be high.

151
00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:14.000
The regression line capture

152
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.915
this general trend that there is a downward-sloping demand curve.

153
00:07:17.915 --> 00:07:22.455
Next, what we see are actually values of a and b.

154
00:07:22.455 --> 00:07:27.420
So, a is 10.13 and b is minus 0.9.

155
00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:30.630
Let me discuss first what is the price sensitivity.

156
00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:32.990
If prices are measured in dollars,

157
00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:34.480
which is the case here,

158
00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.910
and the demand is in units,

159
00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:39.255
what the coefficient b here says,

160
00:07:39.255 --> 00:07:42.210
if I increase my price by one dollar,

161
00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:45.735
my demand will come down by 0.9 units.

162
00:07:45.735 --> 00:07:49.980
So, that's the idea of price sensitivity, which is captured by b.

163
00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:56.235
Finally, you see that the R squared is 87 percent or 0.87. What does that mean?

164
00:07:56.235 --> 00:07:58.790
That basically means the following: R

165
00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:02.115
squared is a metric of how good your regression model is.

166
00:08:02.115 --> 00:08:04.585
It basically varies from 0-1,

167
00:08:04.585 --> 00:08:08.170
and higher numbers are better in the sense that the regression

168
00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:11.850
is able to capture a lot of the variation in sales.

169
00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:14.050
So, in this case, in words,

170
00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:22.225
what it says is 87 percent of the variation in sales or demand is captured by prices.

171
00:08:22.225 --> 00:08:24.400
What is the remaining 13 percent?

172
00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.260
That's where the error term comes in.

173
00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.690
So, in this case, 87 percent of

174
00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:32.125
the overall variation is captured by the model, which is pretty good,

175
00:08:32.125 --> 00:08:35.450
and 13 percent is unaccounted for maybe

176
00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:39.435
because of variety of reasons like promotions and other kinds of things going on.

177
00:08:39.435 --> 00:08:43.875
What is the typical threshold for R squared to determine whether it's a good model?

178
00:08:43.875 --> 00:08:46.975
Of course, it depends from one context to another.

179
00:08:46.975 --> 00:08:49.095
The typical threshold is about 70 percent,

180
00:08:49.095 --> 00:08:51.630
or R squared equal to 0.7.

181
00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:53.490
So, in this side, what do we see?

182
00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:56.110
We see what the regression equation is,

183
00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:58.295
we see what the R squared is,

184
00:08:58.295 --> 00:09:00.680
and it basically tells us how good is

185
00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:04.620
the regression line in terms of how well it fits the data.
