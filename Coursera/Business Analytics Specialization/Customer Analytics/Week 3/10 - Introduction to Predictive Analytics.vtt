00:00:04.807 --> 00:00:08.290
Welcome to week two of our
course on customer analytics.

2
00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.880
I hope from week one all those
discussions that you heard talking about,

3
00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.480
get a good sense of the kinds of data and
data structures that companies will often

4
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.390
have the kinds of information that
customers leave about themselves,

5
00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.520
their interactions with each other,
their interactions with the firm.

6
00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.510
We're gonna start talking about
what you do with all of that data.

7
00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:31.550
So it's one thing to
have all that rich data,

8
00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.780
it's a nice thing to be able
to just to summarize it,

9
00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.830
to take some snapshots of it, to
calculate some simple summary statistics.

10
00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.220
Well, we want to talk about
going to that next step.

11
00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.390
We want to talk about
predictive analytics.

12
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.190
So, how do you take that data and

13
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.700
make statements about activities
that haven't happened yet?

14
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.380
And there's all kinds of predictions
that we might want to make.

15
00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.060
So, we might want to predict which of
these customers is gonna buy next.

16
00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.210
We might want to predict how many
purchases are they gonna make?

17
00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.970
We might want to predict things
about customer churn, so

18
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.280
how many of our customers
will stay with us.

19
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.120
So there's lots and lots of different
kinds of things that we can predict,

20
00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:15.300
and there's lots and lots of tools that
we can use to make those predictions.

21
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:20.450
First thing that I want to do is to
try to give you a broad framework for

22
00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.150
some of those kinds of tools.

23
00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.040
I basically want to break them up into
two different kinds of buckets so

24
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.550
you have a better appreciation,
because sometimes it gets really confusing

25
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.720
when people start throwing a lot
of these technical names at you,

26
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.260
it's not clear exactly which tool you're
using for which decision purpose.

27
00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.370
So, I wanted to try to lay that out.

28
00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.340
And then we're gonna bring Weingard
back in to talk about one of those

29
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.510
sets of tools in some detail, then I'll
pick up to talk about the other set.

30
00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.930
And really it's not to talk
about the tools, per se,

31
00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.970
this is to kind of give you the language,
the framework,

32
00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.850
the understanding of which kinds of tools,
which techniques you're gonna use when.

33
00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.170
So if you're looking for all the technical
stuff, you're in the wrong place.

34
00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.862
But if you want to have an understanding
of just which tools you're gonna pull out

35
00:02:07.862 --> 00:02:10.143
of that kit and use for
which kinds of decisions and

36
00:02:10.143 --> 00:02:13.202
which kinds of contexts,
you're absolutely in the right place.
