1
00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.960
Okay, so you've had some time
to think about Mary vs Sharmila.

2
00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:10.470
So which one of them would be the more
valuable customer, where value

3
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:15.810
is defined as likely to make more
donations in the next five opportunities?

4
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:18.740
In fact, I'd like a show of
hands from you over here.

5
00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.780
So, if you think that Mary is the one
who will be more valuable in the future,

6
00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:23.740
raise your hand.

7
00:00:27.746 --> 00:00:28.400
Great.

8
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.020
And for those of you that think
Sharmila will be the more valuable one.

9
00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.310
Let's see 'em.

10
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.820
Okay.

11
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.510
And any of you think it'll be a tie?

12
00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:38.455
Any of you think that Mary and

13
00:00:38.455 --> 00:00:41.330
Sharmila will be worth pretty
much the same as each other?

14
00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:42.658
Anyone go for a tie?

15
00:00:42.658 --> 00:00:44.100
No one likes a tie.

16
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.790
No one ever goes for a tie.

17
00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.410
And I mean this seriously,
that if we're in this analytic space and

18
00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.380
it's our job as a consultant or

19
00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:58.400
a vendor firm to score the customer
database to say who's the most valuable.

20
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.110
Who's the least valuable and
how everyone ranks in between.

21
00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.070
If we said these two are a tie, it would
make it sound like we don't know what

22
00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.940
we're doing here, so
it's interesting that we don't like ties.

23
00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.990
All right, so
let's talk about Mary versus Sharmila.

24
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.310
And it's interesting to see that I saw
not all, but most of the hands go up for

25
00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:24.810
Mary, although for those of you who did
vote for Sharmila, I can understand why.

26
00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.380
Cuz if we look back at Mary
versus Sharmila, it seems pretty

27
00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.170
obvious why Sharmila would be the better
customer, because if you count up

28
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.340
the number of donations that they made,
Mary made four, Sharmila made five.

29
00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.020
If you went to this nonprofit, or
any company, and say hey look.

30
00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.970
Here's a customer who made four purchases,
here's a customer who made five purchases.

31
00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.180
Which one do you think
is more valuable to you?

32
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.500
People are gonna give you a funny look.

33
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.360
Well, it's kinda obvious isn't it,
I'm gonna take five over the four, right?

34
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.690
Yet, most of you didn't vote for
Sharmila, most of you voted for Mary.

35
00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:05.870
And why is that?

36
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.530
How can it be the case that
someone who actually missed

37
00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.550
two donation opportunities might be more
valuable than someone who missed only one?

38
00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:23.300
And of course the answer to that question,
if you can say it to the camera right now.

39
00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.330
Cuz it's not only a function of how
many donations did they make, or

40
00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.560
how many opportunities did they miss,
but it's also very important

41
00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.920
to take into account when they made or
missed those opportunities.

42
00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.200
You see with Mary, yes it's true
that she missed two times, but

43
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.678
in both cases she came back afterwards.

44
00:02:43.678 --> 00:02:45.110
But for Sharmila,

45
00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.880
that zero at the end there, that might
mean more than just oops I forgot.

46
00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.360
It might mean that she no longer
likes our organization and

47
00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.910
she doesn't want to deal with us.

48
00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.760
It might mean that she no
longer has any needs at all for

49
00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.590
this particular service that we provide.

50
00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.160
It might be that she moved
to some other geography.

51
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.410
It might be that she died.

52
00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.790
I mean, I don't know, but
there can be all kinds of reasons

53
00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.550
why this zero that we see for
Sharmila might not just be an oops.

54
00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:16.690
It might be a she's gone and
she's not coming back.

55
00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.610
So for those of you voted for

56
00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.580
Mary over Sharmila, you're looking
at that zero at the end there and

57
00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:27.590
saying that zero, that single zero for
Sharmila carries a lot of weight.

58
00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.970
In fact it carries more weight then
the two zeros that we saw for Mary.

59
00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.290
And if you think through that logic,
if you voted for Mary over Sharmila.

60
00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.240
What did you just invent in the process?

61
00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.970
Well, if you think about what we spoke
about a short time ago, remember RFM?

62
00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.385
Let's put the M part aside, since we
don't know how much they're spending.

63
00:03:47.385 --> 00:03:51.250
But what you were doing is you were
making a trade-off between R and F.

64
00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.490
And you would basically say, if you voted
for Mary, that recency trumps frequency.

65
00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:01.400
I would rather see someone who I know was
with me more recently, because there's

66
00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.770
a better chance that they're still alive
than someone who did more with me but

67
00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.330
there's some reasonable
chance that they're gone.

68
00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.990
And that's why our forefathers in
direct marketing called it RFM.

69
00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:17.110
Because they noticed time and time again
that recency was more important than

70
00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:20.260
frequency, which was more
important than monetary value.

71
00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.330
And basically all you
folks who just voted for

72
00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.100
Mary, you just basically
reinvented that wheel.

73
00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.400
And that's a great thing.

74
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.810
It's a recognition that recency and

75
00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.160
frequency are these two
key summary statistics.

76
00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.670
In some sense, I don't even care about
the particular combination of the,

77
00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:38.940
of the zeros and the ones.

78
00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.720
If you could just tell me when
the last one occurred, and

79
00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.060
how many ones there were,
that's all I need to know.

80
00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.132
That's gonna be enough for me to make
some trade-offs between the Marys and

81
00:04:50.132 --> 00:04:51.580
the Sharmilas.

82
00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.330
And if we go a step further with that,

83
00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:58.360
this is a great example of where we're
not necessarily trusting the data.

84
00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.340
We're looking at the data as an indication

85
00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.790
of something that's going on
below the surface of the data.

86
00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.277
In other words recency and
frequency are nice to know, but

87
00:05:07.277 --> 00:05:12.263
more importantly they're indicators of
the true, underlying, unobservable,

88
00:05:12.263 --> 00:05:15.980
propensities of people to make purchases,
to drop out.

89
00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:17.380
To do other kinds of things.

90
00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:21.490
And it's those underlying unobservables
that are gonna help us make

91
00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:22.560
better predictions.

92
00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.560
Especially over the long run.

93
00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.790
And that's exactly what
I'm talking about here.

94
00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:30.690
Look, we look at someone like Mary and
say, she just made a donation.

95
00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:32.510
Of course she's alive.

96
00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:35.380
We expect there's a pretty
good chance that she might

97
00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:38.710
make a donation in the next period,
because she was around last time.

98
00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:43.484
But with Sharmila,
we see that zero and we ask ourself,

99
00:05:43.484 --> 00:05:47.659
"did she just miss one,
or is she gone for good?

100
00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:50.427
Is she a dormant customer
who might come back, or

101
00:05:50.427 --> 00:05:53.680
is she a lapsed customer who
really is gone for good?".

102
00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:58.510
And this is where we can't necessarily
trust the data to answer that question

103
00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:59.300
for us.

104
00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:03.882
Again it can get us some indications but
we need to tell a story about the stuff

105
00:06:03.882 --> 00:06:08.179
that's going on below the surface of
the data, in order for us to really

106
00:06:08.179 --> 00:06:12.713
understand and make the kinds of long
run projections that we want to make.

107
00:06:12.713 --> 00:06:14.700
Let me give you one other example.

108
00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.730
So and I promise this is the last one.

109
00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:20.550
Let's compare Mary to Chris over here.

110
00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:23.510
And I want you to do the same kind of
thing that you did with Mary and Sharmila.

111
00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:25.473
I want you to look at their histories.

112
00:06:25.473 --> 00:06:28.160
I don't want you to get
caught up on any one of them.

113
00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:33.800
I want you to think about that
general type of pattern overall and

114
00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.310
who would be more valuable.

115
00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:37.320
The Marys or the Chris's.

116
00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.090
So take a moment and think about that.

117
00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:43.530
Look over the pattern, think about
what's relevant there, and tell me.

118
00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:44.150
Would you go for

119
00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:47.800
Mary, in terms of which one's likely
to make more purchases in the future?

120
00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.350
Would you go for Chris?

121
00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:52.010
Or would you just say,
eh, they're the same?

122
00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:56.050
So think about that for a second and
I'll jump right in and answer it.

123
00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:59.160
So what do you extract from each of
these patterns to determine how they

124
00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.570
compare with each other?

125
00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:03.280
And I'm going to read the minds
of somebody right now.

126
00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:06.690
I bet that some of you looked at
the Chris pattern over here and said,

127
00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:12.700
well since Chris was acquired,
he's gone zero one one zero one one.

128
00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:14.340
So as I look into the future,

129
00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:18.660
I think Chris is gonna go
zero one one zero one one.

130
00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:19.460
And you know what?

131
00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:21.250
You fell into my trap.

132
00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:23.560
So again,
I don't necessarily trust the data.

133
00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:27.790
Do you really believe that Chris is,
every three years is thinking.

134
00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:32.770
Hmm, is this the year that I skip and
then I'm on for two more years?

135
00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:36.780
Probably not, I think that
there's just much more chaos and

136
00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:40.880
noise when people are actually
making these kinds of decisions.

137
00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:45.000
So I don't really wanna look at
the very specific pattern, I wanna draw

138
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.580
the appropriate summary statistics,
that it's gonna tell me something,

139
00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:53.590
not everything, but something about
what's going on below the surface.

140
00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:55.330
Of course the other thing
that many of you did,

141
00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:58.530
I hope that all of you did it,
is you looked at Mary and Chris, and

142
00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:01.480
the first thing you looked at
would be recency and frequency.

143
00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:05.120
And you looked at Mary and
Chris and said, they are the same.

144
00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:10.690
Now some of you might have stopped right
there and said, look, Pete told me

145
00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:14.190
recency and frequency is all that matters
and even though Mary and Chris have

146
00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:18.780
different patterns, their R and F is the
same, so I'm gonna treat them as the same.

147
00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:22.960
And even though they don't like ties,
in some cases if I don't have any

148
00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:27.630
really good information to the contrary,
I'm going to go with that tie.

149
00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:30.450
But I bet that some of you
weren't willing to stop there.

150
00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:35.010
And some of you said, well okay,
the recency and frequency is the same so

151
00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:36.990
let's find a tie breaker.

152
00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:42.050
let's look one period back from the most
recent period and what do we see?

153
00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:44.280
Huh, they both made a donation.

154
00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:47.930
We need to go into double overtime now,
and what do we see?

155
00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:50.930
Oh, Mary made a donation, Chris didn't.

156
00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:52.530
I'll go with Mary.

157
00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:54.100
And to you I say, "shame,

158
00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:58.890
shame shame." Because when our forefathers
in direct marketing invented RFM,

159
00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:05.130
it was all about recency and frequency,
it wasn't about third order recency.

160
00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:10.010
Look, the fact is, that Mary and
Chris both gave most recently.

161
00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:12.300
We know that they were alive last period,

162
00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:14.910
we know that they were alive
at the period before that.

163
00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:20.210
So in some sense I don't really care where
their third to last purchase took place.

164
00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:25.410
All I care about is, say it with me,
recency and frequency.

165
00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:28.470
That's why I was joking
around earlier about ties.

166
00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:32.785
Again, we tend not to like them, we
tend to view that as a sign of weakness.

167
00:09:32.785 --> 00:09:35.800
That we can't do the analysis and
sort these customers out.

168
00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:41.070
But in some cases, if we don't have really
good information to do that sorting out,

169
00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:42.530
we might as well go with a tie, and

170
00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:46.130
I think that would be appropriate
in the case of Mary and Chris.

171
00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:47.990
Okay, that's enough examples for now.

172
00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:52.020
I think by now we've done enough
both to motivate this data set and

173
00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:56.230
the kinds of things we wanna do with it,
as well as some of the early insights.

174
00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:59.570
What I wanna do next though is to
talk about a very specific model.

175
00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:03.550
A story about what's going on
below the surface of the data

176
00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:07.400
that's gonna let us make accurate
projections about Bob and

177
00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:11.970
Sarah, Mary, Sharmila,
Chris, and everybody else.

178
00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:12.730
That's coming next.
