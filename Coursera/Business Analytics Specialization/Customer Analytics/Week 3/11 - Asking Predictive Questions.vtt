00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.080
So let's dive right in and
start talking about data.

2
00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.660
The kinds of data that
Rigou was talking about.

3
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.710
The kinds of data that you as
a consumer might be creating.

4
00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.720
The kinds of data that you as a manager
might be using in order to make

5
00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.570
statements about how well
your business is doing.

6
00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.510
So just imagine,
let's just take one consumer.

7
00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:24.630
Imagine that the consumer is seeing
some ads over here, here, and here,

8
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.390
maybe she's getting some direct
mail,or maybe email from the company.

9
00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.690
She's getting messages and
offers here, here, and here.

10
00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:35.120
And maybe she's making purchases.

11
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.480
So she buys something over here,
here, and here.

12
00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.080
And maybe she returns one
of these products as well.

13
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.720
Or maybe she has contacts
with customer service.

14
00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.710
Or maybe she's engaged in social media and
she's posting ratings and reviews, or

15
00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.200
interacting with other friends
about this product or service.

16
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.120
So you start to a sense of the wealth
of data that becomes available.

17
00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.000
And again Rigou did a nice job of talking
of both some of these individual metrics.

18
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.420
As well as the different kind
of marketing activities,

19
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.220
competitive information, you might want to
put on top of that macro economic data,

20
00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.470
there's all kinds of factors out
there that we might be tracking.

21
00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.360
And that might have some influence on the
kinds of behavior that people are doing.

22
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.510
Well, what are you gonna
wanna do with that data?

23
00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.860
Well, besides trying to just
draw inferences from it.

24
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.280
So just tell me how much stuff I sold.

25
00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.480
Tell me what my market share is.

26
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.330
Tell me how many promotions I ran,

27
00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.160
and how many things I sold
during those promotions.

28
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.770
All of that stuff is great.

29
00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.000
But if you notice as I'm talking
about it I'm gesturing over here.

30
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.540
Cuz what's over here?

31
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.350
That's the past, right?

32
00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.840
And it's great to be able to summarize
data, and it's great to be able

33
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.490
to draw insights from the data that
you have, but that's not enough.

34
00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.500
If you wanna run your
business most effectively,

35
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.130
if you really wanna take full advantage
of the kinds of analytics that, well,

36
00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.380
that's why you're taking this course.

37
00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.740
We want to be over here.

38
00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:00.980
Right?
We want to be making some

39
00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.268
predictions about the future,
and that's the hard part.

40
00:02:04.268 --> 00:02:07.190
So that's where I want to talk about
different kinds of predictions that we

41
00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:08.970
might want to make.

42
00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:09.530
So again,

43
00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.700
it might be how many purchases this
person is going to make in the future.

44
00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.720
It might be is this person going to churn?

45
00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.370
Are they going to drop their
subscription with us or not?

46
00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.120
And while a lit of these things might
sound just wildly different from each

47
00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:29.080
other, as I said before, we can break them
down into basically two kinds of buckets.

48
00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.620
And so for so
many times when we're making predictions,

49
00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.540
we wanna make predictions about
a fixed period in the future.

50
00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.810
So we might wanna know,
in the next month or

51
00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.890
in the next year,
how many purchases will this person make?

52
00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.600
Or how many products will they evaluate,
or how many products will they return?

53
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.990
So we're gonna take a fixed period of time
and we wanna make statements about it.

54
00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:57.310
And likewise it might not only be
questions about how many purchases or

55
00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.480
returns or whatever people are doing.

56
00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.780
We might want to make
statements about whether or

57
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.230
not someone's going to do
something of interest.

58
00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.100
Will they make a purchase?

59
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.800
Will they drop their contract?

60
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.000
Okay so,
there's different kinds of decisions, but

61
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.840
it's all taking place
within that fixed period.

62
00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.160
Now, I'm going hand things back to.

63
00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.680
So, he's going talk about some simple,
popular, but very powerful techniques.

64
00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.255
So he's gonna let us answer some of
those questions about how many things

65
00:03:26.255 --> 00:03:30.540
might take place, or whether or
not certain activies might take place.

66
00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.410
So we're gonna cut to Rigou, we're gonna
hear him talk about some of those models,

67
00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.060
then we're gonna come back and I'm gonna
talk about an entirely different framework

68
00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.840
based on the very same kind of data.

69
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.410
But to be able to ask and

70
00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:47.260
answer questions about when,
how long, beyond one single period.
