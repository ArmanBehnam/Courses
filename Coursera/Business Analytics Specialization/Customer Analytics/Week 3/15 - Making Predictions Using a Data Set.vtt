00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:04.910
All right, enough of this abstract
talk about period one, period two,

2
00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:06.690
period three.

3
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:07.790
I wanna get real.

4
00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.860
I wanna talk about a real data set, with
real customers, real behavior, and real

5
00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:18.160
decisions on the part of the organization
that actually provided the data to us.

6
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.080
I'm gonna actually start
with a non-profit context.

7
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.270
And you might find that appealing,
you might not.

8
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.050
In some sense it really doesn't matter.

9
00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.780
Let me just give you a few details about
it, and then when we look at the data set

10
00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:34.970
as whole you'll see that it's applicable
to a broad variety of different settings.

11
00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.330
Profit, non profit, domestic,
international, B to B, B to C.

12
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.320
I think everyone will find something
appealing about this basic kind of data.

13
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.400
I want to talk about a specific
non profit organization

14
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.130
that's looking at its donors over time.

15
00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.640
So with so many companies, they're gonna
take their customers, their donors and

16
00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.990
we're gonna find a whole bunch of them
who were acquired at the same time.

17
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.840
I think this is actually a very
important lesson beyond the analytics,

18
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.300
beyond the predictive models.

19
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.720
Very important for companies to be able to
look at their customers on a cohort basis.

20
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.230
Let's identify all customers who we
either acquired at the same time,

21
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.750
we acquired them through the same campaign
or maybe through the same channel or

22
00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.470
maybe they all made the same
first purchase with us.

23
00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.792
Well, in this case it's gonna
be a time-based cohort.

24
00:01:22.792 --> 00:01:26.180
We're gonna look at a bunch of
donors who made their first

25
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.550
donation to this non profit
organization in 1995.

26
00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.490
So, in other words,
with knew nothing about these people.

27
00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.760
They didn't exist to us at all until 1995,
they made a donation.

28
00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.290
Like, hey, we have a new donor here.

29
00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.500
And so we're gonna follow these folks for
the six years after 1995 and

30
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.580
then we're gonna wanna make predictions
about them for the five years after that.

31
00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.730
So we're talking about
a very long data set.

32
00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.900
Again, the kind of data that companies
might not have had available to them at

33
00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.580
all in the old days.

34
00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.390
But today, because of digital everything,
it's becoming increasingly easy to create

35
00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.900
these long histories for customers,
and more important than ever,

36
00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.980
to be able to make statements about
who's gonna do what, when in the future.

37
00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.950
So you can picture the data
structure right over here.

38
00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:22.370
We can see we have 11,104 customers,
11,104 rows in a spreadsheet and

39
00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.880
then we have these bunch of columns
where each columns represents a year and

40
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.740
we're simply asking, did they or
didn't they make a donation?

41
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:32.740
For right now.

42
00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.600
We don't care how many
donations they might have made,

43
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.500
although rarely do people make
more than one a year, and

44
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.670
we don't even care about the M part of RFM
or what the size of those donations were.

45
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.990
All we care about is did they donate or
not.

46
00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.670
I'm gonna give a 1 if they did make
a donation and a 0 if they didn't.

47
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.550
So if you look at the data structure here,
first you see this whole column of ones.

48
00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:59.350
Because that's telling us that all of
these customers were acquired in 1995.

49
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.300
And now you see a bunch of zeroes and
ones to the right of that,

50
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.050
basically saying did they or
didn't they make a donation.

51
00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.850
Over each of the next six
years after being acquired.

52
00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.840
So, let's first stare at that data and
really get to know it better,

53
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.480
and then we're gonna wanna make some
statements about who's likely to do what

54
00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.570
in the future.

55
00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.980
Before we even do that, though,
just look at this data set.

56
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.770
There's a bunch of customers doing
things or not doing things over time.

57
00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.110
So in this particular case,
it's donations.

58
00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.520
But you can imagine this very same
data structure for, oh I don't know,

59
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.950
a hotel chain.

60
00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.640
So we have a bunch of people
in our loyalty program,

61
00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.060
did they stay in one of our properties or
not in a given month?

62
00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.460
It might be for a credit card firm.

63
00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:50.330
Did these people have revolving interest
charges or not on a month-to-month basis?

64
00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.600
It could be for
a mobile gaming application.

65
00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.070
Did people play the game or
not on a day-to-day basis?

66
00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:01.970
So I hope you can see that this
data structure is very general.

67
00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:03.520
It's very practical.

68
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.380
I don't really care what the ones and
zeros represent.

69
00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:13.240
Whether they're purchases, whether they're
posting social media, staying in hotels,

70
00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.370
interest charges, whatever it might be and
I don't even care what the time period is.

71
00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:22.750
So here we're focusing on a year as the
period, but it absolutely can be a month,

72
00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:28.590
a week, a day, even a second
depending on what the situation is.

73
00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.340
So before I go on I just want
you to appreciate just the,

74
00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.820
the generality of this
kind of data structure.

75
00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.950
It's data that many of you have
contributed to as consumers,

76
00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.180
as companies try to track and
anticipate what you might be doing.

77
00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.540
And also on the business side, you might
be working with data structures like this.

78
00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.010
To help you become just a little
bit more comfortable with it,

79
00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.360
let me just pick out a few examples here.

80
00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.240
And I'd like you to actually make
a prediction for me based on

81
00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.535
what limited information you have, what
you see in front of you on this slide.

82
00:04:58.535 --> 00:05:01.840
I'd like you make some predictions for
certain kinds of customers.

83
00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.240
So for instance,
let's start with Bob over here.

84
00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.790
So look at Bob, you can see that
after Bob was acquired in 1995, and

85
00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:13.750
again, we're not gonna predict the 1995
purchase cuz we know nothing about Bob or

86
00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:17.040
anyone else in this data set until
after that purchase occurred.

87
00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:21.490
Look at Bob, out of six opportunities,
he donated all six times.

88
00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.300
He went six out of six.

89
00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.480
So let's make statements about Bob for
the next five years.

90
00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.650
So in fact I'd like you to
really write that down.

91
00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:35.000
What's your best guess about how
many donations Bob will make

92
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.800
out of the next five opportunities.

93
00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:41.000
And if your answer is I don't know,

94
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.320
I don't have any idea,
then you're absolutely right.

95
00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.860
Because, to be honest with you,
I don't necessarily care about Bob.

96
00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.680
I don't necessarily care
about this one customer.

97
00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.700
What I really care about in my ability
to make good predictions about,

98
00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:59.390
wouldn't be Bob per se,
it would be the Bobs.

99
00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:03.550
Tell me about all the customers who
share these same characteristics.

100
00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:06.910
And so while it might be hard for me to
make statements about any one of them,

101
00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:11.470
once I start grouping them together, and
in this data set, as you'll see, there

102
00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:16.700
are about 1,200 Bobs, I wanna be able to
make statements about the Bobs on average.

103
00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:22.050
So if we think about the Bobs, who have
gone six out of six since being acquired,

104
00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:27.110
how many donations on average will they
make out of the next five opportunities.

105
00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:31.500
So any one of them will make zero, one,
two, three, four, or five donations.

106
00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:35.090
When we look across all of them,
some will make zero, some will make five,

107
00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:38.000
some will make two or three,
what's the average across all of them?

108
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.430
I want you to write that number down.

109
00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:44.360
So that's Bob, and
now let's look at Sarah over here.

110
00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.550
Since being acquired in 1995,
what has Sarah done?

111
00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:48.170
Nothing!

112
00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:49.540
She's the opposite of Bob.

113
00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:52.660
She's gone O for six,
she's done absolutely nothing.

114
00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:57.650
So I want you to make a prediction
about Sarah, or again, the Sarahs,

115
00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:01.600
all of these customers who have
done nothing since being acquired.

116
00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.550
Now, you might be wondering.

117
00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:05.630
Why should we make statements about Sarah?

118
00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:07.460
She's done nothing for six years.

119
00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:09.030
Let's just get rid of those customers.

120
00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:10.940
They can't be worth much to us.

121
00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:15.760
And the fact of the matter is, any one
of the Sarahs probably isn't worth much.

122
00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:19.180
But why is it that we're so
interested in tracking Sarah?

123
00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:21.050
Because there's so many of them.

124
00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:23.030
Even if you look at this
slide right over here,

125
00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:27.020
look at how many Sarahs you see
with the zero since being acquired.

126
00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:31.610
Turns out that the Sarah, that is to say
customers who do nothing after being

127
00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:37.030
acquired over some observable period
of time, are very, very common.

128
00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:41.210
In this data set,
they represent about 33% of the customers.

129
00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:44.490
I see in many data sets
they are often over 50%.

130
00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:49.110
So while any one of those Sarahs might not
be worth much, collectively to the extent

131
00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:52.890
that there's any value in them at all,
when we add all that up, the Sarahs can

132
00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:58.040
actually still be a fairly large chunk
of value for the company in the future.

133
00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:00.550
Especially when we look over the long run.

134
00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:04.700
So I want you to write down your
prediction for Sarah, or for the Sarahs.

135
00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:09.350
How many donations on average will they
make over the next five opportunities?

136
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:11.700
And I have one more quiz question for
you right now.

137
00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:15.200
I want you to compare Mary and Sharmila.

138
00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.000
Okay, I'm not even going
to say anything about them.

139
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.430
You can see the numbers for
yourself right over here.

140
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:20.820
So I want you look at Mary and

141
00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:24.240
Sharmila and in fact I want
you to answer two questions.

142
00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.770
Question one.

143
00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:30.090
Which of them will be worth more,
on average, over the next five years?

144
00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:31.550
And question two.

145
00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:33.120
By how much?

146
00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:36.690
So take a minute, look at the Marys,
look at the Sharmilas,

147
00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:40.290
and think what it is that makes one
of them more valuable than the other.

148
00:08:40.290 --> 00:08:42.270
And I want you to write that down, and

149
00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:46.890
make that prediction about which one's
gonna be more valuable, and by how much.

150
00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:50.720
We'll take a break and we'll come on back
and talk about some of the logic that you

151
00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:54.559
might have been using to make that
decision between Mary and Sharmila.
