00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:06.230
Hello I'm professor Brian Bushee,
welcome back.

2
00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.850
In this video we're gonna take
a look at revenue manipulations.

3
00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.390
A revenue manipulation is where a manager
takes advantage of the discretion

4
00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:18.960
in the revenue recognition criteria
to find a way to recognize more

5
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.920
revenue during the period which in turn
should increase the company’s earnings.

6
00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.690
We’ll look at a number of tools and

7
00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:31.050
ratios that you could use to try to detect
these kinds of revenue manipulations.

8
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:31.840
Let’s get started.

9
00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:39.110
Let’s start with a brief overview of the
issues involved in revenue recognition.

10
00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:44.320
So if you remember, revenue is
recognized when it's both earned,

11
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.680
which means the company provides goods or
services, and realizable,

12
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.650
which means the price is fixed and
collection of cash is probable.

13
00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.560
But note that this does not
require that the company has

14
00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.390
actually collected the cash.

15
00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.614
And that means that revenue can be
recognized before cash is collected and

16
00:01:01.614 --> 00:01:03.440
we're gonna call this noncash revenue.

17
00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:06.990
So at the delivery of goods or services,

18
00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.720
what the company would do is increase
revenue and increase accounts receivable

19
00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.190
which is the money owed to
the company by the customers.

20
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.800
Then eventually when
the cash is collected,

21
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.810
the company would increase cash and
then reduce these accounts receivable.

22
00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.090
What we're gonna look out for

23
00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.700
is acceleration of revenue
into the current period.

24
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.528
Maybe what happens is the company
recognizes the revenue before it's fully

25
00:01:29.528 --> 00:01:31.337
delivered the goods and services.

26
00:01:31.337 --> 00:01:33.328
Or maybe what the company does,

27
00:01:33.328 --> 00:01:38.690
it provides the customer right of return
if it's not resold by the customer.

28
00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.210
Which would mean that it's
not technically realizable,

29
00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.430
because collection of
cash is not probable.

30
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.671
Anyway, 50% of SEC enforcement actions
are related to revenue recognition.

31
00:01:48.671 --> 00:01:51.949
So half the companies that get
busted by the SEC do so for

32
00:01:51.949 --> 00:01:57.840
these revenue recognition criteria, and
that's because it's not quite this simple.

33
00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.020
Here's what the true standard looks like,
this is SAB 101.

34
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.910
And this is a simplified flow chart

35
00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:07.870
explaining how companies should decide
whether they can recognize revenue or not.

36
00:02:10.182 --> 00:02:11.490
>> Ay caramba!

37
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.410
I need my other pair of
glasses to read this.

38
00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.211
This is going to take me
a long time to memorize.

39
00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.940
>> Don't worry,
you don't have to memorize this.

40
00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.440
Again I just put this up there to
highlight the amount of discretion and

41
00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.830
judgement there is in
the revenue recognition process.

42
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.400
Besides, you're never gonna see this
flowchart anyway outside the company, so

43
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.920
you wouldn't be able to evaluate it.

44
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.820
Instead we have to work backwards,

45
00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.280
we have to start with
the financial statement results.

46
00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.540
Then look at some red flags
to try to figure if we're

47
00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.290
suspicious in how the company
implemented all of these decisions,

48
00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.470
in this complicated revenue
recognition flow chart.

49
00:02:52.078 --> 00:02:56.620
So, we're gonna use some red flags to
try to identify potential changes in

50
00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.402
revenue recognition policies for
companies.

51
00:02:59.402 --> 00:03:03.860
We're gonna look for unusual,
seasonally adjusted quarterly trends in

52
00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.562
revenue growth,
accounts receivable growth.

53
00:03:06.562 --> 00:03:10.480
We're gonna look for unusual trends
in ratios, such as days receivable,

54
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.940
accounts receivable to revenue,
and revenue per capacity unit.

55
00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.440
And then we'll try to figure out what
happened if we find unusual trends.

56
00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.660
So do earnings management incentives
exist for a company in this quarter?

57
00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.900
And is there anything unusual in their
revenue recognition policy that we

58
00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:28.450
can find?

59
00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.660
So the first thing we're gonna
look at are revenue growth trends.

60
00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.630
So growing firms tend to have
revenue growth in all four quarters.

61
00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.500
Whereas earnings management
is much more likely to happen

62
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.130
in a specific quarter when you're
trying to meet a specific target.

63
00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.670
One thing we have to be aware of is
that firms have some seasonality in

64
00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:48.320
their revenue.

65
00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.000
So, what seasonality means is maybe you
have a higher percentage of your sales

66
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.080
during a holiday season
than a non-holiday season.

67
00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.830
So to get a good comparison we need to
look at the holiday season this year

68
00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.230
to the same holiday season last year.

69
00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.280
So we are going to compute something
call year over year revenue growth or

70
00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.260
YoY revenue growth.

71
00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.250
That’s revenue this
quarter minus revenue for

72
00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.220
the same quarter last year divided by
revenue for the same quarter last year.

73
00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.520
And we’ll compare this
to a couple benchmarks.

74
00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:22.580
Time series, we’re going to look at
whether the growth is unusual for

75
00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.608
one specific quarter for the firm.

76
00:04:24.608 --> 00:04:29.114
And then cross-sectionally we'll
see if the growth is unusual for

77
00:04:29.114 --> 00:04:31.337
the industry in a given quarter.

78
00:04:31.337 --> 00:04:32.795
>> Time-Series?

79
00:04:32.795 --> 00:04:34.254
Cross-sectional?

80
00:04:34.254 --> 00:04:39.530
Y'all are speakin' like
a pointy-head professor again!

81
00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.420
>> Sorry,
I do talk like an academic sometimes and

82
00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.780
I probably will use these terms a lot.

83
00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.740
Times series just means you're
looking at the same firm across time.

84
00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:54.840
Whereas cross-sectional means you're
comparing the firm to other companies or

85
00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:55.615
to the industry.

86
00:04:55.615 --> 00:05:00.730
We're also going to look at
growth in accounts receivable.

87
00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:04.609
If you remember noncash revenue would
be captured in changes in accounts

88
00:05:04.609 --> 00:05:05.378
receivable.

89
00:05:05.378 --> 00:05:08.547
So by looking at changes in accounts
receivable we get a sense for

90
00:05:08.547 --> 00:05:11.190
how much of this revenue is not cash.

91
00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:13.365
So we're gonna look at YoY
growth in accounts receivable,

92
00:05:13.365 --> 00:05:15.540
again YoY is year over year.

93
00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.410
As the accounts receivable at the end
of this quarter minus the the accounts

94
00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:21.190
receivable by the end of
the same quarter last year

95
00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:24.430
divided by that accounts receivable,
so it's seasonally adjusted.

96
00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:26.930
We're gonna compare it to benchmarks.

97
00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.400
We're gonna look at time trends for
the company.

98
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.940
We're gonna compare the company's
trends to the industry trends.

99
00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:37.380
We're also gonna compare the growth in
accounts receivable to revenue growth

100
00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.360
to see how much of the revenue
growth is noncash.

101
00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.200
Not only will we compare it to growth and
revenue but

102
00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.620
we're gonna compare it to the growth
in the amount of cash that's collected.

103
00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:50.260
And cash collected can be
calculated by taking revenue

104
00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.690
plus accounts receivable at
the beginning of the period.

105
00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:56.540
So that's the total amount of cash
that could have been collected.

106
00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:00.010
Minus ending accounts receivable,
which is cash that wasn't collected.

107
00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:02.650
What's left over is the amount of
cash collected during the period.

108
00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:06.700
We're gonna take a look at some ratios.

109
00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:10.070
So we're gonna go back to our old friend,
days receivable.

110
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.645
Because a large increase in days
receivable could indicate a spike in

111
00:06:13.645 --> 00:06:16.590
noncash revenue at the end of the quarter.

112
00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:20.300
We've seen this before using annual data,
the average of accounts receivable over

113
00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.740
the year, divided by annual revenue,
times 365.

114
00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:26.390
We're gonna look at a quarterly version

115
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:30.570
where we take the average accounts
receivable over the past five quarters.

116
00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:35.260
And divided by it TT revenue,
then times 365.

117
00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.930
TT stands for trailing 12 months.

118
00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:43.000
So we're gonna add up the four quarters
that end at the quarter we're looking

119
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.720
to approximate a year's worth of revenue

120
00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:50.290
that ends at the point of
the quarter that we're looking at.

121
00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:54.450
>> Although I am a genius at math,

122
00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:58.950
I would rather not do more math
than absolutely necessary.

123
00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:03.510
So why not just use this quarter instead
of adding up all of the prior quarters?

124
00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:09.220
>> Great question, the reason that we
don't just use one quarter is seasonality.

125
00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:13.280
Because of seasonality,
these quarterly ratios could jump up and

126
00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:17.690
down quite a bit from quarter to quarter
just due to the seasonality in sales.

127
00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:22.100
By using the year ended with that quarter,
we smooth out

128
00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:26.870
the seasonality which makes it easier
to spot abnormal trends in the ratios.

129
00:07:28.368 --> 00:07:31.930
We're also gonna look at the ratio of
accounts receivable to revenue, which

130
00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:37.810
again could indicate a spike in noncash
revenue if we see a large increase.

131
00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:40.920
This is gonna be defined as accounts
receivable divided by our trailing 12

132
00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:41.700
month revenue.

133
00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:46.100
And finally we're gonna look
at revenue per capacity unit.

134
00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:50.870
The idea here is a large increase in
revenue per capacity unit could indicate

135
00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:55.100
fraudulent revenue that's beyond the
normal capacity of the company to produce.

136
00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:56.630
So we'll look at revenue per employee,

137
00:07:56.630 --> 00:08:00.430
which is our trailing 12 month revenue
divided by number of employees.

138
00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:02.946
Revenue per property, plant and equipment,

139
00:08:02.946 --> 00:08:05.559
which is our TT Revenue
divided by gross PP&E.

140
00:08:05.559 --> 00:08:10.890
Again, if these go up, it could indicate
we're producing more revenue per employee,

141
00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:13.760
more revenue per piece of
equipment than we have before.

142
00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:16.820
Which may be beyond our
capacity to produce and

143
00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:18.670
could indicate fraudulent revenue.

144
00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:23.270
>> Yada, yada, yada.

145
00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:26.120
Please give us some numbers already.

146
00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:28.660
>> Sure no problem,
why don't we go ahead and do a case?

147
00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:33.540
Case we're gonna look at
is Pawsome Electronics.

148
00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:37.760
They make consumer products for dogs,
things like microchip enabled food bowls,

149
00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:42.060
electric toothbrushes, soothing sound
machines to help the dog sleep.

150
00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:47.770
Electric blankets, and of course their
popular aromatherapy vaporizers.

151
00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:51.970
They sell products to retail stores and
to online retailers.

152
00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:55.400
They don't make any direct
sales to customers.

153
00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:57.350
Pawsome was struggling during 2012-2013,
so

154
00:08:57.350 --> 00:09:01.360
they hired a new CEO who
was a turnaround expert.

155
00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:08.072
The new CEO made a lot of changes during
2013-2014, increased their marketing

156
00:09:08.072 --> 00:09:12.760
budget, implemented a new, just in time,
automatic, retail delivery arrangement.

157
00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:16.350
So when a customer was
running low on vaporizers,

158
00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:19.440
Pawsome would automatically
send them more product.

159
00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:22.090
They reduced their product line
to focus just on the winners, so

160
00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:24.670
they got rid of a lot of
their loser products.

161
00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:27.999
Which allowed them to close
18 of their 26 factories and

162
00:09:27.999 --> 00:09:31.739
cut their work force from
12,000 to 7,500 employees.

163
00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:37.470
Pawsome now has had an awesome
turnaround in performance in 2014.

164
00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:41.190
Revenues are up 19%,
net income is $123 million,

165
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:44.770
versus a loss of $196
million in the prior year.

166
00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:48.290
Stock price has risen
59% over the year and

167
00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:52.139
eight security analysts now have buy or
strong buy recommendations on the stock.

168
00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:56.760
There's a lot of rumors about
the company that you can find on TV,

169
00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:59.810
that the company's looking to
acquire other companies and

170
00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:02.800
that the CEO actually got a job
offer to come to another company.

171
00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:07.920
So before we look at the numbers,
let's take a second to think are there any

172
00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:12.996
earnings management incentives that
Pawsome's management might have.

173
00:10:12.996 --> 00:10:19.290
Without a turnaround the CEO would lose
his reputation as a turnaround expert.

174
00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:23.460
>> And it sounds like the CEO is looking
to jump ship to another company.

175
00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:26.350
>> With a high stock price
it will be easier for

176
00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:28.670
Pawsome to acquire another company.

177
00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:33.020
>> And I bet those security analysts
would be madder than a wet armadillo

178
00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:35.030
If Pawsome did not have
such high earnings.

179
00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:39.570
>> Excellent job identifying
earnings management incentives.

180
00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:42.820
Seems like the CEO has some
pretty strong incentives this

181
00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:45.270
period to manipulate earnings.

182
00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:49.120
That's the process that I want you to go
through before you look at the numbers

183
00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.870
in the rest of these cases.

184
00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:52.350
Now in the interest of time,

185
00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:55.130
I'm not gonna have the virtual
students do it in the future.

186
00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:59.090
Instead, I want you to try this on your
own, so before you look at the numbers,

187
00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:02.610
pause the video and think about
the earnings management incentives.

188
00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:05.960
So now let's go to the Pawsome spreadsheet
and take a look at some numbers.

189
00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:10.402
So let's look at the data for Pawsome,

190
00:11:10.402 --> 00:11:13.462
I pulled in three years
of quarterly results.

191
00:11:13.462 --> 00:11:16.560
I got the revenue, net income,
accounts receivable.

192
00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:19.168
Cash collected is computed from
revenue and accounts receivable,

193
00:11:19.168 --> 00:11:21.280
you can see the formula there if you want.

194
00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:24.190
Gross property, plant,
equipment, number of employees.

195
00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:27.490
So first let's look at the year
on year change in revenue.

196
00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:31.380
So 2013, it was negative,
as they were still struggling.

197
00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:36.960
2014, the first two quarters of the year,
we see 10%, 13% growth.

198
00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:42.490
And then we see 25 and 26% growth
in the last two quarters of 2014.

199
00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:45.410
So it looks like the turnaround strategy
is really kicking in those last two

200
00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:46.880
quarters.

201
00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:48.580
If we look at change in receivables,

202
00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:51.780
it's negative when the change
in revenue's negative.

203
00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:56.320
It's roughly comparable to the change in
revenue in the first two quarters, but

204
00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:00.140
in the last two quarters it gets to
be a much bigger change in accounts

205
00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:02.620
receivable than in revenue, hm.

206
00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:08.921
If we look at change in cash collected,
negative when revenue growth was negative.

207
00:12:08.921 --> 00:12:12.843
Then it's sort of up and
down a lot during 2014, but

208
00:12:12.843 --> 00:12:16.690
it's certainly much less
than the growth in revenue.

209
00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:20.980
If we look at the ratio of
accounts receivable to revenue,

210
00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:22.580
it was in the low 20s.

211
00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:24.550
It went up a lot in
the quarter one of 2014,

212
00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:28.565
back down, and then back up
again in the last two quarters.

213
00:12:28.565 --> 00:12:34.243
Same pattern for days receivable,
around 81 to 82 days in 2013,

214
00:12:34.243 --> 00:12:41.587
jumps up to 88, down to 84, 85, jumps back
up to 87 in the fourth quarter of 2014.

215
00:12:41.587 --> 00:12:44.670
Now let's look at revenue per
property plant and equipment.

216
00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:46.750
It was in the low twos, and

217
00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:51.470
then it jumped up dramatically in
the last two quarters of 2014.

218
00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:56.589
Same thing with revenue per employee,
a big jump in these last two quarters.

219
00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:02.050
Now, it's never gonna be the case
that all of these ratios jump out and

220
00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:05.230
scream, earnings management,
earnings management, earnings management.

221
00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:08.490
This is fairly typical where some
of the ratios are suspicious,

222
00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:11.000
other ratios are not that suspicious.

223
00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.010
And so, I think there's a little
reason to be suspicious based

224
00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:18.610
on the change in receivables
versus the change in revenue.

225
00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:23.210
And the revenue capacity per capacity
unit, but not every ratio is

226
00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:26.350
screaming earnings management,
which is fairly typical unfortunately.

227
00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:30.860
>> Is it not within
the realm of possibility

228
00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:34.950
that the growth in sales was due to
a splendiferous holiday sales season?

229
00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:38.820
>> Yes it is within
the realm of possibility and

230
00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:43.250
that's why we need to benchmark
these trends with some competitors.

231
00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:47.270
So if we see the same trends in
the competitors then it's probably not

232
00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:50.260
earnings management but
just something going on in the industry.

233
00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:53.350
So I'll bring up a couple competitors and
we'll do this analysis now.

234
00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:55.930
But just as a heads up I'm not
gonna do this every video.

235
00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:58.790
In the interest of time you
can assume in the future,

236
00:13:58.790 --> 00:14:02.090
that the things that we're looking at for
the firm are abnormal.

237
00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:06.651
But I figure we may as well take the time
to go through a competitor analysis at

238
00:14:06.651 --> 00:14:07.451
least once.

239
00:14:07.451 --> 00:14:12.940
So I brought in data for two of Possum's
competitors, Fidotronics and Chienco.

240
00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:16.530
Instead of fighting through all
the numbers, I've put them into graphs so

241
00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:18.440
that we can easily compare.

242
00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:21.462
So Pawsome is in orange, this is
the year on year change in revenue.

243
00:14:21.462 --> 00:14:27.710
You see the big increase in 2014 that
was not shared by their competitors.

244
00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:30.350
If we look at the year on year
change in accounts receivable we see

245
00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:32.270
the big spike for Pawsome.

246
00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:34.770
Again, not reflected in their competitors,
so

247
00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:38.980
we know that the accounts receivable
increase was not due to industry or

248
00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:41.199
economy effects, but
it was unique to Pawsome.

249
00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:45.000
Change in cash collected,
not much of a trend.

250
00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.679
Accounts receivable to revenue,
days receivable,

251
00:14:48.679 --> 00:14:52.048
yeah, it's hard to see
much of a trend going on.

252
00:14:52.048 --> 00:14:56.970
Sales to PP&E we can see for Pawsome,
it's hard to see with the scale,

253
00:14:56.970 --> 00:15:02.530
but Pawsome, we see it going up whereas
the two competitors it's flat or down.

254
00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:06.730
And sales to employees, it's going up for
all of these companies, but

255
00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:10.400
there's a continued big increase for
Pawsome at the point where their

256
00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:13.920
competitors seem to
level out a little bit.

257
00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:16.140
So again, not conclusive, but

258
00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:21.330
it does suggest that Pawsome was
unique in terms of its growth in

259
00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:26.080
revenue versus its growth in AR and in
these revenue per capacity unit measures.

260
00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:30.190
>> You have piqued my curiosity.

261
00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:32.820
Please tells us what happened.

262
00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:34.130
>> Okay here's what happened.

263
00:15:35.818 --> 00:15:40.350
So it turned out Pawsome CEO engaged
in a channel stuffing scheme

264
00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:43.290
in the last two quarters of 2014.

265
00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:47.620
Remember that change in policy
to going to the just in time

266
00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:48.770
inventory delivery system?

267
00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:53.850
Well, the CEO manipulated that system to
deliver extra goods to retailers just

268
00:15:53.850 --> 00:15:59.000
before the quarter end, increase revenue,
but of course it's all noncash.

269
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.010
The retailers then returned all
the excess inventory to Pawsome, but

270
00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:04.780
the returns happened in the next quarter.

271
00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:08.840
So that allowed Pawsome to get
the benefit of the sales and

272
00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:12.370
make their earnings target this quarter
and then they took the hit next quarter.

273
00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:15.530
But what it did was it kept their stock
price high because they were meeting their

274
00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:18.910
earnings target which allowed them
to acquire two other companies

275
00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:20.370
which doubled the size of the company.

276
00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:24.830
However, some analysts started to raise
some concerns about the high growth in

277
00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:26.330
accounts receivable.

278
00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:30.490
The auditor saw that and the auditor saw
all the returns that were coming back and

279
00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:33.790
started to question the revenue
recognition practices.

280
00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:37.890
And eventually Pawsome, because of these
criticisms, had to restate their prior

281
00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:42.600
results to remove all their questionable
revenue and all this stuff became public.

282
00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:46.230
Pawsome's reputation took a big
hit with customers and investors,

283
00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:49.760
they ended up filing for bankruptcy
within three years of this scheme and

284
00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:52.900
eventually were acquired
by DogWorld Industries.

285
00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:57.430
So this was a situation where Pawsome had
clear earnings management incentives,

286
00:16:57.430 --> 00:16:59.070
they were trying to do acquisitions,

287
00:16:59.070 --> 00:17:03.700
the CEO was looking to get out of
the company before things went bad.

288
00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:07.040
We saw the change in the revenue
recognition policy, and

289
00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:11.500
then a lot of these ratios indicated that
there was a lot of noncash revenue, and

290
00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:14.390
maybe the revenue was too big for
their capacity, and so

291
00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:16.320
there were a lot of suspicions here.

292
00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:19.580
Again, putting those together
doesn't conclusively mean that it's

293
00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:23.000
always gonna be a fraud, but
when you see those things line up,

294
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.100
the incentives,
the change in policy, the ratios.

295
00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:30.418
Then it becomes much more likely that
you're looking at something where there's

296
00:17:30.418 --> 00:17:31.410
been earnings management.

297
00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:36.580
That was an awesome example
of this kind of analysis.

298
00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:40.250
So the tools that we looked at are gonna
be really good at trying to spot

299
00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:45.340
aggressive revenue recognition that
happens before cash is received.

300
00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:48.550
But sometimes the aggressive
revenue recognition happens

301
00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:50.480
after the cash is received.

302
00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:52.990
And that's what we're gonna take
a look at in the next video.

303
00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:54.180
I'll see you then.

304
00:17:55.610 --> 00:17:57.087
>> See you next video.
