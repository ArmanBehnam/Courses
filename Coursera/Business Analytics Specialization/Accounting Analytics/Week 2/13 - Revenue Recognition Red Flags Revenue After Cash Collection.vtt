00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.060
Hello, I'm Professor Brian Bushee,
welcome back.

2
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.090
In this video, we're gonna continue
our look at revenue manipulations.

3
00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:12.870
This time, we are gonna look
at manipulations involving

4
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.660
revenue recognition that comes
after the cash has been received.

5
00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.920
And in addition to looking at
manipulations that increase revenue,

6
00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.548
we'll also look at manipulations
that decrease revenue.

7
00:00:25.548 --> 00:00:28.660
Which is what the manager might
wanna do if they're trying to smooth

8
00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.640
out the revenue from a new product launch.

9
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:32.410
Let's get started.

10
00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.930
So let's start talking about
the problems with revenue recognition

11
00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:39.510
after a sale is made.

12
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.260
Here's a quick reminder of
the revenue recognition criteria.

13
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.090
Revenue's recognized when it's earned,
which means you've provided goods and

14
00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:47.080
services.

15
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.670
And realizable,
which means the price is fixed, and

16
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.530
it's probably you can
collect from customers.

17
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.150
So primarily we're gonna look at,

18
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.030
is revenue is sometimes
recognized after cash collection.

19
00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.470
And we're gonna focus again
on this non-cash revenue,

20
00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.199
which can be potentially manipulated.

21
00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.710
This arises when a company
has multiple deliverables.

22
00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.740
That means that they deliver some goods or

23
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.670
services now with the remainder
being delivered in the future.

24
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.410
So it's a problem with the earned criteria
that the revenue is not fully earned until

25
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.500
all the goods and
services have been provided.

26
00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.210
So in this case a company
will have an unearned or

27
00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.900
deferred revenue liability
account when it receives cash but

28
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.620
does not recognize all
the revenue at the time of sale.

29
00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.730
It's a liability because it's
an obligation for the company to deliver

30
00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.709
the future goods and services that
are part of the multiple deliverables.

31
00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.330
>> Your uncompromising vagueness in
discussing multiple deliverables

32
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.610
is bound to give me multiple headaches.

33
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.960
>> Okay, so let me give you an example
that should resonate with everyone

34
00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.390
watching this video.

35
00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.110
What if you decide to buy a Coursera
specialization and you pay for

36
00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.530
it up front?

37
00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.030
In that case, Coursera receives all
the cash, but they can't recognize all

38
00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.710
the revenue immediately because they
have to deliver the five courses.

39
00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.390
Instead, they would recognize
the revenue for one course, and

40
00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.640
the rest of the cash would
be unearned revenue.

41
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.830
Then as you took each additional
course in the specialization,

42
00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.290
Coursera would recognize revenue for
that course and reduce unearned revenue

43
00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.640
until the point when you were completely
finished with the specialization.

44
00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.420
At that point,
all the revenue would be recognized and

45
00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.290
there'd be no more unearned revenue.

46
00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.080
The two things that we're gonna look
out for, is first we're gonna watch for

47
00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.980
aggressive deferral of
revenues to future periods.

48
00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.590
Companies could smooth
a spike in current sales

49
00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.658
across future periods by
creating more unearned revenue.

50
00:02:46.658 --> 00:02:47.560
We're also gonna watch for

51
00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.880
aggressive recognition of unearned
revenue in the current period.

52
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.680
A company could smooth
a drop in current sales

53
00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.200
by recognizing more unearned revenue
as earned revenue in the period.

54
00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.730
And I need to show you an example
to try to get you to, I think,

55
00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.600
have some idea of what I'm
talking about with these.

56
00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.176
Okay, so in our example, let's say that
at the time of sale, a company receives

57
00:03:10.176 --> 00:03:14.530
$100 cash from customers and
delivers to them some software product.

58
00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.931
But the current software product
only represents 70% of the goods and

59
00:03:20.931 --> 00:03:23.590
services that the customer is paying for.

60
00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.056
The other 30% is for
customer service and for

61
00:03:27.056 --> 00:03:31.484
software updates that will be
delivered over the next year.

62
00:03:31.484 --> 00:03:35.222
The company anticipates that they'll be
things they'll have to patch or fix or

63
00:03:35.222 --> 00:03:38.419
update in the software, so
they're gonna deliver those updates.

64
00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:40.950
And plus they make customer
service available for that year.

65
00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.980
So in 2015,
let's say we start up with just new sales.

66
00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:51.489
And for each software we sell, we'll
get $100, so we increase cash by 100.

67
00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:57.453
We'll recognize 70 revenue,
that's the 70% for the current software.

68
00:03:57.453 --> 00:04:02.686
The other 30% or $30 will go into
an unearned revenue liability account,

69
00:04:02.686 --> 00:04:06.514
because we have an obligation
to deliver those updates and

70
00:04:06.514 --> 00:04:08.715
customer service in the future.

71
00:04:08.715 --> 00:04:12.242
For those of you who know debits and
credits, you should recognize that this is

72
00:04:12.242 --> 00:04:15.939
in debit and credit format, but if you
don't know debits and credits it's okay.

73
00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:17.770
You can just go with increase or decrease.

74
00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.032
So then in 2016,
we make more new sales software, and

75
00:04:23.032 --> 00:04:26.460
let's say we've increased
the price to 110.

76
00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:32.269
So for every piece of software we sell,
we would increase cash by 110.

77
00:04:32.269 --> 00:04:34.688
We would increase revenue by 77.

78
00:04:34.688 --> 00:04:36.440
That's the 70% of the cash.

79
00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.700
And we would increase unearned
revenue liability by 33 which is

80
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.990
the 30% that's gotta be
deferred to the following year.

81
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:53.475
Also in 2016, we're gonna recognize the
rest of the revenue being earned in 2015.

82
00:04:53.475 --> 00:04:56.670
So in 2015 we deliver
the customer service.

83
00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:58.372
We deliver the software updates,

84
00:04:58.372 --> 00:05:01.496
which means we reduce the unearned
revenue liability of 30.

85
00:05:01.496 --> 00:05:05.291
So that's getting rid of
the one we created in 2015.

86
00:05:05.291 --> 00:05:09.789
And we get to increase revenue by
30 to recognize the additional

87
00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:14.711
revenue from the 2015 sales that
we can recognize now in 2016.

88
00:05:14.711 --> 00:05:17.431
So adding it up, the totally revenue for

89
00:05:17.431 --> 00:05:20.955
2016 will be 77 from
current software sales.

90
00:05:20.955 --> 00:05:22.993
30 of unearned revenue,

91
00:05:22.993 --> 00:05:28.676
that we recognize this year from last
year's sales, for a total of 107.

92
00:05:28.676 --> 00:05:33.316
In 2016 cash collections, which are also
known as bookings, are gonna be

93
00:05:33.316 --> 00:05:38.220
equal to revenue plus the change in
unearned revenue during the year.

94
00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.400
So revenue is 107.

95
00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.590
Unearned revenue went up by 3,
33 minus 30.

96
00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:50.548
So if we add 107 plus 3,
we get 110 of cash collections in 2016.

97
00:05:52.487 --> 00:05:53.683
>> Seriously?

98
00:05:53.683 --> 00:05:56.250
This seems excessively complicated.

99
00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.350
The cash number is right there.

100
00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:59.580
Why do we have to compute it?

101
00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:04.070
>> The cash number is right there
in this simple example, but

102
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:08.330
in actual financial statements,
the cash number's almost never disclosed.

103
00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:11.430
So you almost always have to
do this kind of calculation

104
00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:13.940
to figure out the amount of
cash collections or booking.

105
00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:18.390
Let's start talking about some of
the ratios we're gonna look at

106
00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:22.700
to try to detect aggressive
behavior with unearned revenues.

107
00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:27.350
So the problem is that these noncash
revenues could reflect revenue and

108
00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:29.190
earnings smoothing activities.

109
00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:32.350
So we're gonna look at
the changes in unearned revenue

110
00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:36.790
because that's gonna pick up the amount
of noncash revenues during the period.

111
00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:39.770
We'll look at year over year
growth in unearned revenue,

112
00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:42.970
which is unearned revenue at the end of
this quarter minus the unearned revenue at

113
00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:44.730
the end of the same quarter last year,

114
00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:48.790
divided by that unearned revenue at
the end of the same quarter last year.

115
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:51.560
We'll look at year over
year growth in bookings.

116
00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.820
Bookings, which are also cash collections,

117
00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:57.840
as we saw earlier is revenue plus
the change in unearned revenue.

118
00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:59.640
And for the growth we'll look at bookings.

119
00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:00.870
This quarter minus bookings.

120
00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:04.320
The same quarter the last year
divided by bookings last year.

121
00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:08.665
And we'll benchmark this time-series,
we'll look at the firm over time.

122
00:07:08.665 --> 00:07:11.355
Cross-sectional, we'll
look at competitors and

123
00:07:11.355 --> 00:07:13.619
we'll compare this to year
over year revenue growth.

124
00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:16.110
In terms of ratios,

125
00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:21.550
were gonna look at days unearned revenue,
which is analogous to days receivable.

126
00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:22.200
In this case,

127
00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:27.510
days unearned revenue, and increase would
mean slower future recognition of revenue.

128
00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:31.762
A decrease would mean faster future
recognition of unearned revenue.

129
00:07:31.762 --> 00:07:36.510
It's gonna be calculated as the average
unearned revenue over the past 5 quarters

130
00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:41.440
divided by TT revenue times 365,
where TT is the trailing twelve months.

131
00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:45.590
We're gonna look at unearned
revenue divided by revenue.

132
00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:50.840
This represents the "cookie jar" of future
noncash revenue available to the company.

133
00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:54.545
And it's just unearned revenue divided
by the trailing 12 month revenue.

134
00:07:56.982 --> 00:07:59.555
>> What is this "cookie jar" you speak of?

135
00:07:59.555 --> 00:08:04.300
>> Y'know, if accountant gave out free
cookies, people might actually like you!

136
00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:09.780
>> Wait, people like accountants
don't they, don't they, don't they?

137
00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:14.580
Well anyway, getting back to the term,
cookie jar, this was first made famous by

138
00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:18.670
a former head of the FCC who gave
a speech on earnings management.

139
00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:21.240
And he used the analogy of cookie jars,

140
00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:26.140
where we used to have these jars around
the house that were full of cookies, and

141
00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:30.120
any time you were hungry, you could
open a jar, reach in, and eat a cookie.

142
00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:35.000
By analogy, any time a company is hungry
for extra revenue, they can reach

143
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.590
into their cookie jar of unearned revenue,
pull out some of that unearned revenue,

144
00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:43.490
and make it earned revenue and
help their bottom line earnings.

145
00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:48.316
So cookie jar refers to any account
that a manager could tap into to

146
00:08:48.316 --> 00:08:53.858
recognize extra revenue anytime they
want to manipulate their earnings.

147
00:08:55.368 --> 00:08:59.140
And then finally,
we have the bookings to revenue ratio.

148
00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:03.580
This relates the cash collections or
bookings to revenue recognition.

149
00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:05.920
We divide bookings by revenue.

150
00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:09.139
A ratio of greater than 1
means the business is growing.

151
00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:16.380
So the case we're gonna look at to try out
these red flags is the DoggieSoft Case.

152
00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:20.370
DoggieSoft manufactures
biometric tracking software for

153
00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:23.310
dogs along with wearable tracking devices.

154
00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:27.829
So, the dog puts on the tracking device
and the software keeps track of heart

155
00:09:27.829 --> 00:09:32.577
rate, breathing rate, pulse, calories
burned all this kind of statistics.

156
00:09:32.577 --> 00:09:37.420
And then automatically uploads it to
a computer when it has WiFi access.

157
00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:41.308
The company's policy is generally
been it recognize 70% of revenue

158
00:09:41.308 --> 00:09:45.207
upon sale to reflect the delivery of
the wearable device and software.

159
00:09:45.207 --> 00:09:50.268
The other 30% of revenue is unearned,
and deferred to future years, and

160
00:09:50.268 --> 00:09:55.172
then finally recognized based on
providing access to customer service,

161
00:09:55.172 --> 00:09:58.270
and providing software patches and
updates.

162
00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:03.885
So looking at DoggieSoft's recent
performance they had steady 10 % growth

163
00:10:03.885 --> 00:10:05.987
in their revenue through 2013.

164
00:10:05.987 --> 00:10:11.072
They introduced the new DS 4 tracking
device in the first quarter of 2014 and

165
00:10:11.072 --> 00:10:12.430
it was a big success.

166
00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:17.495
Their sales growth jumped up to 14% for
the year 2014.

167
00:10:17.495 --> 00:10:22.139
So let's go to the DoggieSoft spreadsheet
to take a look at how this affected their

168
00:10:22.139 --> 00:10:22.960
financials.

169
00:10:25.966 --> 00:10:30.732
So in the spreadsheet I brought in
quarterly results for DoggieSoft for 2012,

170
00:10:30.732 --> 00:10:32.101
2013, 2014.

171
00:10:32.101 --> 00:10:35.438
So we have revenue, unearned revenue
at the end of the period, and

172
00:10:35.438 --> 00:10:39.133
the cash collected are bookings,
which is, if you look at the formulas,

173
00:10:39.133 --> 00:10:42.430
calculated from the revenue and
the change in unearned revenue.

174
00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:45.560
So we look at the year over
year change in revenue.

175
00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:48.877
Here we see the steady 10% growth in 2013.

176
00:10:48.877 --> 00:10:52.345
Similar growth in deferred or
unearned revenue.

177
00:10:52.345 --> 00:10:54.458
Similar growth in cash collected.

178
00:10:54.458 --> 00:10:58.680
Unearned revenue is about 20% or
so of revenue.

179
00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:03.500
Days unearned revenue is around 80
with a little bit of variation due to

180
00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:04.840
seasonality.

181
00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:09.554
And the bookings to revenue ratio, again,
there's some variation due to seasonality,

182
00:11:09.554 --> 00:11:12.542
clearly the big quarter is
the third quarter of the year.

183
00:11:12.542 --> 00:11:16.493
2014, they come out in the first
quarter with the new DS4.

184
00:11:16.493 --> 00:11:20.780
We see now 14% sales growth
the rest of the year.

185
00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:22.740
But if we look at cash collected,

186
00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:26.265
we see that the bulk of this
spike was in quarter one.

187
00:11:26.265 --> 00:11:32.207
Then it was higher than 15% in quarter
two, but then it quickly dropped below.

188
00:11:32.207 --> 00:11:36.720
So how do they have this declining
pattern of cash collected, but

189
00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:39.360
smooth change in revenue?

190
00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:40.960
They upped their unearned revenue.

191
00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:45.680
So they're stashing away some of
this initial unearned revenue, and

192
00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:49.230
then slowly bringing it out
to manage their sales growth.

193
00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:53.260
You can see that because their
unearned revenue to revenue goes up.

194
00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:58.590
Their days unearned revenue goes up,
and their bookings though,

195
00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:01.880
go down in conjunction
with the cash collected.

196
00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:04.850
And I have a chart which shows you this.

197
00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:08.156
So the blue line is
their growth in revenue.

198
00:12:08.156 --> 00:12:13.340
Smooth 10%, jumps up to 14% and
then stays around that level.

199
00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:15.520
The gray is their cash collected.

200
00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:20.010
So you can see there's this big spike when
they made most of the sales of their new

201
00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:23.070
product but of course they don't
recognize all the revenue right away

202
00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:25.810
because some of it's unearned.

203
00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:29.320
Then you can see that their
sales plummet pretty quickly.

204
00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:32.900
And basically the orange line,
which is the unearned revenue,

205
00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:36.690
is what's used to get the grey
line as smooth as the blue line.

206
00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:41.917
So the company must have decided to
take more of these cash collections and

207
00:12:41.917 --> 00:12:45.205
hold them in the unearned
revenue cookie jar so

208
00:12:45.205 --> 00:12:49.864
that they could smooth out the growth
in revenue over the period.

209
00:12:52.766 --> 00:12:58.050
>> Honey, a company can't just decide
to defer more revenue on a whim.

210
00:12:58.050 --> 00:13:01.160
How could they possibly justify
this to their auditors?

211
00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:05.420
>> You're right, companies can
not do this solely on a whim.

212
00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:08.220
They have to have some
kind of controls in place

213
00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:11.120
to make sure that this is
not totally opportunistic.

214
00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:14.270
So what they have to do
is document in advance

215
00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:18.200
all the milestones that they have to
met in terms of delivering goods and

216
00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:22.210
services that would allow
them to recognize revenue.

217
00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:24.970
But they can come out with a new
document for each product.

218
00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:28.574
So if you launch a new product, you could
come out with a new document saying,

219
00:13:28.574 --> 00:13:31.753
what's the milestones that would
allow you to recognize revenue?

220
00:13:31.753 --> 00:13:37.014
Which does give you a little bit
of opportunistic behavior that

221
00:13:37.014 --> 00:13:41.887
you could engage in when you're
launching a new product.

222
00:13:41.887 --> 00:13:49.561
In 2015, the company introduced a new DS
4R tracking device in the first quarter.

223
00:13:49.561 --> 00:13:52.980
Not a completely different product, but

224
00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:57.678
marketed as a must-have
product upgrade over the DS 4.

225
00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:03.654
The rumors on the street were that
the sales of the DS 4R were disappointing,

226
00:14:03.654 --> 00:14:05.728
below what the company expected.

227
00:14:05.728 --> 00:14:10.100
It turns out the company also decided
to release a new software update for

228
00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:12.690
the DS 4 in the first quarter of 2015.

229
00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:17.215
And by the end of the year sales
growth had remained steady at 14%

230
00:14:17.215 --> 00:14:18.970
throughout the year.

231
00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:22.736
Which sort of contradicts some of those
rumors out there that the sales of

232
00:14:22.736 --> 00:14:24.896
the DS 4R were actually disappointing,

233
00:14:24.896 --> 00:14:27.873
it looks like the company
maintained its 14% growth.

234
00:14:27.873 --> 00:14:33.155
Well, let's take a look at its
financial results for 2015.

235
00:14:33.155 --> 00:14:34.911
So now let's bring back our spreadsheet.

236
00:14:34.911 --> 00:14:37.967
I've added the results for 2015.

237
00:14:37.967 --> 00:14:40.880
We can see the nice 14 %
sales growth continues,

238
00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:44.627
all though it starts to abate a little
bit near the end of the year.

239
00:14:44.627 --> 00:14:46.630
But look at this.

240
00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:49.090
Unearned revenue is decreasing and

241
00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:52.250
decreasing dramatically
as the quarters go on.

242
00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:56.850
Cash collected was way down
in the first quarter of 2015.

243
00:14:56.850 --> 00:15:01.910
That's when the rumor disappointing
sales of the DS 4R occured.

244
00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:07.710
And cash collected was far below the 14%
sales growth the rest of the year.

245
00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:10.700
We see the unearned revenue
to revenue is way down

246
00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:12.870
compared to where it was historically.

247
00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:15.749
The days unearned revenue starts to drop.

248
00:15:15.749 --> 00:15:20.838
And then we see some really low
booking to revenue ratios during 2015.

249
00:15:20.838 --> 00:15:22.940
So lets bring up a graph.

250
00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:27.180
The blue line is the revenue growth,
nice and smooth.

251
00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:30.071
The gray line is the change
in cash collected.

252
00:15:30.071 --> 00:15:32.069
And we can see the plummeting and

253
00:15:32.069 --> 00:15:37.555
that amount in the first quarter of 2015
with the disappointing sales of the DS 4R.

254
00:15:37.555 --> 00:15:40.007
It comes back a little bit.

255
00:15:40.007 --> 00:15:44.321
So the question is, how do you get from
this gray line, which reflects cash

256
00:15:44.321 --> 00:15:49.270
collected from customers, to this
blue line, which represents revenue?

257
00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:53.035
Well this orange line, deferred revenue,
is how you smooth it out.

258
00:15:53.035 --> 00:15:54.409
So when times are good,

259
00:15:54.409 --> 00:15:58.440
you can use unearned revenue to
smooth out the revenue growth.

260
00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:02.865
When times are bad, you can take things
out of unearned revenue to continue to

261
00:16:02.865 --> 00:16:07.921
smooth revenue growth, and that's what it
looks like DoggieSoft has been doing here.

262
00:16:10.651 --> 00:16:15.088
>> Let's say that the company decided to
issue a new software patch in the very

263
00:16:15.088 --> 00:16:17.650
year that they needed more revenue.

264
00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:19.960
Would that be considered
a so-called manipulation?

265
00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:22.470
>> Excellent point.

266
00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:25.490
And that example
highlights just how tricky

267
00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:28.310
it is to detect earnings management.

268
00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:31.660
And how very different earnings
management is from outright fraud.

269
00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:34.830
If a company decides to
issue a software patch,

270
00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:38.230
then it completely makes sense that they
would recognize the unearned revenue

271
00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:40.310
associated with the delivery
of that software patch.

272
00:16:41.310 --> 00:16:45.720
But if they decided to deliver the
software patch in a quarter only because

273
00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:48.355
they're trying to smooth over
loss in sales elsewhere,

274
00:16:48.355 --> 00:16:51.450
then they are being misleading
in their disclosure.

275
00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:56.200
And the SEC and shareholders have
brought suits against companies for

276
00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:58.110
misleading disclosure.

277
00:16:58.110 --> 00:17:00.140
You can't get them on violating
the accounting rules,

278
00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:04.500
because the accounting is matching
the business transaction.

279
00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:07.810
But the allegation is that they're
timing the business transaction

280
00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:10.370
in a way to make their financial
statements look better

281
00:17:10.370 --> 00:17:14.239
than it would be if they hadn't tried to
manipulate the timing of the transaction.

282
00:17:15.810 --> 00:17:19.070
That wraps up our look at
revenue manipulations.

283
00:17:19.070 --> 00:17:22.680
And again, these are a big deal because
about half the companies that get

284
00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:26.650
busted by the FCC for
aggressive reporting are busted for

285
00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:30.150
violations of these revenue
recognition criteria.

286
00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:34.214
In the next video, we're gonna turn to
the other part of the income statement to

287
00:17:34.214 --> 00:17:37.552
look at another type of way that
you can manipulate earnings, and

288
00:17:37.552 --> 00:17:39.753
that's through expense manipulations.

289
00:17:39.753 --> 00:17:40.519
I'll see you then.

290
00:17:42.097 --> 00:17:43.573
>> See you next video.
