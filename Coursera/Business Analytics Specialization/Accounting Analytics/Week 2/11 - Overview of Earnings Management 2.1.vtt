00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.200
Hello, professor Brian Bushee,
welcome back,

2
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.250
in this video we're going to to talk
about incentives for earnings management.

3
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.707
Earnings management is where managers
do something in their business or

4
00:00:14.707 --> 00:00:18.515
in their counting choices to try to make
the financial statements look better.

5
00:00:18.515 --> 00:00:20.390
As we go through the next few videos,

6
00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.324
we're going to talk about different tools
that managers could use to try to make

7
00:00:24.324 --> 00:00:27.420
their financial statement
numbers look better.

8
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.650
But as we do so, it's important to keep
in mind what factors would make a manager

9
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.090
want to manipulate their
financial statement results and

10
00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.050
how could they get away with it.

11
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:37.810
Let's get started.

12
00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.890
Let's start with a definition
of Earnings Management.

13
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.010
So Earnings Management occurs
when managers use judgment

14
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.560
in financial reporting and in structuring
transactions to either mislead some

15
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.950
stakeholders about the underlying
economic performance of the company.

16
00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.630
Or to influence contractual outcomes that
depend on reported accounting numbers.

17
00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.930
In other words, Earnings Management is
one managers intentionally tried to

18
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.110
change the financial statement,
to make them with better to outsiders.

19
00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.005
>> Earnings Management,
sounds like a euphemism for FRAUD!

20
00:01:16.005 --> 00:01:19.242
>> Yes, if I cheated on a test,
I would say that,

21
00:01:19.242 --> 00:01:21.737
I just did some answer management.

22
00:01:21.737 --> 00:01:23.060
>> You're right.

23
00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.946
Earnings management is
a bit of a euphemism but

24
00:01:25.946 --> 00:01:28.540
I don't want to call it fraud.

25
00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.630
What I consider fraud is when managers
just make stuff up so they ship empty

26
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.820
boxes and call it sales, or they just out
and out change the numbers in the ledger.

27
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.880
Earnings management on the other
hand is almost always legal.

28
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.690
It's almost always within the rules.

29
00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.280
Because the accounting system
provides managers a lot of discretion

30
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.480
in timing their transactions or
making estimates and so

31
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.660
they can choose among our
range of assumptions.

32
00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.220
A set of assumptions that would
give them the best results.

33
00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.100
That's what we call earnings
management and it's not fraud.

34
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.399
It's totally within the rules.

35
00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.800
To try to detect earnings management,
we're going to look for means, motive and

36
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:08.460
opportunity.

37
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.170
So Motive is the answer to the question
why do managers feel the need to

38
00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.500
manipulate earnings during a given period.

39
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.930
For Means, we're going to look for
what changes do managers make to their

40
00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.840
reporting decisions or their transactions
in order to actually manipulate earnings.

41
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.140
And for Opportunity,
we're looking when are managers able to

42
00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.550
get away with earnings management
without being immediately caught.

43
00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.714
Before we get into means, motive and
opportunity in more detail let me give you

44
00:02:36.714 --> 00:02:39.651
an example of what I'm talking about
with this earnings management.

45
00:02:39.651 --> 00:02:42.318
So we're going to have reported earnings.

46
00:02:42.318 --> 00:02:45.160
That's what's going to show up in
the final income statement and

47
00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.442
get reported to all the outsiders.

48
00:02:47.442 --> 00:02:50.020
That's going to be equal
to unmanaged earnings

49
00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.980
which is what earnings would be if
managers did not try to mislead outsiders.

50
00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.251
Plus managed earnings which
is the misleading part.

51
00:02:57.251 --> 00:03:00.978
So let's say unmanaged earnings
are expected to be $10,000.

52
00:03:00.978 --> 00:03:03.508
And that includes bad
debt expense of 1,000.

53
00:03:03.508 --> 00:03:07.796
Remember bad debt expense is the company's
estimate of how much of accounts

54
00:03:07.796 --> 00:03:11.950
receivable it won't be able to collect
because customers default on what

55
00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:12.559
they owe.

56
00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.003
The Bad Debt Expense is based on a good
faith estimate that 1% of credit sales

57
00:03:18.003 --> 00:03:21.227
will not be collected given
the nature the customer base and

58
00:03:21.227 --> 00:03:23.114
the current state of the economy.

59
00:03:23.114 --> 00:03:27.332
The manager though,
wants reported earnings to be $10,500 and

60
00:03:27.332 --> 00:03:29.870
right not they're only $10,000.

61
00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.629
Now, we'll talk about reasons
why on the next slide.

62
00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.410
So the manager's going to need to
create managed earnings of $500.

63
00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.889
So the manager intentionally changes
Bed Debt Estimate to be only 0.5% so

64
00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:46.000
that Bad Debt Expense is only 500.

65
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.740
So that means that lower expense

66
00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:52.750
is going to result in a positive
Managed Earnings of $500.

67
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.698
And I want to note that I'm ignoring all
the tax expense to make the math easier

68
00:03:56.698 --> 00:03:57.692
for this example.

69
00:03:57.692 --> 00:04:01.525
So now, reported earnings will be $10,500.

70
00:04:01.525 --> 00:04:06.392
The $10,000 unmanaged plus the 500
managed that the manager gets by

71
00:04:06.392 --> 00:04:09.500
manipulating the estimate for
Bad Debt Expense.

72
00:04:12.135 --> 00:04:13.333
Seriously?

73
00:04:13.333 --> 00:04:14.935
This sounds illegal to me.

74
00:04:14.935 --> 00:04:19.117
>> And wouldn't we all notice
this change and figure it out!

75
00:04:19.117 --> 00:04:22.019
>> Again this is not illegal.

76
00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:26.537
The accounting system gives managers the
discretion to change these estimates at

77
00:04:26.537 --> 00:04:27.199
any point.

78
00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:33.040
Now, if a court of law got ahold of a set
of emails from managers saying, hey,

79
00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.460
let's change the estimate for

80
00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.670
the sole reason of making our earnings
look better and fooling shareholders.

81
00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:42.350
Then the management team could get
charged with securities fraud misleading

82
00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:43.120
disclosure.

83
00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.780
But they're still really not
violating any accounting rules.

84
00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.263
So I guess the key is don't put anything
in writing and you can get away with this.

85
00:04:49.263 --> 00:04:51.520
As far as how do you get away with it?

86
00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.740
How do outsiders not catch this?

87
00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.350
Well we'll talk about those factors
a little bit later in the video.

88
00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.720
So now let's talk about Motives for
Earnings Management.

89
00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.200
For managers to have a motive
to manipulate earnings,

90
00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.810
the following two conditions have to hold.

91
00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:13.260
First, Unmanaged Earnings have to be
expected to be different than some target.

92
00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.484
And by different they
could either be too low,

93
00:05:15.484 --> 00:05:18.677
where the manager would need to do
managed earnings to raise them,

94
00:05:18.677 --> 00:05:22.401
or they could be too high where the
manager wants to lower reported earnings.

95
00:05:22.401 --> 00:05:26.620
And the target could be based
on stakeholder expectations.

96
00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.260
So maybe analysts are expecting
a certain earnings per share or

97
00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.445
some kind of contractual or
requirement like a loan contract.

98
00:05:33.445 --> 00:05:39.440
The second condition is that managers
would get some benefit by earnings

99
00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:44.130
management to make reported earnings
look better than the unmanaged earnings.

100
00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:49.230
So the idea here is that some stakeholder
group would react less positively, or more

101
00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:54.340
negatively, to unmanaged earnings, than to
reported earnings that have been managed.

102
00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:58.820
So, in other words,
somebody like an investor would react

103
00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:02.300
positively if they saw reported earnings,
and the dollar per share.

104
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.800
But less positively or more negatively if
they saw reported earnings of 95 cents per

105
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.130
share, so the manager has that
incentive to make earnings

106
00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:14.530
five cents per share higher to get this
kind of benefit from their investors.

107
00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:19.640
Common earnings targets that we found
that managers shoot for, earnings for

108
00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:21.290
the same quarter last year.

109
00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:24.347
Security analysts forecasts of earnings.

110
00:06:24.347 --> 00:06:27.763
And as I mentioned contractual targets so
there may be something in

111
00:06:27.763 --> 00:06:32.350
a loan covenant that requires a certain
level of earnings or retained earnings.

112
00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:36.480
And bonus compensation contracts
often specify earnings targets.

113
00:06:37.992 --> 00:06:42.130
So want to show you one piece of
research to show you this phenomenon.

114
00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:46.290
So this was done by Dave Burghstahler and
Ilia Dichev.

115
00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:50.730
On the x axis, we have the change in
earnings from this year to last year.

116
00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:55.520
So 0 means it was the same earnings
this year as the same quarter last year.

117
00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.220
Up here where it's .05 means that
earnings were five cents a share better,

118
00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:02.580
minus .05 earnings were
five cents a share worse.

119
00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:06.370
On the y axis you have the frequency
of the number of companies that report

120
00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:07.660
the change in earnings.

121
00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:11.680
So you notice it looks like this bell
shaped curve, or normal distribution.

122
00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:16.973
Except that there's a discontinuity
around 0, where just above 0 change you

123
00:07:16.973 --> 00:07:22.819
have more observations than you'd expect,
and then just below 0, you have this dip,

124
00:07:22.819 --> 00:07:28.270
which suggests that managers that would
have had a small negative change earnings

125
00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:33.899
are doing something to make their earnings
become a small positive change instead.

126
00:07:33.899 --> 00:07:37.760
>> Maybe people just work harder
when they are close to the target.

127
00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:41.090
>> Or surely this is a mere
artifact of some arcane rule.

128
00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:46.320
>> Yeah, economic research has spent
a lot of time trying to show that this

129
00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:50.580
discontinuity is due to something
other than earnings management.

130
00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:55.020
But by and large most of us at this
point believe that this is evidence of

131
00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:59.150
managers trying to manipulate to
avoid small changes in earning.

132
00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:02.370
But one key point, and
I'm going to bring the graph back up here.

133
00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:05.870
Is that not every manager with a small
change in earnings is trying to

134
00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:06.530
manipulate.

135
00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:09.190
Look, there's still a lot of
companies that have small,

136
00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:11.480
negative changes in earnings.

137
00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:16.510
And that's because you have to have
very strong incentives in a given period

138
00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:19.370
to want to manipulate
your earnings upward.

139
00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:22.270
And that's what we're going to talk
about next is what are the sources

140
00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:25.090
of these very strong incentives
to manipulate your earnings.

141
00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:29.530
So now, let's talk about the specific
sources of these motives

142
00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:30.617
to manage earnings.

143
00:08:30.617 --> 00:08:35.390
The first and the biggest source,
I think, is the capital market.

144
00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:41.500
So investors and analysts who use earnings
either directly to determine stock price,

145
00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:44.200
because they evaluate companies
based on price earnings multiples.

146
00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:46.930
So higher earnings would
mean higher stock price.

147
00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:50.540
Or indirectly, they use earnings
to forecast future cash flow.

148
00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:54.900
So if earnings are managed upward,
the forecast of future cash flows will be

149
00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:57.220
higher, and
the company stock price will be higher.

150
00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:02.460
In the product and labor markets,
we have customers, competitors, suppliers,

151
00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:06.180
employees that use earnings as a key
measure of firm performance and

152
00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:07.350
financial health.

153
00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:12.200
So a supplier might be more likely to do
business with a company that's profitable

154
00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.180
than a company that has losses.

155
00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:17.050
Giving that company incentives to
make their earnings look better.

156
00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:19.980
Contracts.

157
00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:25.409
So, lenders like banks or bond agreements,
board of directors who set executive

158
00:09:25.409 --> 00:09:30.998
compensation will often write contracts
that explicitly use earnings to determine

159
00:09:30.998 --> 00:09:35.895
rewards like bonuses, or penalties
like covenant violations on a loan.

160
00:09:35.895 --> 00:09:38.250
And finally, Regulators.

161
00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:42.760
So, industry regulators like the banking
industry or utility industry, the justice

162
00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:48.200
department, Congress, they use earnings
to try to detect monopoly activity.

163
00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:51.840
And to trigger bail out actions,
which means that sometimes

164
00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:55.460
companies may have incentives to
make their earnings look worse.

165
00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:57.980
In order to get a bail out from congress.

166
00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:02.060
So now lets talk about Means.

167
00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:04.320
How Can Managers actually
Manipulate their Earnings?

168
00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:07.930
And there's basically two
big ways they could do it.

169
00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:11.860
The first is called accrual-based
earnings management.

170
00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:15.100
This would be where managers
use aggressive revenue or

171
00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:17.100
expense recognition policies.

172
00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:21.355
So they use the flexibility and
discretion within revenue recognition and

173
00:10:21.355 --> 00:10:25.341
expense recognition to try to
accelerate revenues into this period or

174
00:10:25.341 --> 00:10:27.519
delay expenses into a future period.

175
00:10:27.519 --> 00:10:32.335
They also could change accounting choices
or estimates, so managers have to make

176
00:10:32.335 --> 00:10:36.941
a lot of estimates like how much of
accounts receivable won't be collected and

177
00:10:36.941 --> 00:10:38.366
will become bad debts.

178
00:10:38.366 --> 00:10:45.070
Or how long to depreciate or amortize
a tangible asset or an intangible asset.

179
00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:48.020
And you could tweak these estimates
to make your earnings look better.

180
00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:53.020
The other form is what is called
real earnings management.

181
00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:57.390
This is where the manager actually
changes some operational decision so

182
00:10:57.390 --> 00:11:01.054
they'll delay R&D expense to
make their earnings higher.

183
00:11:01.054 --> 00:11:05.825
Or they'll overproduce inventory,
which will reduce the cost per unit,

184
00:11:05.825 --> 00:11:09.470
which makes cost of goods sold go down and
earnings go up.

185
00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:17.850
>> Real earnings management sounds like
another of those euphrates things.

186
00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:19.060
What does it mean?

187
00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:20.760
>> You mean euphemism.

188
00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:21.930
>> Zut Alors indeed.

189
00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:27.610
>> It's called real earnings management
because it involves some kind of

190
00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:29.980
real outlay of cash.

191
00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:33.120
Either you're spending more cash
than you should this period, or

192
00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:36.030
you're delaying cash
expenditures till next period or

193
00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:39.850
cutting cash expenditures altogether,
in order to manipulate.

194
00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:43.210
That's different from a cruel earnings
management which just can be done by

195
00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:44.480
changing assumptions,

196
00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:48.890
it can basically be done on paper, you
don't have to do any real transactions.

197
00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:49.610
So as a result,

198
00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:54.130
real earnings management has to be done
during the quarter, whereas a cruel

199
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:58.430
earnings management could be due at 5
o'clock PM on the last day of the period.

200
00:11:58.430 --> 00:12:01.292
because all you're doing is
changing some assumptions on paper.

201
00:12:01.292 --> 00:12:04.910
Finally, let's talk about opportunity.

202
00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:08.540
So when can managers pull off
this earnings management?

203
00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:11.650
So, for managers to be able to have
the opportunity to successfully manipulate

204
00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:14.630
their earnings,
there have to be two conditions in place.

205
00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:19.300
First, the expected benefits of earning
management are greater than the expected

206
00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:20.350
costs.

207
00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:22.060
So earnings management's not free.

208
00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:23.920
If it was, everybody would do it.

209
00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:26.880
There are costs that managers have
to trade off if they're thinking of

210
00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:28.710
manipulating their earnings.

211
00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:33.730
So, a big source of costs are litigation
or reputation costs if you get caught.

212
00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:36.150
If you get caught, you could get sued.

213
00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:38.250
Or you could lose your reputation and

214
00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:40.189
never be able to work in
the business world again.

215
00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:44.920
Also, borrowing earnings from
the future may be costly.

216
00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:48.260
So if you do things to make
earnings higher this period, but

217
00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:52.590
it hurts future earnings,
that may create a huge problem for

218
00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:55.800
you next year that you would
have trouble dealing with.

219
00:12:55.800 --> 00:13:00.340
So not surprisingly, researchers found
that managers that are close to retirement

220
00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:04.800
age are more likely to manipulate
earnings because the cost of the future

221
00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:07.130
being bad is almost zero for
them, because they're retiring.

222
00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:11.620
The second commission is that
stakeholders are not able to see through

223
00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:15.319
the earnings management and
back out this true unmanaged earnings.

224
00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:20.550
So what we're going to try to do through
these videos is spot earnings management.

225
00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:25.360
But a good question is, if we can spot it,
why can't stakeholders spot it as well?

226
00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:29.170
Well, some reasons are that managers
could obfuscate in the disclosures.

227
00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:32.506
They could try to do things to hide it and
we'll try to see through that.

228
00:13:32.506 --> 00:13:37.360
Investors could have limited attention and
fixate on the reported numbers so

229
00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:40.280
they're following a large
number of stocks.

230
00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:43.900
And so they don't have time to dig
in all the details like we will.

231
00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:45.907
And so
they just fixate on the reported earnings.

232
00:13:45.907 --> 00:13:49.860
Or stakeholders don't want to jeopardize
relationships with management by

233
00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:51.490
questioning their behavior.

234
00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:53.160
So if you're a supplier and

235
00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:56.900
a customer it's an uncomfortable
conversation to accuse

236
00:13:56.900 --> 00:14:01.610
the company of manipulating earnings if it
may not be true and so they don't do it.

237
00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:04.800
So, those are reasons that
managers may get away with it and

238
00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:08.010
we're going to do our best to try
to see through these situations.

239
00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:11.810
So, couple things in conclusion.

240
00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:14.490
All these earning manipulations
are context-specific

241
00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:18.180
which means there's no universal tool
that will allow you to spot manipulated

242
00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:20.240
financial statements across the board.

243
00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:23.510
Instead we're going to have to
look at a larger range of tools

244
00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:26.940
because there's a different tool for
each different type of manipulation.

245
00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:31.830
And detecting manipulation requires
a consideration of motive,

246
00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:34.990
does the manager have incentives
to manipulate this period?

247
00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:38.280
Means, what items in the financial
statements look unusual and

248
00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:40.330
may have been used to manipulate.

249
00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:44.260
And opportunity, are there factors in
place that would allow managers to get

250
00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.170
away with the earnings
management disk period.

251
00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:50.900
As we go through the rest
of the videos you want to

252
00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:55.500
keep in mind these earning management
motives, means and opportunities.

253
00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:58.060
We're going to look at all
of these cool tools that

254
00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:01.340
people can use to try to
detect earnings management.

255
00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:03.930
But sometimes these tools will
look like earnings management

256
00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:05.950
when everything is legitimate.

257
00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:10.160
That's why you need to look at
a combination of the tools and

258
00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.440
these motives, means, and opportunities.

259
00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:14.100
If both line up,

260
00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:18.570
then it's more likely that you caught
a manager manipulating his earnings.

261
00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:19.320
I'll see you next time.

262
00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:21.968
>> See you next video!
