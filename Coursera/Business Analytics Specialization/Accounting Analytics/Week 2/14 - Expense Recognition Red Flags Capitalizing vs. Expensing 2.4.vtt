00:00:03.527 --> 00:00:04.571
>> Hello, I'm Professor Brian Bushee.

2
00:00:04.571 --> 00:00:05.768
Welcome back.

3
00:00:05.768 --> 00:00:06.733
In this video,

4
00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:11.489
we're gonna start to take a look at
expense manipulations in which managers

5
00:00:11.489 --> 00:00:17.080
try to play with the timing of expenses
in order to manipulate their earnings.

6
00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.600
We're gonna take a look at capitalization
versus expensing immediately.

7
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.920
These are situations where a company has
some kind of big cash cost this period and

8
00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:32.020
they can either expense it all right away
or they could capitalize it into an asset

9
00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.030
and then amortize the expense over
time to try to smooth out the expense.

10
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.693
Let's get started.

11
00:00:39.693 --> 00:00:43.511
Before we get into the capitalization
versus expense immediately,

12
00:00:43.511 --> 00:00:45.629
let's do a quick review of expenses.

13
00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.211
So expenses are decreases in net income,

14
00:00:48.211 --> 00:00:52.731
not necessarily cash that arise in
the process of generating revenues.

15
00:00:52.731 --> 00:00:56.960
We recognize expenses when either
the related revenues are recognized,

16
00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.469
these are product costs.

17
00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.968
Cost that become expenses when
we sell the product or service.

18
00:01:02.968 --> 00:01:06.673
So this technically shows up as cost,
if its sold on the income statement.

19
00:01:06.673 --> 00:01:10.285
Or they're recognized when incurred, if
they're difficult to match with revenues.

20
00:01:10.285 --> 00:01:13.803
These are period costs the selling,
general and administrative costs.

21
00:01:13.803 --> 00:01:16.860
So, all the other costs
of running a business.

22
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.065
Many expense related manipulations
create a huge gap between expenses and

23
00:01:21.065 --> 00:01:24.333
cash flows and we can see part
of this on the balance sheet,

24
00:01:24.333 --> 00:01:28.091
because there's gonna be accounts for
these capitalized costs.

25
00:01:28.091 --> 00:01:31.989
Basically, storing up these costs
until they hit the income statement.

26
00:01:31.989 --> 00:01:34.309
And there's also gonna
be reserve accounts,

27
00:01:34.309 --> 00:01:36.160
which we'll talk about next video.

28
00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.495
We're gonna take a look at the Statement
of Cash Flows where we can see the gap

29
00:01:40.495 --> 00:01:44.496
between net income and cash from
operations that's caused by expense

30
00:01:44.496 --> 00:01:47.141
related manipulations and about 35% of SEC

31
00:01:47.141 --> 00:01:51.788
enforcement actions are related to
questions around recognition of expenses.

32
00:01:51.788 --> 00:01:53.460
So this is a big deal also.

33
00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.732
So we're gonna look at this
question of capitalization versus

34
00:01:57.732 --> 00:01:59.550
expensing immediately.

35
00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.960
Capitalization means the company creates
an asset when the cash is paid and

36
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.380
then amortizes it or
expenses it over time.

37
00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.906
The alternative is to just recognize
an expense when cash is paid and so

38
00:02:09.906 --> 00:02:12.977
this is the choice that
companies's managers have to make.

39
00:02:15.741 --> 00:02:20.381
>> My sister once told me that the rules
are quite explicit about whether

40
00:02:20.381 --> 00:02:23.021
a company may capitalize a cost or not.

41
00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.987
>> Your sister is exactly right,
the standard setters have created a lot of

42
00:02:29.987 --> 00:02:33.710
explicit guidance on how
expenditures must be treated.

43
00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:35.960
For example, research and development and

44
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.729
advertising has to be expensed
immediately, but there's still are a lot

45
00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:43.460
of these expenditures where
the rules provide discretion.

46
00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.490
For example,
whether something is maintenance or

47
00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.730
a capital improvement, whether it's
a software development cost before or

48
00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.160
after something called
technological feasibility.

49
00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.102
And then companies will occasionally
have these customer acquisition costs,

50
00:02:57.102 --> 00:03:00.511
where the guidance is not clear on
whether it should be capitalized or

51
00:03:00.511 --> 00:03:01.767
expensed immediately.

52
00:03:01.767 --> 00:03:06.676
So there's still a lot of expenditures
where managers have the room to make these

53
00:03:06.676 --> 00:03:09.649
determinations on when
you expense something.

54
00:03:11.961 --> 00:03:14.728
Let's look at an example
to see how this works.

55
00:03:14.728 --> 00:03:19.686
So let's say, a company spends $120 in
2016 on software development costs and

56
00:03:19.686 --> 00:03:24.175
this is one area where managers have some
discretion of whether to capitalize or

57
00:03:24.175 --> 00:03:26.160
expense immediately.

58
00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.720
And let's say that costs have
a three-year benefit for

59
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.400
generating revenue, so
whatever software you're developing

60
00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.280
should help you make sales
over the next three years.

61
00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.220
If the company capitalizes,
then in 2016 as they pay 120 cash,

62
00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.939
they would create an asset called
deferred software development costs.

63
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.277
And then in 2016, 2017 and
2018 at the end of the year,

64
00:03:48.277 --> 00:03:52.624
they would recognize an expense of 40 and
reduce the asset by 40.

65
00:03:52.624 --> 00:03:56.482
So they're spreading those
costs over three years.

66
00:03:56.482 --> 00:04:01.706
If they expense immediately,
then in 2016 as they pay the cash,

67
00:04:01.706 --> 00:04:05.129
they would recognize an expense of 120 and

68
00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:08.478
there would be no expense
the next 2 years.

69
00:04:08.478 --> 00:04:11.854
So the more the company capitalizes,

70
00:04:11.854 --> 00:04:16.294
the smaller its expense
will be in the first year.

71
00:04:16.294 --> 00:04:17.933
Once you decide to capitalize,

72
00:04:17.933 --> 00:04:21.159
then the question is what do you
do with amortization periods?

73
00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:25.170
Now, these should reflect the period over
which costs will help generate revenues.

74
00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:30.142
So we saw the example of a three year life
where we spread the cost over three years.

75
00:04:30.142 --> 00:04:34.383
If the manager decided to lengthen
the period, it would reduce expenses in

76
00:04:34.383 --> 00:04:37.632
the early years, but
it would add more years of expense.

77
00:04:37.632 --> 00:04:40.762
So let's say,
you decided to do four years instead.

78
00:04:40.762 --> 00:04:45.880
What it does in the first three years
is reduce your expense by 10 from

79
00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:51.282
40 down to 30, but then give you
an extra expense of 30 in 2019.

80
00:04:51.282 --> 00:04:54.244
Shortening the periods with
increase expenses, but

81
00:04:54.244 --> 00:04:56.561
then resolved in fewer years of expense.

82
00:04:56.561 --> 00:04:58.772
So if the company did a two-year life,

83
00:04:58.772 --> 00:05:02.259
then their expenses would be
higher in those first two years.

84
00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:06.890
They would have 60 instead of 40,
so an extra 20 of expense, but

85
00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:10.039
then there would be no expense after 2017.

86
00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:12.944
So by choosing the amortization period,

87
00:05:12.944 --> 00:05:18.339
the manager can essentially choose how
they spread this expense over time and

88
00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:22.577
what the level of their expense
would be in the current year.

89
00:05:22.577 --> 00:05:23.819
>> Seriously?

90
00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:27.419
There must be a law that says,
how long you can amortize something.

91
00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:30.893
>> If not,
you could change the period every year,

92
00:05:30.893 --> 00:05:35.149
depending on whether you wanted higher or
lower earnings.

93
00:05:35.149 --> 00:05:39.114
>> No, there is no law that
says the exact number of

94
00:05:39.114 --> 00:05:43.488
years that you have to use
to amortize a given asset.

95
00:05:43.488 --> 00:05:49.146
Instead, what the rules say is that you
should amortized it over its useful life,

96
00:05:49.146 --> 00:05:53.170
which means how long the asset
is gonna generate revenue?

97
00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:54.979
So how long, in this case,

98
00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:58.690
these capitalize costs will
help you produce revenue?

99
00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:03.157
That is context specific, it differs based
on firms, it differs based on assets.

100
00:06:03.157 --> 00:06:07.666
So there can't be a law that centralizes
this, but that doesn't mean you could

101
00:06:07.666 --> 00:06:11.721
change your assumptions for
the number of periods each and every year.

102
00:06:11.721 --> 00:06:16.259
To change your period, you have to justify
to your auditor why circumstances have

103
00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:19.482
changed, which would call for
a different useful life and

104
00:06:19.482 --> 00:06:22.725
the auditor will probably let
you get away with that once.

105
00:06:22.725 --> 00:06:25.984
But then if you come back the next
year and wanna change it again and

106
00:06:25.984 --> 00:06:30.090
then try to change it again and again and
again, the auditor will probably say no.

107
00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:34.206
So you get maybe one opportunity to
change the amortization period and

108
00:06:34.206 --> 00:06:38.740
the auditor will be okay, but the auditor
is there to prevent the company from

109
00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.340
changing these periods every single year.

110
00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:46.321
Here are the red flags we're gonna use
to look for aggressive capitalization or

111
00:06:46.321 --> 00:06:47.968
amortization behavior.

112
00:06:47.968 --> 00:06:51.518
So look at the ratio of the deferred
cost assets to total assets.

113
00:06:51.518 --> 00:06:53.422
So, are these assets getting bigger?

114
00:06:53.422 --> 00:06:56.696
If so,
the company's capitalizing more costs.

115
00:06:56.696 --> 00:06:59.343
The ratio of amortization
expense to revenue.

116
00:06:59.343 --> 00:07:01.433
Is this ratio getting smaller?

117
00:07:01.433 --> 00:07:06.242
If so, the company's spreading
out the amortization over more

118
00:07:06.242 --> 00:07:08.653
periods to reduce the expense.

119
00:07:08.653 --> 00:07:09.977
The average amortization period.

120
00:07:09.977 --> 00:07:13.115
So we can calculate something
called months amortization,

121
00:07:13.115 --> 00:07:17.312
which is the average asset balance
divided by amortization expense times 12.

122
00:07:17.312 --> 00:07:21.059
So this is similar to the day receivable
days inventory ratios that we looked at

123
00:07:21.059 --> 00:07:23.409
earlier, except here we
are looking at months.

124
00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:29.890
The gap between net income and cash flow,
because these capitalization, amortization

125
00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:34.070
strategies create a bigger gap between
net income and cash from operations.

126
00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:38.546
And we can calculate what
the company's net income would be,

127
00:07:38.546 --> 00:07:40.249
if they expensed immediately.

128
00:07:40.249 --> 00:07:43.322
So that is gonna be equal to
the net income that they report,

129
00:07:43.322 --> 00:07:46.159
which reflects the capitalization,
amortization.

130
00:07:46.159 --> 00:07:50.451
We'll add back the amortization expense
that removes it from net income.

131
00:07:50.451 --> 00:07:52.126
We'll subtract the cash cost.

132
00:07:52.126 --> 00:07:56.098
Because if the company was expensing
immediately, the cash cost would be

133
00:07:56.098 --> 00:07:59.888
the expense for the year and
then we have to subtract a tax adjustment.

134
00:07:59.888 --> 00:08:03.371
And the tax adjustment is just
the difference between the amortization

135
00:08:03.371 --> 00:08:06.746
expense and the cause cost times
whatever the companies tax rate is.

136
00:08:09.659 --> 00:08:12.132
>> Dude, why do you need a tax adjustment?

137
00:08:12.132 --> 00:08:14.558
I like it better when
we like ignore taxes.

138
00:08:14.558 --> 00:08:17.595
>> I like ignoring taxes, as well.

139
00:08:17.595 --> 00:08:21.002
But unfortunately,
we can't ignore taxes in this situation.

140
00:08:21.002 --> 00:08:25.183
The problem is that net income
is an after tax number, but

141
00:08:25.183 --> 00:08:29.378
the amortization expense and
the cash costs are pretax.

142
00:08:29.378 --> 00:08:34.297
So we need to include a tax adjustment
to figure out what's the tax effect of

143
00:08:34.297 --> 00:08:35.866
changing the expense.

144
00:08:35.866 --> 00:08:40.107
We can include that tax effect
with the pretax and the expense.

145
00:08:40.107 --> 00:08:44.425
Add that to net income and we get net
income, if we expensed immediately.

146
00:08:46.813 --> 00:08:50.378
Now, let's practice applying
these red flags in a case.

147
00:08:50.378 --> 00:08:53.760
The case we're going to look at
is Dog Nutrition Associates,

148
00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:56.710
they're a custom dog food provider.

149
00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:59.974
Customers use saliva swabs
to collect the dog's DNA and

150
00:08:59.974 --> 00:09:02.484
then they send the results to the company.

151
00:09:02.484 --> 00:09:07.027
The company then, custom crafts
the food to the dog's DNA profile and

152
00:09:07.027 --> 00:09:09.656
sends the food to the customers weekly.

153
00:09:09.656 --> 00:09:12.972
The company aggressively markets its
product by sending free DNA kits in

154
00:09:12.972 --> 00:09:16.250
the mail to people, regardless of
whether they requested them or not.

155
00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:20.585
And the hope is that people will
decide to use this free DNA kit and

156
00:09:20.585 --> 00:09:24.449
then become subscribers to
the weekly dog food service.

157
00:09:26.301 --> 00:09:30.568
>> My gosh, this company cannot be real.

158
00:09:30.568 --> 00:09:34.382
>> You don't remember their commercials
where they would use cute kids to try to

159
00:09:34.382 --> 00:09:35.624
promote their product?

160
00:09:35.624 --> 00:09:37.064
Here, I think I have a clip from one.

161
00:09:39.999 --> 00:09:43.656
>> Is your dog not eating right or
not as energetic anymore?

162
00:09:43.656 --> 00:09:48.395
Try our specially formulated dog food,
using our free doggie DNA kit.

163
00:09:48.395 --> 00:09:50.969
It will be sent by mail to your home.

164
00:09:50.969 --> 00:09:56.160
Send your dog's DNA sample to the Dog
Nutrition Associates or the DNA, so we can

165
00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:01.290
craft the perfect dog food that is both
nutritious and delicious for your dog.

166
00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:03.684
All it takes is a lick or a cheek swab.

167
00:10:03.684 --> 00:10:08.550
After you mail the DNA, every week,
you will receive a specially made dog

168
00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:12.252
food with an ingredient list
on what goes into the food.

169
00:10:12.252 --> 00:10:15.541
It only costs as little as 29.99 a week.

170
00:10:15.541 --> 00:10:19.329
It is the small price to pay for
the best nutrients for your dog.

171
00:10:19.329 --> 00:10:23.979
For more information,
go to our website dna.aol.com and

172
00:10:23.979 --> 00:10:26.678
keep watching for your kit today.

173
00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:31.983
>> So the company had it's initial
Public Offering in 2011 and

174
00:10:31.983 --> 00:10:35.220
had to file 10-K with SEC at that point.

175
00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:39.504
The accounting guidance was not clear
about whether the marketing cost for

176
00:10:39.504 --> 00:10:42.098
the DNA kits had to be
expensed immediately.

177
00:10:42.098 --> 00:10:46.199
Regular advertising, all the other
marketing expenditures did have to be

178
00:10:46.199 --> 00:10:50.639
expensed immediately, but there was no
guidance that was specific to DNA kits.

179
00:10:50.639 --> 00:10:54.979
So the company decided to capitalize these
as Deferred Subscriber Acquisition costs

180
00:10:54.979 --> 00:10:59.430
and amortize them over the expected
period they would generate revenue.

181
00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:02.430
The expected average period was 12 months.

182
00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:09.600
Let's take a look at the spreadsheet where
I've summarized the financial statements

183
00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:12.120
for Dog Nutrition Associates.

184
00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:14.920
If you look at their balance sheet,
here you can see

185
00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:19.550
the Deferred Subscriber Acquisition costs,
which are growing over the two years.

186
00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:24.460
If you look at the income statement, you
won't see the amortization of these costs

187
00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:28.210
anywhere, because they're included
within costs of revenues.

188
00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:31.766
So the only place that we can find the
amount of these costs is on the cash flow

189
00:11:31.766 --> 00:11:32.391
statement.

190
00:11:32.391 --> 00:11:37.408
They report amortization of subscriber
acquisition costs, because it's a non

191
00:11:37.408 --> 00:11:42.366
cash expense that has to be added back to
net income to get cash from operations.

192
00:11:42.366 --> 00:11:46.989
And what we can also see here is the net
income for the company has been growing,

193
00:11:46.989 --> 00:11:48.542
3 million, 7 million.

194
00:11:48.542 --> 00:11:52.132
But if we look at their cash
provided by operations,

195
00:11:52.132 --> 00:11:56.060
it actually has dropped between 2011 and
2012.

196
00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:58.364
Now we can take a look
at some of these ratios.

197
00:11:58.364 --> 00:12:04.199
So Deferred Subscriber Acquisition cost to
total assets has grown from 17% to 21%,

198
00:12:04.199 --> 00:12:07.360
so they're capitalizing
cost at a higher rate.

199
00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:14.166
If we look at the expenses as a percent
of revenues, it's gone down overall.

200
00:12:14.166 --> 00:12:17.809
And we see the amortization
period has dropped slightly,

201
00:12:17.809 --> 00:12:22.434
although that's probably just
measurement error as the company grows.

202
00:12:22.434 --> 00:12:25.245
It looks like on average,
it's 10 or 11 months,

203
00:12:25.245 --> 00:12:28.560
which is close to the 12 months
the company says that it uses.

204
00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:33.050
I showed you before the gap between
that income and cash from operations,

205
00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:37.020
it's growing over time and then we can
calculate net income if the expense

206
00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:39.070
immediately where we take net income.

207
00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:41.329
We add back the expense.

208
00:12:41.329 --> 00:12:45.976
We subtract the cash payed for
Deferred Subscriber Acquisition cost and

209
00:12:45.976 --> 00:12:49.412
where we can find those is
on the cash flow statement.

210
00:12:49.412 --> 00:12:53.713
There's a line for
Deferred Subscriber Acquisition costs.

211
00:12:53.713 --> 00:12:57.842
Here's the amount of cash they're
spending, we can add those.

212
00:12:57.842 --> 00:13:02.323
Well, actually, subtract those in this
equation to the tax adjustment and

213
00:13:02.323 --> 00:13:06.524
we can see that if they expense
immediately that have net income that was

214
00:13:06.524 --> 00:13:08.640
negative and declining overtime.

215
00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:16.783
Analysts and investors were disappointed
by mixed results in 2012, whereas revenue

216
00:13:16.783 --> 00:13:22.378
was up 350%, net income was flat and cash
from operations was negative as we saw.

217
00:13:22.378 --> 00:13:27.254
At the start of FY2013, the company
changed its amortization policy based on

218
00:13:27.254 --> 00:13:29.740
changes in subscriber experience data.

219
00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:35.410
It turned out customers were maintaining
food subscriptions longer than expected.

220
00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:36.020
And so now,

221
00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:40.132
they would amortize Deferred Subscriber
Acquisition costs over 24 months.

222
00:13:40.132 --> 00:13:44.949
Let's take a look at how that would
affect their results in 2013.

223
00:13:44.949 --> 00:13:50.519
I have added the 2013
results to the spreadsheet.

224
00:13:50.519 --> 00:13:56.799
We can see that the Deferred Subscriber
Acquisition costs asset continues to grow.

225
00:13:56.799 --> 00:14:01.431
We can also see that revenues have grown
substantially, huge increase in 2013.

226
00:14:01.431 --> 00:14:07.771
We see that net income is also up
substantially from 7 to 30 million.

227
00:14:07.771 --> 00:14:13.109
We see the big increase in subscriber
acquisition cost expense that

228
00:14:13.109 --> 00:14:18.257
is being advertised and a huge
increase in the amount of cash costs

229
00:14:18.257 --> 00:14:24.832
spent to send out these DNA kits and the
cash operations is negative and declining.

230
00:14:24.832 --> 00:14:27.421
So let's take a look at the ratios.

231
00:14:27.421 --> 00:14:32.880
Now the Deferred Subscriber Acquisitions
cost asset is 40% of total assets,

232
00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:37.066
so they're capitalizing
an enormous amount of these costs.

233
00:14:37.066 --> 00:14:40.912
The expense has dropped
from 14 to 11% of revenue.

234
00:14:40.912 --> 00:14:45.472
And if we do the month's amortization,
we can see the evidence that they

235
00:14:45.472 --> 00:14:49.609
length of amortization period
has gone from 10 to 18 months.

236
00:14:49.609 --> 00:14:53.946
If we look at the gap between the incoming
cash flow as we saw, it's widening and

237
00:14:53.946 --> 00:14:57.983
then what would their net income look
like if they expensed immediately?

238
00:14:57.983 --> 00:15:02.574
Well, we add back the amortization,
subtract out the cost that they're

239
00:15:02.574 --> 00:15:06.571
spending during the year on these
DNA kits, adjust for taxes and

240
00:15:06.571 --> 00:15:07.990
they have a huge loss.

241
00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:09.288
So by capitalizing and

242
00:15:09.288 --> 00:15:13.397
amortizing, the company is showing
steadily increasing net income.

243
00:15:13.397 --> 00:15:19.518
If they're expensing immediately, they'd
show a steadily decreasing net loss.

244
00:15:19.518 --> 00:15:20.226
Analysts and

245
00:15:20.226 --> 00:15:24.148
investors were starting to notice what
we were noticing in the ratios and

246
00:15:24.148 --> 00:15:28.845
they started to criticize the company's
capitalization policy during 2014 So,

247
00:15:28.845 --> 00:15:33.309
the company decided to switch to expensing
immediately in the middle of the year.

248
00:15:33.309 --> 00:15:38.559
Basically, they caved into the demands
of these analysts and investors and

249
00:15:38.559 --> 00:15:44.149
they wrote off all of their Deferred
Subscriber Acquisition costs in 2014.

250
00:15:44.149 --> 00:15:49.581
>> Why would the company cave into
the demands of these nefarious analysts?

251
00:15:49.581 --> 00:15:51.242
>> Excellent question.

252
00:15:51.242 --> 00:15:55.641
So when a company is growing rapidly,
it's better off capitalizing and

253
00:15:55.641 --> 00:16:00.544
amortizing and that's because the expense
from the cash outlays is much greater

254
00:16:00.544 --> 00:16:03.788
than what the expense would
be if you capitalize it and

255
00:16:03.788 --> 00:16:07.220
smooth it over time with the amortizing.

256
00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:11.380
But when a company's growth slows down,
the situation actually reverses.

257
00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:16.450
The amortization expense, which represents
the past cash outlays can get bigger

258
00:16:16.450 --> 00:16:20.490
than what the expense would be if you just
did it based on current cash outlays and

259
00:16:20.490 --> 00:16:23.040
that's a situation
the company's gotten into.

260
00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:25.640
It's realized that it's
growth has slowed and

261
00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:30.002
it's gonna be stuck now with these huge
amortization expenses going forward.

262
00:16:30.002 --> 00:16:34.251
So, it takes advantage of
the controversy to write off this asset.

263
00:16:34.251 --> 00:16:37.680
The asset disappears, which means it
no longer has to worry about those

264
00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:40.410
amortization expenses off into the future.

265
00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:44.100
Instead, it will just expense
immediately when it spends cash.

266
00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:49.366
And in doing so, actually have higher
earnings than if they capitalized and

267
00:16:49.366 --> 00:16:51.349
amortized into the future.

268
00:16:51.349 --> 00:16:54.115
So if we bring up
the spreadsheet one more time,

269
00:16:54.115 --> 00:16:57.090
I've added 2014 column
to the spreadsheet and

270
00:16:57.090 --> 00:17:01.609
what we can see is the Deferred Subscriber
Acquisition cost asset goes away.

271
00:17:01.609 --> 00:17:04.916
So at the end of 2014 at zero,
they've written it off,

272
00:17:04.916 --> 00:17:07.708
they've gotten rid of all
those deferred costs.

273
00:17:07.708 --> 00:17:11.632
If we look at the income statement,
we see the revenues are still growing.

274
00:17:11.632 --> 00:17:16.520
They have a $500 million net loss,
but that's because they wrote off that

275
00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:20.447
entire deferred subscriber
acquisition cost asset at once and

276
00:17:20.447 --> 00:17:24.096
it was $385 million when they
decided to write it off.

277
00:17:24.096 --> 00:17:28.986
So that's $385 million of future expenses
that they will no longer have to

278
00:17:28.986 --> 00:17:32.262
recognize, because they
put it all in this period.

279
00:17:32.262 --> 00:17:36.426
In on the cash flow statement, you could
see it's added back as a non-cash expense.

280
00:17:36.426 --> 00:17:40.876
There was a little bit of amortization and
Deferred Subscriber Acquisition cash cost

281
00:17:40.876 --> 00:17:45.710
reported, that's from the part of
the year before they change their policy.

282
00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:50.070
After they change their policy, you no
longer going to see these two line items,

283
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:54.840
because all the expense is gonna be
cash just be included in net income and

284
00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:56.160
cash from operations.

285
00:17:56.160 --> 00:18:00.489
And hey, notice cash from operations
has turned around and become positive.

286
00:18:00.489 --> 00:18:03.638
If we look at the ratios,
the ratios don't make any sense anymore,

287
00:18:03.638 --> 00:18:05.582
because they've changed their policy.

288
00:18:05.582 --> 00:18:07.934
Now we can't compare the ratios
across time anymore,

289
00:18:07.934 --> 00:18:10.750
because it's a different
accounting regime.

290
00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:14.790
But what we can see is if
they expensed immediately,

291
00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:19.440
they still would have had a drop in net
income, because they are still growing and

292
00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:22.600
they still have these huge costs
of sending out the DNA kit.

293
00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:28.410
Now for those of you that have been
googling Dog Nutrition Associates

294
00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:31.370
to sign up for their service,
this is a made up company, but

295
00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:35.160
it is based on a real company,
which I'm not gonna tell you who it is.

296
00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:37.870
But the only way the real company
got out of this mess was they,

297
00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:42.520
basically, used their inflated stock
price to make a big acquisition, get

298
00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:46.650
into a different business and then they
were able to carry on from this point.

299
00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:53.354
That wraps our look at capitalizing
versus expensing immediately.

300
00:18:53.354 --> 00:18:57.562
It's a very easy way that managers can
play with the timing of their expenses to

301
00:18:57.562 --> 00:19:01.980
smooth out their earnings, but it's also
a way that's a little bit easy to spot.

302
00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:05.384
What were gonna take a look at in
the next video are some expense

303
00:19:05.384 --> 00:19:08.070
manipulations that are more
difficult to find,

304
00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:13.360
because they involve reserve accounts
that are buried deep into the footnotes.

305
00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:15.432
I'll see you then.

306
00:19:15.432 --> 00:19:16.940
>> See you next video.
