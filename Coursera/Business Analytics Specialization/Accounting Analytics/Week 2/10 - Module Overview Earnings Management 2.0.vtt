00:00:04.591 --> 00:00:06.680
Hello.
I'm Professor Brian Bushee.

2
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.850
Welcome to week two of my part of
the accounting analytics course.

3
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.860
This week is going to represent a change
in mindset over what we did last week.

4
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.310
So last week we did ratios and

5
00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.570
forecasting to try to understand what
happened at a company during a year.

6
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.890
All along we were assuming that
the financial statements were a unbiased,

7
00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.710
accurate representation of the company's
performance and financial position.

8
00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.240
This week, we're going to change that
assumption because unfortunately,

9
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.690
there are a lot of companies,
probably more than you would suspect,

10
00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.140
that try to intentionally bias
their financial statements.

11
00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.740
In other words,
they make accounting choices or

12
00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.950
structured transactions in a way to try
to make their financial statements look

13
00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.980
better than they really should look.

14
00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.920
I'm going to call this phenomenon of
trying to bias the financial statements

15
00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.670
look better, earnings management.

16
00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.212
And what we're going to do this
week are look at some tools and

17
00:01:02.212 --> 00:01:05.477
techniques to try to spot
this earnings management.

18
00:01:05.477 --> 00:01:10.398
If we spot it, we don't want to just jump
in to the ratio analysis that we did last

19
00:01:10.398 --> 00:01:15.341
week, instead we want to try to undo some
of the bias that managers introduced.

20
00:01:15.341 --> 00:01:19.091
So we'll also talk about ways where
if we see financial statements where

21
00:01:19.091 --> 00:01:21.488
we think there has been
earnings management,

22
00:01:21.488 --> 00:01:25.421
how can we try to undo that earnings
management to get a more accurate picture

23
00:01:25.421 --> 00:01:28.330
of the company's performance
during the past period.

24
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.980
In the first video, we'll do
an overview of earnings management.

25
00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.730
We'll talk about means,
motive and opportunity.

26
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.293
So, motive, what are the manager's
incentives to manipulate their earnings or

27
00:01:39.293 --> 00:01:41.590
manipulate their financial statements.

28
00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.140
Means, how do they actually do it?

29
00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.110
How do they actually make
their earnings look better?

30
00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.940
And opportunity,
how do they get away with it?

31
00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.790
Then we'll move into two videos looking
at revenue recognition red flags.

32
00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.170
So, one of the most common ways managers
try to manipulate their earnings is by

33
00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:58.870
increasing their revenue.

34
00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.690
We'll first talk about revenue
recognition before cash is collected.

35
00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.610
We'll talk about something called
channel stuffing, where managers try to

36
00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.970
boost their revenue right at the end of
the period, but none of it involves cash.

37
00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.460
Then we'll talk about revenue
recognition after the sale,

38
00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.630
where we'll see something
called a cookie jar,

39
00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.070
unearned revenue account, where companies
can use this cookie jar account

40
00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.260
to smooth out their revenue when
their cash collections are volatile.

41
00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.145
Then we'll move to two videos
on expense recognition,

42
00:02:29.145 --> 00:02:33.410
because another way to manipulate your
earnings is to manage your expenses.

43
00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.600
First, we'll talk about
capitalization versus expensing.

44
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.190
This is a way that growth companies,

45
00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.110
especially young growth companies, can
try to make their earnings look better,

46
00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.450
by taking a lot of their cash costs,
and instead of having a big expense for

47
00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.930
them immediately, spread them out
over time through capitalization.

48
00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.980
And finally, we'll talk about reserve
accounts and delaying write-offs.

49
00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.740
Reserve accounts, like allowance for
doubtful accounts and

50
00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.640
warranty liability require assumptions.

51
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.590
So, managers can change those assumptions
to make their earnings look better.

52
00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:05.890
And write-offs.

53
00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.510
Sometimes managers should be
writing off their inventory or

54
00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.025
property plant equipment,
but by delaying those

55
00:03:11.025 --> 00:03:14.340
write-offs they can make their earnings
look better during the period.

56
00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.290
So it's going to be a small
number of videos this week but

57
00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.070
the videos are going to be fairly long,

58
00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.310
15 to 20 minutes, because I want to
try to introduce the tools.

59
00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.230
And do the cases within the same video.

60
00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.580
So make sure you block out plenty
of time to watch the videos,

61
00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.170
make sure you have enough to eat and
drink.

62
00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.039
Download all the spreadsheets and
extra material on the course platform and

63
00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:41.344
let's get out there and try to catch some
bad guys in financial reporting this week.
