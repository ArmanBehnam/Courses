00:00:03.147 --> 00:00:04.841
Hello, I'm professor Brian Bushee.

2
00:00:04.841 --> 00:00:05.990
Welcome back.

3
00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.170
In this video, we're gonna wrap up
our look at expense manipulations

4
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.640
by checking out reserve accounts and
write-downs.

5
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.160
To find these manipulations,

6
00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.980
we're gonna have to dive into
the footnotes to get the information.

7
00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.010
You're not gonna find this information
generally on the balance sheet or

8
00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:23.180
the income statement.

9
00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.220
But hey, it's fun to dive into
the footnotes, so let's get started.

10
00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.930
>> What is a footnote disclosure?

11
00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.510
Do we also have to look at headnotes and
handnotes?

12
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.150
>> No,
you do not have to look at headnotes or

13
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.490
handnotes, only the footnotes.

14
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.560
The footnotes are the part of
the annual report that come right after

15
00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:42.740
the financial statements.

16
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:43.909
Here, let me show you an example.

17
00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.210
So right after you've finished seeing
all of the finance statements,

18
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.810
the footnotes start.

19
00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.500
The footnotes provide all of the policies

20
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.090
that the company used to
do the accounting, and then

21
00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.100
all sorts of additional information that
doesn't fit on the financial statements.

22
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.690
A lot of this information is textual.

23
00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.000
It's paragraphs.

24
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.390
But then a lot of it is also tables and
additional numbers,

25
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.220
breaking down numbers that you can't
see on the financial statements.

26
00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.500
And as you can see, these notes go on and
on and on and on and on and on and

27
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.169
on and on and on.

28
00:01:16.398 --> 00:01:18.940
100 pages, 200 pages,

29
00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.930
an extensive amount of information
that follows the financial statements.

30
00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.740
This is the part of the report
that we're going to dig into

31
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.670
to find a lot of the information we need
for these types of expense manipulations.

32
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.490
The first type of expense manipulation
we'll look at involves reserve accounts.

33
00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.121
So companies have to make
assumptions each period for

34
00:01:39.121 --> 00:01:42.341
certain expenses that are associated
with revenue activities.

35
00:01:42.341 --> 00:01:45.757
For example, the rules require
that expected future losses due to

36
00:01:45.757 --> 00:01:49.424
customer defaults, so a customer
owes you money but doesn't pay you.

37
00:01:49.424 --> 00:01:53.102
And expected future losses due to
warranty claims, so you promise to fix

38
00:01:53.102 --> 00:01:56.609
a defective product and so you have
to pay cash in the future to fix it.

39
00:01:56.609 --> 00:02:00.900
Those both have to be recognized
at the time sales are made.

40
00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.530
And so we create expenses
called the provision for

41
00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.690
doubtful accounts and warranty expense.

42
00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.670
These expenses require reserve accounts
on the balance sheet to bridge

43
00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.510
the gap between when we recognize the
expense at the time sales are made, and

44
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.260
the future cash flows, or I guess,
in the case of doubtful accounts,

45
00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.360
the lack of future cash flows.

46
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.640
And so
we have on the asset side an allowance for

47
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.870
doubtful accounts, on the liability side,
a warranty liability.

48
00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.970
Companies can adjust the assumptions for

49
00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.800
these reserve accounts at the end of
the period to manipulate earnings.

50
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.050
So what we're going to look at is
the ratio of the allowance for

51
00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.930
doubtful accounts to gross
accounts receivable.

52
00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.970
That'll give us an estimate of the percent
of total receivables that will not be

53
00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.800
collected in the future.

54
00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.600
We'll also look at the ratio of
warranty expense to revenues,

55
00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.520
which gives us an estimate of
the percent of current sales

56
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.980
that will result in
future warranty claims.

57
00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.075
And if we see, for example,
a big drop in this estimated percentage of

58
00:02:56.075 --> 00:03:00.460
un-collectible receivables, it could
be indicative that the company has

59
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.740
slashed this percentage in order to
boost their earnings during the period.

60
00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.780
>> So, any drop in the uncollectible
percentage is manipulation?

61
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.849
Maybe the company just did a better job
with credit checks on its customers.

62
00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.840
>> No, you're right.

63
00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.980
A change in the percentage of
expected uncollectible accounts could

64
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.770
be due to legitimate
changes in the business.

65
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.450
If you see one of these big changes,
you wanna ask yourself,

66
00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.350
did the manager have strong incentives to
manipulate earnings this period or not.

67
00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:35.120
You also wanna look at the magnitude
of the estimated effect.

68
00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.950
So if change in this rate reduced the
expense by 300,000, but the company beat

69
00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.700
its earnings target by 5 million, then
it probably wasn't this change that was

70
00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.570
helping the earnings management, and they
may have done it for legitimate reasons.

71
00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:51.460
So identifying a big
change in this percentage

72
00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:55.410
is the start of your investigation,
it's not the end.

73
00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.580
It's not conclusive proof that
the company manipulated their earnings.

74
00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.495
The second type of expense manipulation
we're gonna look at is delaying

75
00:04:04.495 --> 00:04:05.740
write-downs.

76
00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.602
Companies are required to account for

77
00:04:07.602 --> 00:04:11.865
non-financial assets at something
called lower-of-cost-or-market, or LCM.

78
00:04:11.865 --> 00:04:15.410
Examples of non-financial assets
would be inventory, property,

79
00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.660
plant, equipment, intangible assets.

80
00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.950
Basically any asset that's not denominated
in a dollar amount or a currency amount.

81
00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.170
If the current fair value of the asset is
greater than its book value, and by book

82
00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:32.380
value, I mean the value on the financial
statements, you don't do anything.

83
00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.180
And I use the term fair value,

84
00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.530
what that means is it's the market
value of the asset today.

85
00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:42.100
In other words, how much it would cost
to buy the asset in the market or

86
00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.630
it's an estimate of market
value if there is no market.

87
00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.500
And that's why we've changed to calling it
fair value instead of market value because

88
00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:54.708
we need to come up with a value even if
there's no traded market for the asset.

89
00:04:54.708 --> 00:04:56.350
But we still call it lower of cost or
market for

90
00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:59.360
some reason,
it should be lower of cost or fair value.

91
00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.380
Anyway, if the current fair value
of the asset is below book value,

92
00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.280
below the value on the finance statements,

93
00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.410
then you have to write down the book
value to the current fair value.

94
00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:13.650
This decision rule is based on a fair
value using undiscounted cash flows, but

95
00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.120
the write down is based
on discounted cash flows.

96
00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.560
>> I don't even know what question to ask.

97
00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.730
>> Then I guess I don't know
what question to answer.

98
00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:28.310
Yeah, I understand that this
is really technical, and

99
00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:33.300
I could spend an entire video just
diving into these impairment rules,

100
00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.260
these rules on when you write down assets.

101
00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:37.640
But the only point I wanna make for

102
00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.590
now is that there's a lot of
discretion in these rules.

103
00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:45.290
And so that even if a manager thought that
an asset was impaired, that its value had

104
00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:50.990
dropped below its fair value, it can still
find ways to delay that write down for

105
00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:55.820
a quarter or two in order to
protect its earnings this period.

106
00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:02.500
So companies could delay these
write-downs by using their judgement and

107
00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:07.510
estimates to say that the current fair
value has not dropped below book value and

108
00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:12.250
thus manipulate their earnings by avoiding
recognizing the write-down expense.

109
00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:16.620
So we'll try to spot this by looking at
days inventory or days finished goods.

110
00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:18.620
If that starts to increase dramatically,

111
00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.110
it could be the company
is avoiding a write-down.

112
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.650
We'll also look at the ratio of revenue
to whatever non-financial asset we're

113
00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:28.550
interested in, be it Property Plant
Equipment, Goodwill or Intangible Assets.

114
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:34.110
So let's practice applying
these red flags with a case.

115
00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:37.690
So we're going to look at
the case of Dogamer Enterprises.

116
00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:42.110
Dogamer develops and
manufactures video games for dogs.

117
00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:42.850
As you know,

118
00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:46.800
dogs cannot play traditional video games
due to their lack of opposable thumbs.

119
00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.230
So they can't hold the controllers.

120
00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:52.990
Dogamer developed a gaming
unit with eye scan technology

121
00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:57.150
that lets dogs play by moving their
eyes to different parts of the screen.

122
00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:00.580
And that's how they can control
the action in the video game.

123
00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:05.090
The company went IPO in 2003 and
grew rapidly.

124
00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:09.400
Then in 2012, the American Veterinary
Medical Association issued

125
00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:13.220
research on the dangers of screen time for
dogs, and

126
00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:18.420
they recommended no more than two hours
of screen time per week for dogs.

127
00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:22.562
Well, sales of Dogamer products started
to suffer as a result of this warning.

128
00:07:22.562 --> 00:07:30.035
The company posted a net loss of 145
million in 2013 and 89 million in 2014.

129
00:07:30.035 --> 00:07:36.680
They needed an emergency bridge loan of
$30 million in early 2015 to stay afloat.

130
00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:42.293
And the auditor gave the company
a going concern opinion in 2014.

131
00:07:42.293 --> 00:07:46.060
>> What is a going concern opinion?

132
00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:50.667
>> A going concern opinion is a situation
where the auditor gives an opinion to

133
00:07:50.667 --> 00:07:54.625
indicate that the company may go
bankrupt within the next year.

134
00:07:54.625 --> 00:07:58.673
The auditor has to do that because the
financial statements includes all of these

135
00:07:58.673 --> 00:08:02.257
long term estimates, like you
depreciate a building over 25 years.

136
00:08:02.257 --> 00:08:05.099
Or you may spread unearned
revenue over three years.

137
00:08:05.099 --> 00:08:08.196
But if you thought the company was
gonna go bankrupt within a year.

138
00:08:08.196 --> 00:08:09.870
Then those finance statements are wrong.

139
00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:12.787
You should actually have
things at liquidation value.

140
00:08:12.787 --> 00:08:15.702
So the going concern opinion
is the auditor's way to say.

141
00:08:15.702 --> 00:08:20.011
You can trust these statements if you
think the companies can continue as

142
00:08:20.011 --> 00:08:22.930
a functioning, healthy going concern.

143
00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:26.355
But we have reservations that
the company's able to do that.

144
00:08:26.355 --> 00:08:29.530
And so you have to treat these
statements with caution.

145
00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:33.507
Because you may wanna think about looking
at it as a bankruptcy within the next

146
00:08:33.507 --> 00:08:34.128
year or so.

147
00:08:35.556 --> 00:08:38.825
So in the midst of this
crisis in their business,

148
00:08:38.825 --> 00:08:43.460
Dogamer implemented
a turn-around plan late in 2014.

149
00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:45.020
They changed their top management.

150
00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:47.630
They brought in some people that
were experienced in turning

151
00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:49.740
around distressed companies.

152
00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:51.650
They did a lot of cost-cutting actions.

153
00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:56.590
Things like employee layoffs, closing
facilities, delaying capital expenditures.

154
00:08:56.590 --> 00:09:00.430
They also signed a strategic
alliance with Shibatendo of Japan

155
00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:02.600
to try to boost sales in Asia.

156
00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:08.570
Shibatendo was a traditional,
non-electronic dog toy gaming company,

157
00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:11.850
which would now carry
dogamers electronic games.

158
00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:15.200
And the good news was that in Asia
they were not as familiar with

159
00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:16.760
this screen time research.

160
00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:20.270
The strategy was a great success.

161
00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:24.110
Sales turned around and
were up 4% in 2015.

162
00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:26.930
The company had net
income of $13 million and

163
00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:30.340
the auditor removed
the going concern opinion.

164
00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:33.050
So now the future looks bright for
Dogamer.

165
00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:37.010
Based on the turnaround, the company was
able to sign deals to be the exclusive

166
00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:41.630
provider of dog gaming products in
the Big W retail chain in Australia, and

167
00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:44.470
the warehouse retail chain in New Zealand.

168
00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:48.550
And they also signed a contract with the
government of Switzerland to develop and

169
00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:51.860
sell to them St.
Bernard training simulation games.

170
00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:54.330
So things have really turned
around at the company.

171
00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:58.500
So now let's bring up this spreadsheet.

172
00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:02.150
Where I've got all of doggamers
financial statements.

173
00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:03.150
So I took their 2015 and

174
00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:08.030
2014 results, which were reported in
their most recent finance statements.

175
00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:13.280
And then I added in columns for 2013 and
2012 from prior financial statements.

176
00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:16.950
What we can see is their
total assets trending down.

177
00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:21.260
In the way the years are,
you have to read right to left here.

178
00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.347
So, as the crisis is going on,
they're getting smaller,

179
00:10:24.347 --> 00:10:26.705
but then their size stabilizes in 2015.

180
00:10:26.705 --> 00:10:32.613
We can see their sales drop
dramatically between 2013 and 2014.

181
00:10:32.613 --> 00:10:35.423
And then we see the 4% increase into 2015.

182
00:10:35.423 --> 00:10:38.179
The two net losses in 2013 and

183
00:10:38.179 --> 00:10:43.108
2014 turns into a net profit,
net income in 2015.

184
00:10:43.108 --> 00:10:48.529
And their cash from operations
rebounded and became positive in 2015.

185
00:10:48.529 --> 00:10:53.503
The first item I want to focus on to
look for potential expense manipulation,

186
00:10:53.503 --> 00:10:56.608
is this accounts receivable net.

187
00:10:56.608 --> 00:10:59.330
Now, what doggamer does is
they give us the allowance for

188
00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:01.780
outflow accounts right
here in the balance sheet.

189
00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:03.346
Some companies don't do that.

190
00:11:03.346 --> 00:11:05.270
In which case,
you'd have to look in a footnote.

191
00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:08.720
But since it's on the balance sheet we
can go ahead and use these numbers.

192
00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:11.720
So go over to the accounts
receivable allowance tab.

193
00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:14.560
I've repeated the line
from the balance sheet.

194
00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:17.060
The calculation we're going to
do is we're going to start with

195
00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:21.440
net accounts receivable, add the allowance
for uncollectibles, or allowance for

196
00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:24.680
doubtful accounts to get something
called gross accounts receivable.

197
00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:31.020
Gross accounts receivable is the total
amount that customers owe us.

198
00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:35.830
The allowance is the amount of that
total we expect to not collect.

199
00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:39.700
So net accounts receivable is the amount
that we expect to collect from customers.

200
00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:42.050
So that's the number that
goes on the balance sheet.

201
00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:46.940
But what we're interested in is the ratio
of how much we expect to not collect,

202
00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:47.990
the allowance.

203
00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:50.335
Divided by the total that's owed us.

204
00:11:50.335 --> 00:11:55.455
And we can see if we do that ratio
in 2012, we come up with 3%.

205
00:11:55.455 --> 00:11:59.570
So 3% of our gross accounts receivable
we expect to never collect.

206
00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:05.800
That percent stays steady
around 3% through 2012, 2013,

207
00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:10.930
2014 and then plummets to 1.7% in 2015.

208
00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:17.220
So in 2015, DogGamers is expecting
to collect a lot more of their

209
00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:21.239
receivables because their allowance is
a midge smaller percentage of their gross.

210
00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:26.910
What we can do is actually quantify how
much this would have helped their net

211
00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:28.521
income during the period.

212
00:12:28.521 --> 00:12:33.501
So what we can do is say what if we took
their gross accounts receivable at the end

213
00:12:33.501 --> 00:12:34.417
of 2015.

214
00:12:34.417 --> 00:12:37.810
And multiply it by the rate
they used in 2014.

215
00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:43.080
We would come up with
an allowance of $4,210.

216
00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:48.360
So in other words, if they had carried
that 3.15% over as the percentage in 2015,

217
00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:51.410
their allowance would have 4,210.

218
00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:54.226
The actual allowance was 2,272,

219
00:12:54.226 --> 00:12:58.841
which means that their allowance
was almost two million lower.

220
00:12:58.841 --> 00:13:00.986
Due to the drop in percentage,

221
00:13:00.986 --> 00:13:05.121
which means that their expense
was also two million lower.

222
00:13:05.121 --> 00:13:10.704
So it saved them two million in
expense by reducing this percentage.

223
00:13:10.704 --> 00:13:13.258
Next I wanna take a look
at warranty expense.

224
00:13:13.258 --> 00:13:16.605
So if we go back to the balance sheet and
look at liabilities.

225
00:13:16.605 --> 00:13:19.610
There's no liabilities listed for
warranty liabilities.

226
00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:22.951
That's because they're included as
part of these accrued liabilities.

227
00:13:22.951 --> 00:13:25.830
So we're gonna have to look at
the footnote to get the information.

228
00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:27.490
So let me bring up their footnote.

229
00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:28.848
So you can see what it looks like.

230
00:13:28.848 --> 00:13:34.606
As you can see, it gives you
a description of what the warranties are.

231
00:13:34.606 --> 00:13:38.426
Then it gives you the balance
at the beginning of the year.

232
00:13:38.426 --> 00:13:41.490
The provisions are the new
warranty expense.

233
00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:46.605
So those are the estimates of how
much of current sales will result

234
00:13:46.605 --> 00:13:51.637
in warranty claims so
it adds to the liability, utilizations.

235
00:13:51.637 --> 00:13:55.340
That's the cash paid for
fixing warranty claims.

236
00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:56.873
So that reduces the liability.

237
00:13:56.873 --> 00:13:59.554
Then we get the balance at December 31.

238
00:13:59.554 --> 00:14:03.792
So now let me go back to the spreadsheet.

239
00:14:03.792 --> 00:14:06.171
So you can see I brought
in that information here.

240
00:14:06.171 --> 00:14:10.072
I also added another year from
a prior financial statement, 2013.

241
00:14:10.072 --> 00:14:11.190
So we can look at a trend.

242
00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:15.050
I also brought in net sales since
we're going to use this to come up

243
00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:17.349
with a percent of warranty expense.

244
00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:20.340
So that line shows up here.

245
00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:23.430
We're gonna take warranty
expense as a percent of sales.

246
00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:27.820
So we've got the provision or
expense divided by net sales.

247
00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:29.672
We find that in 2013,

248
00:14:29.672 --> 00:14:34.988
DogGamer had 1% of their sales that
they estimated as warranty expense.

249
00:14:34.988 --> 00:14:39.112
That percent stayed around 1% in 2014 and

250
00:14:39.112 --> 00:14:42.731
then plummeted to .73% in 2015.

251
00:14:42.731 --> 00:14:48.400
We can also look at the warranty claims,
the cash claims as a percent of sales.

252
00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:52.550
And we can see that that
rate has been steady and

253
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:55.820
actually increasing
a little bit over time.

254
00:14:55.820 --> 00:15:00.780
So this drop in warranty expense to
sales does not seem to be justified by

255
00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:03.190
fewer warranty claims.

256
00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:05.177
Which makes it a potential manipulation.

257
00:15:05.177 --> 00:15:07.813
So we can do the same
calculation we did before.

258
00:15:07.813 --> 00:15:15.383
Where we take net sales in 2015, times the
warranty expense to sales ratio in 2014.

259
00:15:15.383 --> 00:15:20.199
To come up with what the expense
in 2015 would have been

260
00:15:20.199 --> 00:15:24.542
had they not dropped
the rate from 1% to 0.7%.

261
00:15:24.542 --> 00:15:27.688
So their expense would have been $54.63.

262
00:15:27.688 --> 00:15:31.868
We can compare that to their
actual expense in 2015.

263
00:15:31.868 --> 00:15:36.227
And see that they saved
two million of expenses by

264
00:15:36.227 --> 00:15:40.064
reducing this warranty rate in 2015.

265
00:15:40.064 --> 00:15:45.255
Now I want to go back to the balance
sheet and take a look at inventories

266
00:15:45.255 --> 00:15:49.746
to see if I can find some
evidence of delayed write-downs.

267
00:15:49.746 --> 00:15:52.520
So I've got an inventory tab.

268
00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:54.326
Bring in inventories
from the balance sheet.

269
00:15:54.326 --> 00:15:57.373
Cost of sales,
I can get days inventory ratio.

270
00:15:57.373 --> 00:16:02.676
And I see that there's not much
going on between 2014 and 2015.

271
00:16:02.676 --> 00:16:07.810
However, there is a footnote that
provides more information on inventory.

272
00:16:07.810 --> 00:16:09.830
And let me bring up that footnote now.

273
00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:13.640
So if you look at the footnote,

274
00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:17.860
you can see it breaks down
inventory into raw materials.

275
00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:21.350
Those are all of the supplies and
components and

276
00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:25.260
basic parts that the company
will use to make gaming systems.

277
00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:26.880
Work in process,

278
00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:31.160
which is the cost of the gaming systems
that are in the process of being built.

279
00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:35.150
And finished goods which is the cost
of gaming systems that are complete and

280
00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:37.810
just sitting in a warehouse
waiting to be sold.

281
00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:40.060
So now let's go back to the spreadsheet.

282
00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:43.740
As you can see,
I brought in that information.

283
00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:47.990
I brought in also the prior two
years from another footnote.

284
00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:51.310
Now we can calculate Days Raw Materials,
Days Work in Progress,

285
00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:56.000
Days Finished Goods, which is just
the average inventory level for

286
00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.870
each component compared to cost
of sales or cost of goods sold.

287
00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:06.830
So we see for Days Raw Material, there was
a big drop in the number of days in 2015.

288
00:17:06.830 --> 00:17:11.963
Also, for Days Work in Process, there's
a big downward trend with a drop in 2015.

289
00:17:11.963 --> 00:17:15.880
That indicates that the company
is scaling back production.

290
00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:19.220
They're holding less raw
materials in the warehouse, and

291
00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:22.250
they're not building as
many gaming systems.

292
00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:25.740
If we look at Days Finished Goods,
it was holding steady at 57,

293
00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:30.580
then it jumped to almost 65 days in 2015.

294
00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:33.450
That means that the finished
gaming systems are staying in

295
00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:36.830
the warehouse longer
before they're being sold.

296
00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:39.430
This could be the delayed write downs,

297
00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:41.730
where these are gaming systems
that have become obsolete.

298
00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:43.830
They can't sell them,
they should write them down, but

299
00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:46.380
instead they're just holding them longer.

300
00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:50.010
Again, we can estimate how much
they may have benefited from this.

301
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:54.880
So what we need to do is figure out
what would finished goods have been

302
00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:58.130
had they maintained their
Days Finished Goods at 57.

303
00:17:58.130 --> 00:18:02.570
This is complicated because there's
an average balance of inventory.

304
00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:06.380
So the calculations get a little tricky.

305
00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:11.370
First we have to figure out the Average
Finished Goods at the 2014 days level.

306
00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:14.810
So what we do is we take the days of 57,

307
00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:19.770
divide by 365,
take it times cost of sales for 2015.

308
00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:22.020
That's what Average Finished Goods
should have been.

309
00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:26.380
Then what we can do is figure out
what finished goods at the end

310
00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:28.270
of 2015 should be based on that average.

311
00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:33.882
So basically it's what number
average between 39,109 and

312
00:18:33.882 --> 00:18:39.307
39,120 gives you finished goods,
and it's 39,130, so that's

313
00:18:39.307 --> 00:18:45.800
what their finished goods should've been,
if Days Finished Goods stayed the same.

314
00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:50.303
Instead, it was 49,355, and
what that means is they

315
00:18:50.303 --> 00:18:55.708
potentially saved $10 million in
expenses by not writing down their

316
00:18:55.708 --> 00:19:00.860
finished goods that are potentially
obsolete and are not selling.

317
00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:07.400
The last place I'd wanna look for delayed
write downs would be in property plant

318
00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:11.160
equipment, capitalized product costs,
and goodwill.

319
00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:14.660
I didn't find anything, but I did find
something interesting in digging through

320
00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:17.010
some of the ratios we saw last video.

321
00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:21.000
I'm not gonna go through these
calculations now in the interest of time.

322
00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.680
You can look at them on your own later,
but the years amortization for

323
00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:29.110
the capitalized product cost
shot way up in 2015, so

324
00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:31.780
they're amortizing over more years.

325
00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:34.600
And for property plant equipment,
the years of amortization or

326
00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:36.920
depreciation also shot up in 2015.

327
00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:39.650
And so

328
00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:43.440
I decided to go to the footnote to see
if I could find an explanation for this.

329
00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:48.310
Here is the capitalized
product cost footnote.

330
00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:52.470
Again, in the interest of time I'm not
gonna read it to you, but It's available

331
00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:56.300
on the course platform if you wanna
download it and read it at your leisure.

332
00:19:56.300 --> 00:20:01.320
The key part of this footnote is the last
sentence, where they say that in 2015,

333
00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:05.110
the company determined it was appropriate
to extend the amortization period for

334
00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:09.578
content cost, resulting in a decrease
in cost of sales of $3.8 million.

335
00:20:09.578 --> 00:20:15.058
So that's $3.8 million expense they saved
by increasing the amortization period.

336
00:20:15.058 --> 00:20:20.150
Here's the PP&E footnote, same thing,
you can look at it on your own.

337
00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:22.490
The key sentence is the last sentence.

338
00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:26.760
During 2015, the company completed an
assessment of its capital investment plans

339
00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:30.170
and determined the useful life of its
computers should be extended by two years,

340
00:20:30.170 --> 00:20:35.150
resulting in a decrease in selling general
administrative expense of $3.6 million.

341
00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:41.380
So more expense that's saved by
increasing the amortization lives.

342
00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:45.410
The last tab of the spreadsheet summarizes
everything that we've looked at.

343
00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:49.660
So you can see in this first row,
the two losses in 2013 and 2014, and

344
00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:52.510
then they have a profit in 2015.

345
00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:57.320
But then if we pull out the benefits
due to the reduction in

346
00:20:57.320 --> 00:21:00.543
the AR allowance ratio,
the reduction in the warranty rate,

347
00:21:00.543 --> 00:21:05.780
the delayed inventory write-off,
they would have actually had a loss.

348
00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:09.230
Then if we pull out the benefits due
to increasing the useful lives of

349
00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:14.830
the capitalized costs in the computers,
they would have had a even bigger loss.

350
00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:18.690
Now it's not as big of a loss as
they had the prior two years, but

351
00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:20.340
it's still a loss.

352
00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:27.190
And so by these five changes, Dogamer
was able to turn a third consecutive

353
00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:32.200
year of losses into a nice turnaround
where they were profitable in 2015,

354
00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:39.280
showing that their turnaround strategy
is really [COUGH] [COUGH] working.

355
00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:43.220
>> Honey, can y’all tell me
whether this is good or bad?

356
00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:46.610
Seems bad because they
manipulated their earnings.

357
00:21:46.610 --> 00:21:49.110
However, they saved the business.

358
00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:53.610
>> Yes, they even tricked some new
customers into doing business with them!

359
00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:59.680
>> This is a good example of why I
teach accounting and not ethics.

360
00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:02.970
So it's tricky to decide
whether this is good or bad.

361
00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:06.800
I mean at some level it is bad
that the managers are trying

362
00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:11.180
to mislead outsiders to think
the company is healthier than it is.

363
00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:15.145
On the other hand, by doing so, they're
saving the company, they're saving their

364
00:22:15.145 --> 00:22:19.290
employees' jobs, they're saving all
the investment of their investors.

365
00:22:19.290 --> 00:22:22.000
And certainly for
those people, this is good.

366
00:22:23.170 --> 00:22:27.140
So I'm not gonna get in to good or
bad, because it's very, very tricky.

367
00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:31.770
Instead, I wanna give you the tools
to spot potential manipulations.

368
00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:34.730
And then you can use your
own moral compass to decide

369
00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:37.390
whether the manipulations were good or
bad.

370
00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:42.460
That wraps up our week-long
look at revenue and

371
00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:47.120
expense manipulations in order to
try to manipulate your net income.

372
00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:51.310
As I've mentioned, these revenue and
expense manipulations are the most common

373
00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:56.250
reason that companies get in trouble with
the SEC, cuz there's a lot of discretion

374
00:22:56.250 --> 00:23:00.730
in when you can recognize revenue and
when you can recognize the expense.

375
00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:05.030
So if you're looking at a company, you
have some suspicions about the earnings

376
00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:09.120
management incentives,
these are good red flags to check out

377
00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:13.350
as a first pass in whether there
might be some manipulation going on.

378
00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:16.470
Hope you enjoyed the week, and
I look forward to seeing you again soon.

379
00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:19.080
