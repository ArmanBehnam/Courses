00:00:03.699 --> 00:00:05.190
Hello I'm Professor Brian Bushee.

2
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:06.360
Welcome back.

3
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:06.880
In this video,

4
00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.230
we're gonna take a look at something
called the Discretionary Accruals Model.

5
00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:16.240
The idea of this model is to pick up
earnings management when managers

6
00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.230
are making tweaks to a bunch of different
accounts instead of changing one account.

7
00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.762
So for example, manager tweaks
the estimate of an expense to reduce it,

8
00:00:25.762 --> 00:00:30.371
recognizes a little bit of extra revenue,
capitalizes some extra cost,

9
00:00:30.371 --> 00:00:31.805
reduce that expense.

10
00:00:31.805 --> 00:00:35.099
If we looked at the tools for
each of those individual accounts,

11
00:00:35.099 --> 00:00:37.482
the changes might not be
big enough to pick up.

12
00:00:37.482 --> 00:00:41.250
But together, they had a significant
impact on the accruals or

13
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.400
noncash portion of earnings, and
we can pick that up using this model.

14
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.480
The basic idea of the model is we're
gonna use a regression analysis

15
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.935
to try to figure out what
the level of accruals or

16
00:00:52.935 --> 00:00:58.280
noncash earnings would be if the manager
was not committing any manipulations.

17
00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.210
Then any differences
from that expected level

18
00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.310
are potentially evidence
of earnings management.

19
00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:05.410
It's a really cool model.

20
00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:06.279
Let's get started.

21
00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.630
Before we talk about discretionary
accruals models first let's take a step

22
00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.180
back and review what we mean by accruals.

23
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.696
So you can think of a company's earnings,
or

24
00:01:17.696 --> 00:01:21.920
its net income as made up of cash
earning and non-cash earnings.

25
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.112
Cash flow from operations is a measure
of the cash earnings during the period.

26
00:01:27.112 --> 00:01:29.352
The non-cash earnings
are all the accruals,

27
00:01:29.352 --> 00:01:34.320
all of the earnings that are recognized
at a point different than the cash flow.

28
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.610
So things like sales made on account.

29
00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.940
When you deliver the goods and
recognize revenue but

30
00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.900
haven't collected the cash yet.

31
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.760
Depreciation expense, where you spent
the cash a long time ago on a building.

32
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.860
And now you're showing the expense
through depreciation this period.

33
00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.760
Warranty expense, which is an example of
an expense that's recognized before you

34
00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.707
actually pay the cash to
fix the defective goods.

35
00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.220
So in general, these accruals improve
the measurement of firm performance by

36
00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.530
tying the earnings to business activities,
rather than to cash flows.

37
00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.600
And that's why we've
been using this model for

38
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.995
over 500 years because the accruals
are informative about from performance and

39
00:02:12.995 --> 00:02:15.290
they're also very informative
about future performance.

40
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.000
But the problem is that accruals
are also the easiest portion of earnings

41
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.290
to manipulate, because they're based
on managerial judgment and estimates.

42
00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.340
And we saw this a little bit
last week with the revenue and

43
00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.190
expense manipulations.

44
00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.650
We talked about some ratios that
could detect those manipulations.

45
00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.300
But those ratios are only gonna work for
bigger manipulations of revenues and

46
00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.570
expenses, which also may be the easier
ones for outsiders to detect.

47
00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.690
So what would happen if managers
made small manipulations

48
00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.080
to a number of accounts?

49
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.260
Well, the discretionary
accruals models are designed to

50
00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.731
detect this very type of manipulation.

51
00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.649
>> Nice explanation, except that I have
no idea what you are talking about.

52
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.630
>> It's good to see that
we're off to a great start.

53
00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.878
I'm gonna give you a example
of this later in the video.

54
00:03:09.878 --> 00:03:14.858
So when we're going through and estimating
these models we'll go in in one case and

55
00:03:14.858 --> 00:03:17.575
manipulate a little bit
of bad debt expense.

56
00:03:17.575 --> 00:03:21.471
We'll delay a write-off,
we'll tweak the warranty expense, and

57
00:03:21.471 --> 00:03:23.900
individually they won't be big changes.

58
00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.149
But collectively,
they'll have a big impact on earnings and

59
00:03:27.149 --> 00:03:30.660
one that we can pick up with these
discretionary accruals models.

60
00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.590
The model that we're gonna use for

61
00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.890
discretionary accruals is called
the Modified Jones Model.

62
00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.370
It was first developed by Jennifer Jones

63
00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.606
as part of her doctoral education at the
University of Michigan in the early 1990s,

64
00:03:43.606 --> 00:03:47.385
and then it was modified
by subsequent research.

65
00:03:47.385 --> 00:03:50.660
It starts with the premise that
the accrual portion of earning should be

66
00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.390
a function of revenue growth and
tangible assets.

67
00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.410
Revenue growth because growing sales
causes working capital to grow.

68
00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:04.350
So things like receivables and payables
which should increase non-cash earnings.

69
00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.430
And property plan equipment because higher
property plan equipment is going to lead

70
00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.490
to higher depreciation charges and
non-cash earnings.

71
00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:16.807
So the model is accruals should be
a function of the cash revenue growth and

72
00:04:16.807 --> 00:04:19.830
property plant and equipment.

73
00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:23.710
We're going to define accruals as net
income minus cash from operations, so

74
00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.509
that non-cash portion of net income.

75
00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.470
We're gonna define cash revenue growth as

76
00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.980
the change in revenue minus
the change in accounts receivable.

77
00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:38.880
So, this tries to get at how much of
the growth and revenue was in cash sales.

78
00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.500
And we look at cash sales because,

79
00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.450
of course, revenue on its own could be
one of the things that's manipulated.

80
00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:47.480
And so, to be able to pick
up revenue manipulations,

81
00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.810
we need to look at cash revenue
growth to explain accruals.

82
00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:53.830
And then the final component is property,
plant, and

83
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.940
equipment which we measure as gross
property, plant, and equipment.

84
00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.568
So in other words, PP&E before you
subtract out the depreciation.

85
00:05:02.843 --> 00:05:04.520
>> More Greek letters!

86
00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.400
Is this an accounting class or
a classics class?

87
00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.709
Are you also going to ask us to
read the Iliad and the Odyssey?

88
00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:15.630
>> Well I actually haven't read
the Iliad and the Odyssey myself so

89
00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:17.780
I'm not gonna ask you to read it.

90
00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.920
Sorry for the Greek letters.

91
00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:23.850
The convention with regression
models is that for the theoretical

92
00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:27.960
regression model you include Greek letters
for the intercept, the coefficients.

93
00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.910
You include an epsilon as
an error term to recognize that

94
00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:33.610
no model is gonna be perfect,
there will always be error.

95
00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:38.020
Then when you estimate the model using
data, you go away from the Greek letters.

96
00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.450
I should note at this point that if
you've never seen regression before,

97
00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:43.170
you should be okay.

98
00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:46.930
Cuz I'm gonna present the material in
a way, and give you resources so that you

99
00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:51.480
actually don't have to understand how
the regression works to be able to use it.

100
00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.670
Think of it as some kind of magical
statistical technique which

101
00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:58.840
allows us to model what a company's
results should look like

102
00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.470
if the manager's doing no manipulation.

103
00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:04.915
Then we can look for
differences from that ideal level and

104
00:06:04.915 --> 00:06:07.550
those differences could
reflect earnings management.

105
00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:13.910
So anyway, accruals that fit this
model are gonna be normal accruals.

106
00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:18.130
These are accruals that are explained
by normal business activities.

107
00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:23.160
In other words, if there was no
manipulation activity at all by managers,

108
00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.510
this is the amount of accruals
we would expect to see.

109
00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:30.720
Accruals that don't fit this model
are called discretionary accruals and

110
00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:34.210
these are the ones that are more
likely to reflect earnings management.

111
00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:35.920
But there's some caveats.

112
00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.812
So changes in the business,
so acquisitions,

113
00:06:38.812 --> 00:06:42.573
divestitures, changes in segments,
changes in strategy,

114
00:06:42.573 --> 00:06:47.519
changes in the industry like technological
innovation, or just bad model fit.

115
00:06:47.519 --> 00:06:49.477
The model doesn't fit very well for

116
00:06:49.477 --> 00:06:53.792
a given company could also create
the appearance of discretionary accruals.

117
00:06:53.792 --> 00:06:57.825
So we're gonna have to exercise
some caution and do some additional

118
00:06:57.825 --> 00:07:02.709
benchmarking and think about earnings
management incentives before we can judge

119
00:07:02.709 --> 00:07:07.610
that a discretionary accruals number is
likely to reflect earnings management.

120
00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:14.220
>> So you are saying that this model
works quite well except, of course,

121
00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:16.180
for all of the times it doesn't work.

122
00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:20.230
>> Yeah,
that is pretty much what I'm saying.

123
00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:25.930
So we've talked about this in a lot of the
videos that none of these tools provide

124
00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:30.760
definitive evidence that a management team
is 100% committing earnings management.

125
00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.910
Instead it's just suggestive that
something unusual is going on in

126
00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:36.430
the numbers this year.

127
00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:38.410
Then we have to look for

128
00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:41.640
are their earnings management
motives that the manager has?

129
00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:45.270
Are the changes for
the firm unusual given the industry?

130
00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:49.210
So do we see similar discretionary
accruals for competitors or not?

131
00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:52.890
And then, are there any changes in
the business which may either explain why

132
00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:55.841
the discretionary accruals
are really not discretionary?

133
00:07:55.841 --> 00:07:57.748
They're part of the normal business, or

134
00:07:57.748 --> 00:08:01.640
changes in policy which would help
them facilitate manipulation.

135
00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:02.320
So in other words,

136
00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:06.470
these discretionary accrual models are not
the end of your investigation into whether

137
00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:10.060
companies committing earnings management,
they're the start of your investigation.

138
00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:16.060
Here's the approach we're gonna use
to estimate discretionary accruals.

139
00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:19.250
So we've got our model for
explaining accruals as a function of

140
00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:21.950
cash revenue growth and
property plant & equipment.

141
00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:25.460
We're gonna scale all these variables by
prior total assets which means that we're

142
00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:28.170
gonna divide them all
by prior total assets.

143
00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:30.620
This is gonna remove a firm size effect.

144
00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:35.040
If we don't do this,
then our model's gonna be messed up for

145
00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:39.480
smaller firms because the larger firms
are gonna dominate how it gets estimated.

146
00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:45.960
Once we do that then we can estimate
a regression to get parameters a, b and c.

147
00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:49.416
So we replace the theoretical
intercept alpha with

148
00:08:49.416 --> 00:08:53.122
the intercept a that we
estimated in a certain sample.

149
00:08:53.122 --> 00:08:57.439
Same thing with the coefficients beta and
chi, we'll replace them with b and c,

150
00:08:57.439 --> 00:09:00.550
which we estimate within a certain sample.

151
00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:03.470
There's two approaches we're
gonna use to form samples.

152
00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:07.960
One is time series, so we're gonna
use the past history for the company.

153
00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:11.680
So, if we want to measure discretionary
accruals this year, we'll take say,

154
00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:16.950
the prior ten years of data and use
those ten years to estimate a, b, and c.

155
00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:21.010
The disadvantage of this
approach is you can't do it for

156
00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:23.920
younger firms cuz you need at
least ten years of prior data.

157
00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:28.814
Also you can have some bad model fit
if the parameters change over time.

158
00:09:28.814 --> 00:09:31.636
So if the company makes big
acquisitions during this period,

159
00:09:31.636 --> 00:09:35.820
the parameters won't necessarily
carry over to the current period.

160
00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:38.660
So the other approach we'll
use is cross-sectional,

161
00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:43.750
where we'll look at everyone in a firm's
industry at the same point in time.

162
00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:46.460
So this will allow us to
look at younger firms.

163
00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:49.830
It'll guard against the parameters
changing over time cuz we're

164
00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:54.000
estimating the parameters
based on the same period.

165
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.110
The disadvantage of this approach is it's
sensitive to the definition of industry.

166
00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:02.190
If you include too many firms in
the definition of industry that

167
00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:06.280
are different from the firm you're looking
at, again you could get bad model fit.

168
00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:09.390
So there's pros and cons to each,
we'll do them both ways initially.

169
00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:14.370
The other thing to think about is we
have to assume there's no manipulation

170
00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:16.860
on average in the estimation sample.

171
00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:21.610
So ideally we would estimate a, b,
and c in a sample where there's no

172
00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:26.580
manipulation going on which would allow us
to detect manipulation out of that sample.

173
00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:31.361
But if there is manipulation in
the estimation sample it's just gonna

174
00:10:31.361 --> 00:10:34.125
reduce our power to find manipulation.

175
00:10:34.125 --> 00:10:38.185
Once we get a, b and c, then we
are going to calculate normal accruals

176
00:10:38.185 --> 00:10:41.895
as the intercept a + the coefficient
b * cash revenue growth +

177
00:10:41.895 --> 00:10:45.615
the coefficient c *
properly plan equipment.

178
00:10:45.615 --> 00:10:51.369
And then discretionary accruals are simply
accruals- our estimate of normal accruals.

179
00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:56.090
>> Dude,
I am ready to run some regressions.

180
00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:59.220
>> Dude, that's awesome.

181
00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:03.620
Go find the Arfabark company
spreadsheet on the course platform, and

182
00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:05.780
let's go run some gnarly regressions.

183
00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:12.500
The example we're gonna use to show how to
do these models is Arfabark corp foration.

184
00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:18.290
And we're interested in doing
discretion accruals for 2009 and 2010.

185
00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:20.380
First I'm gonna do a time series approach,

186
00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:25.590
so I'm gonna pull in ten years
of prior data for Arfabark.

187
00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:28.938
And you can see in these first few columns
is all the raw data that you need to

188
00:11:28.938 --> 00:11:30.080
collect to do the model.

189
00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:34.275
Then we get to the variables that
we're going to run in the model.

190
00:11:34.275 --> 00:11:37.730
Accruals divided by total assets,
change in cash revenue divided by

191
00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:42.440
prior total assets and property plant
equipment divided by prior total assets.

192
00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:45.880
Once those are calculated,
we can do a regression.

193
00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:51.600
If you want to do that in Excel,
you can click Data Analysis > Regression.

194
00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:55.260
You have to fill in the range for
accruals, that's your y variable.

195
00:11:55.260 --> 00:12:00.080
Make sure you stop at 2008, don't take
the years that you're estimating.

196
00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:05.250
Then do the same thing for the x range
where we take cash revenue and PP&E.

197
00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:08.783
Make sure Labels is checked so
that you have the coefficients labeled.

198
00:12:08.783 --> 00:12:13.702
Click Output Range, show Excel
where you want the output, hit OK,

199
00:12:13.702 --> 00:12:18.580
and voila,
you get regression coefficients down here.

200
00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:22.140
We're gonna take those coefficients and
we're gonna put them in for

201
00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:27.800
every single year cuz we're assuming
the model is stationary for Arfabark.

202
00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:33.380
Once we have the coefficients,
then we can take the normal accruals as

203
00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:38.720
a plus b times the change in cash
revenue plus c times the PP&E,

204
00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:40.940
you can see the formula
if you click on that.

205
00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:42.020
Once you get normal accruals,

206
00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:47.470
then you take accruals minus normal
accruals to get discretionary accruals.

207
00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:52.130
And then what you can see is the two
that are in red are the one we're

208
00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:54.560
interested in, 2009 and 2010.

209
00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:56.420
That's the amount for
discretionary accruals.

210
00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:58.630
Are they big or small?

211
00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:03.480
Well, the way to check would be
to compare it to the mean min and

212
00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:06.810
max over the period that
you're estimating it.

213
00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:10.630
The mean is going to be zero if you're
doing it within the sample cuz it's

214
00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:11.770
a residual.

215
00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:20.160
But notably, the 0.007 in 2009
is not greater than the max.

216
00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:24.190
The value in 2010 is less than the min, so

217
00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:29.400
that might be a suspect period in terms
of manipulating earnings downward.

218
00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:32.840
But there's no evidence in either
year of manipulating earnings upward.

219
00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:40.180
>> Professor, even a statistical
neophyte like myself knows

220
00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:43.900
that you should not use a coefficient
that is insignificant from zero.

221
00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:48.067
>> Yeah, you got me on that one.

222
00:13:48.067 --> 00:13:51.717
If you don't know a lot about regressions
you may want to go just get a drink right

223
00:13:51.717 --> 00:13:52.820
now and skip this part.

224
00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:56.140
Because it's fairly technical, or
maybe if you do know regressions,

225
00:13:56.140 --> 00:14:00.020
you should get a drink also so
I don't get in trouble for what I'm doing.

226
00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:04.610
But if you look at the t statistics and
p values, those are ways to

227
00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:08.820
test whether the coefficients are what's
called significantly different from zero.

228
00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:13.020
So, does that mean do we have confidence
that the coefficient is actually different

229
00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:14.780
than a coefficient of zero?

230
00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:18.310
And, in a lot of cases they won't
be statistically significant.

231
00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:22.660
And that's because we use pretty small
samples when we run these regressions.

232
00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:27.440
But we find that these models work anyway
because the coefficient estimate we

233
00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:31.110
get even though it is noisy,
is better than nothing.

234
00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:33.740
And we're gonna end up with
a discretionary accruals model that's

235
00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:36.520
sort of the best estimate
we can come up with.

236
00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:41.170
Again it won't be 100% accurate,
none of these statistical techniques are.

237
00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:43.820
But it's at least evidence that we can

238
00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:46.240
use to try to figure out whether
a company's manipulating or not.

239
00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:52.840
So we didn't find any evidence of
manipulation for Arfabark, but

240
00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:56.270
we didn't really suspect
any in those two years.

241
00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:59.440
This was just an example
where I pulled the data, but

242
00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:03.650
we didn't necessarily expect there was any
reason for them to manipulate earnings.

243
00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:08.990
So just to show you the model does work
in the next tab I did some manipulations.

244
00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:13.410
So for 2009 I cut bad debt expense,
I delayed a write-down,

245
00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:18.130
cut warranty expense, and
manipulated earnings upward.

246
00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:21.580
I changed all the other variables
that would change as a result.

247
00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:27.325
And voila, the Discretionary Accruals
model gives us a value of

248
00:15:27.325 --> 00:15:33.090
0.062 in 2009 which is much, much greater
than the max during the estimation period.

249
00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:36.500
And would suggest evidence
of earnings manipulation.

250
00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:41.280
In the next tab I also did it
with just a sales manipulation.

251
00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:45.540
So I just manipulated revenue, changed
all the variables that would also change.

252
00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:49.430
You get a discretionary accruals
number of 0.058, which again,

253
00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:54.450
is greater than the max in the period
that we estimated the model and

254
00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:57.740
would lead you to suspect
earnings manipulation.

255
00:15:57.740 --> 00:16:01.020
Again, as long as you had some other
basis to think that there were incentives

256
00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:03.100
to manage earnings during the period.

257
00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:07.692
But I just wanted to show you if you
inject a manipulation into this data,

258
00:16:07.692 --> 00:16:11.472
you can pick it up with
the discretionary accruals models.

259
00:16:11.472 --> 00:16:16.399
Now let me show you the cross-sectional
regression approach.

260
00:16:16.399 --> 00:16:21.278
So the first step is to pull in all
of the company's data that's in

261
00:16:21.278 --> 00:16:23.686
the same industry as Arfabark.

262
00:16:23.686 --> 00:16:26.930
Their SIC code was 2670.

263
00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:31.227
I grab just the first two digits and
took all the firms that were in SIC codes

264
00:16:31.227 --> 00:16:34.830
starting with 2,
6 to get as big f sample as possible.

265
00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:37.560
And I came up with 51 companies.

266
00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:42.750
So then for 2009, I have all the data for
those 51 companies and

267
00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:46.600
then I would run the regression,
data analysis regression,

268
00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:49.610
I wanna highlight the y column.

269
00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:55.240
Highlight the two columns for
x, make sure Labels is clicked,

270
00:16:56.310 --> 00:17:01.940
choose my output range,
hit OK, and I get coefficients.

271
00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:04.020
Now those coefficients are just for 2009.

272
00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:09.650
So I'll carry those over into another tab.

273
00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:15.400
In this tab all the data is the same out
to where you get to the coefficients and

274
00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:18.420
then the coefficients are what I
get from the cross sectional model.

275
00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:23.060
Notice that they vary by year
which means that I had to run

276
00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:26.840
the industry regression every year to get
different coefficients for every year.

277
00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:30.280
After doing that,
then I can do the normal accruals and

278
00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:32.240
the discretionary accruals the same way.

279
00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:37.020
I get discretionary accruals of 0.019,
which is small, but again,

280
00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:39.990
we don't suspect any manipulation.

281
00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:40.960
In the next two tabs,

282
00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:46.090
which you can check out in detail on your
own, I inject multiple manipulations.

283
00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:49.145
Again, the bad debt write downs and
warranty expense.

284
00:17:49.145 --> 00:17:54.566
And discretion accruals
jumps up from 0.09 to 0.072.

285
00:17:54.566 --> 00:18:02.192
And if I just do the sales manipulation I
can also pick it up, it jumps up to 0.070.

286
00:18:02.192 --> 00:18:03.493
>> I am a busy kid.

287
00:18:03.493 --> 00:18:09.229
I do soccer, chess, dance, pottery,
swimming and judo after school.

288
00:18:09.229 --> 00:18:12.760
I don't have time to run
all of these regressions.

289
00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:14.780
What do you propose I do with all of this?

290
00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:20.150
>> Yeah, I know that's a lot
of different ways to do it.

291
00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:24.480
The most common way that people will
do this is what we just looked at with

292
00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:26.320
the cross-sectional regression.

293
00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:29.990
So in other words the industry
regressions by year.

294
00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:33.540
And then apply those coefficients
to all the firms in the industry.

295
00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:37.810
And people tend to do it that way because
you can usually get more observations of

296
00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:42.380
firms within the industry than you can
number of years in a company's history.

297
00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:44.630
And then you can also apply
this to younger firms.

298
00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:48.490
You don't need a long time
history to do the regressions.

299
00:18:48.490 --> 00:18:52.010
What I'm going to do to make this easier
for you cuz I do realize you have judo and

300
00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:55.280
jazz and dance and
all that stuff also in your life

301
00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:59.840
is on the course platform I'll give
you a spreadsheet of coefficients.

302
00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:03.710
So I will run these regressions
by industry by year.

303
00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:06.310
And make all the coefficients
available to you on a spreadsheet so

304
00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:09.670
all you have to do is pull
them off the spreadsheet, and

305
00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:12.460
then you can use it without having
to run these regressions yourself.

306
00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:17.810
Now that we've seen how to estimate these
models what we'll do in the next video

307
00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:22.510
is try them out on three different
cases to see how well they work.

308
00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:23.130
I'll see you then.

309
00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:26.535
>> See you next video.
