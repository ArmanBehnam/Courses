00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:04.840
Hello I'm Professor Brian Bushee.

2
00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:05.830
Welcome back.

3
00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.070
In this video we're going to continue our
look at Discretionary Expenditure Models.

4
00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.450
I'm going to introduce two
refinements that will help us better

5
00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.190
use these models to detect
earnings management.

6
00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:20.340
One will be something called the Distance
Measure, which will help us understand

7
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.430
a manager's motives to manipulate
earnings using a given expenditure.

8
00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.670
And second, we'll look at
Quarterly Changes in the expenditures,

9
00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:30.790
to help us find Earnings Management.

10
00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:32.270
Once we go over those refinements,

11
00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.930
I've got three brief cases to show
you how all this stuff will work.

12
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:37.700
Let's get started.

13
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.270
So we need to do some refinements to the
discretionary expenditure models because

14
00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:44.970
they are very imprecise.

15
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.860
We still haven't addressed the problem
that the Economics of the firm may have

16
00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.150
shifted which warrants a legitimate
change in expenditures

17
00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:58.460
making it harder to spot manipulation
using discretionary expenditures.

18
00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.340
So our first refinement is we're
gonna come up with something called

19
00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.240
a Distance Measure and
I'll show you that in a little bit.

20
00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.895
But this distance measure
will help us identify

21
00:01:06.895 --> 00:01:09.790
companies' earnings management
motives during the year.

22
00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.840
So one type of company that distance
measure will help us identify

23
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.590
is a company that would miss its earnings
target without a cut in expenditures.

24
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.060
For example, unless they cut
their R&D expense by say 2%,

25
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.350
they won't meet their earnings target.

26
00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.920
We're gonna call these Meet or
Beat firms, so

27
00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.200
their incentive is to cut their
expenditure just that little bit so

28
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.250
that they can meet or
beat their earnings target.

29
00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.790
The distance measure will also
identify a company that would

30
00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.640
miss its earnings target even
with a cut in expenditures.

31
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.830
So this means that if you cut
your R&D all the way to zero,

32
00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.950
you would still miss your earnings target,
it wouldn't be a big enough savings in

33
00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.280
expense to meet your earnings target,
we're gonna call these Big Bath firms.

34
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.290
Here the incentive is to increase
their expenditures to make a bad year

35
00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.700
even worse, but save future expenses.

36
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.700
For example, if a company
accelerated its R&D spending, so

37
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.670
things they planned to spend on
next year it spent on it this year.

38
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.840
It would make its bad year even worse,
but it's still a bad year.

39
00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.860
But what it would do is it would
help the recovery next year because

40
00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.950
next years R&D expenses would be lower and

41
00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.610
earnings higher because you've accelerated
some of those into the current period.

42
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.940
And the last group we can identify with
the distance measure would be a company

43
00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.650
that would make an earnings target
even with an increase in expenditure.

44
00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.010
So the company could
increase it's R&D by 3% and

45
00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.010
still meet its earnings target,
even with the higher expense.

46
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.000
We're gonna call these smoothing firms.

47
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.710
Here the incentive is to increase your
expenditure to make a great year just

48
00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:54.000
a good year and
again save future expenses.

49
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.370
So if you increase R&D from 3% to 5%,

50
00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.490
it still allows you to make your
earnings target and what you've done

51
00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:06.930
is you've saved some expenses in
the future, helping next year's results.

52
00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.900
So that's what the Distance Measure's
gonna help us do.

53
00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:14.580
The second refinement is to use quarterly
expenses to identify unusual changes

54
00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:15.900
late in the year.

55
00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.040
As we've talked about before,
normal business activities should cause

56
00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.880
changes to happen throughout the year,
but earnings management

57
00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.940
is more likely to cause the changes
to be concentrated late in the year,

58
00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.320
when the manager realizes they need to
do something to manipulate earnings.

59
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.560
>> Another oxymoron?

60
00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.040
I have been to Bath and
it is certainly not big!

61
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.270
>> This is not referring to Bath, England.

62
00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:47.120
I've never been able to find a definitive
source for the origin of this term.

63
00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.980
What I've heard is that it's
a reference to the fact that

64
00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.760
companies used to write losses in red ink.

65
00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.200
So profits would be written in black ink,
losses in red ink.

66
00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.680
And so a loss meant the company was
taking a bath in red ink and so

67
00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.760
a big loss would be a big bath in red ink.

68
00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.250
So big bath means big loss.

69
00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.470
I mean, whatever the origin,
it's become a well established term for

70
00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.890
incentives to take a huge loss this period

71
00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:17.589
in order to try to make your earnings
look better in future periods.

72
00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.810
Let's take a look at how to
calculate the distance measure and

73
00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.150
we'll look at R&D first.

74
00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.904
So the Distance Measure = (Current

75
00:04:27.904 --> 00:04:36.260
Pre-R&D Earnings- Prior Pre-R&D Earnings)
/ Prior R&D Expense.

76
00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.040
When I say Pre-R&D Earnings,
what I mean is the Pre-tax Income.

77
00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.418
Plus R&D expense, so we remove R&D
from Pre-tax Income to see what

78
00:04:44.418 --> 00:04:47.662
the income would be without
any R&D spending, and

79
00:04:47.662 --> 00:04:50.990
then you can also do this for
SG&A and advertising.

80
00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.540
You just replace R&D
with one of those two.

81
00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.530
So, here's an example
of how it's calculated.

82
00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.060
Let's say, in 2014,
Pre-tax Income was 500,

83
00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:05.640
2015 it's 505/ R&D Expense was 90 and
84 so

84
00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.750
if we add Pre-tax Income and R&D Expense,
we get 590 in 2014 and 589 in 2015.

85
00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:14.796
So the Distance Measure in this

86
00:05:14.796 --> 00:05:20.425
case would be (589-590)

87
00:05:20.425 --> 00:05:24.710
/ 90 = -0.011.

88
00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:29.900
The way to interpret that is
the company would need to cut R&D by

89
00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:35.440
1.1%, say from 90 to 89,
to equal last year's earnings.

90
00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.260
And you can see this in the table.

91
00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:42.960
If they had cut R&D from 90 to 89, their
pretax income would have been 500 and

92
00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.530
they would have just met
last year's earnings.

93
00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:49.860
Now as it turns out,
they cut R&D by more than that and

94
00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:54.225
what it did was it allowed them to
take what would have been a decline in

95
00:05:54.225 --> 00:06:00.079
Pre-R&D Earnings and turn it into
an increase in Pre-tax Income.

96
00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.690
So the companies that we're
gonna look at as Meet and

97
00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:10.370
Beat Incentives will be ones where
the distance measures between zero and

98
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:14.180
negative 0.20, or negative 20% or so.

99
00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:17.530
Because in that case,
the company could cut r and

100
00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:19.539
d enough to meet its earnings target.

101
00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:26.050
>> I love the exacting
imprecision of -0.20 or so.

102
00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:30.305
My sister says one should always
avoid strikingly soft demarcations.

103
00:06:30.305 --> 00:06:35.390
>> [LAUGH] Exacting imprecision,
nice use of oxymoron again.

104
00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:37.710
Yeah, so
I don't know where this cut-off is.

105
00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:41.230
I do know that at some point
if a company cut too much R&D,

106
00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:45.640
then they're destroying the company's
value because they could be sacrificing

107
00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:49.310
investment in projects they need
to perform well in the future.

108
00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:52.760
And if they cut too much, it's just gonna
simply be very noticeable to investors,

109
00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:54.510
and they'll see right through it.

110
00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:58.110
So I don't where the number is, it's
probably the case that some companies have

111
00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:02.680
cut 25% to manage earnings, where as other
companies have needed to cut 15%, but

112
00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:05.420
didn't because they
thought it was too large.

113
00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:09.216
This is gonna be somewhere
in this neighborhood and

114
00:07:09.216 --> 00:07:11.349
it's gonna be exactingly imprecise.

115
00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:17.720
Anyway, a Big Bath incentive would be
indicated by a Distance Measure that's

116
00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:20.530
less than -0.20 or so.

117
00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:21.450
So less than 20%.

118
00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:24.270
Cuz in that case the company could

119
00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:28.250
really not feasibly cut enough R&D
to meet their earnings target.

120
00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:30.958
Sure, they may be able to
cut 40% of their R&D or

121
00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:33.280
80% of their R&D to meet the target.

122
00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:35.900
But then that would also
be very obvious to people,

123
00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:39.320
which would not make it a very effective
way to manipulate your earnings.

124
00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:44.120
And finally, the Distance Measure will
indicate a smoothing incentive anytime

125
00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.840
the Distance Measure's greater than zero,
cuz in that case,

126
00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:50.580
the company could increase R&D and
still meet its earnings target.

127
00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:58.080
Second refinement we're gonna look at are
Quarterly Changes in these expenditures.

128
00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:00.710
Some firms report quarterly
amounts of expense.

129
00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:04.140
I say some firms because
it's not mandatory.

130
00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:06.610
It's essentially a voluntary disclosure.

131
00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:09.470
To give you a sense of
how voluntary it is,

132
00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:14.330
in 2015 about 95% of companies
reported quarterly SG&A because that's

133
00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:18.500
somebody that all investors want to
see even though it's not required.

134
00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:21.620
But 30% of companies
reported quarterly R&D and

135
00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:24.680
nobody actually reported
quarterly advertising expense.

136
00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:26.189
So we can't use it for advertising.

137
00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:29.950
We're gonna look at our
year over year change or

138
00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:33.950
YOY change, which would be the expense
this quarter minus the expense the same

139
00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:38.010
quarter the last year divided by that
expense the same quarter the last year.

140
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:42.460
If discretionary expenditures are used
to manipulate annual earnings,

141
00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:45.500
we would expect that the YOY
change in the 4th quarter

142
00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:47.800
is different than the other 3 quarters.

143
00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:51.530
So for the Meet and Beat incentive,
you would expect to see cuts in R&D in

144
00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:56.790
the fourth quarter, as they try to meet
their target, whereas for Big Bath or

145
00:08:56.790 --> 00:09:00.720
Smoothing incentives, you might see a big
increase in R&D in the fourth quarter,

146
00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:04.300
as they realized they should
accelerate some of these expenditures

147
00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:08.430
to make their earnings lower this year,
but help their earnings next year.

148
00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:13.232
So we wanna look at the pattern of
quarterly changes in these expenses,

149
00:09:13.232 --> 00:09:17.343
when available, in conjunction with
the discretionary expenditure measures and

150
00:09:17.343 --> 00:09:21.277
the distance measure, to get the most
complete evidence on whether there might

151
00:09:21.277 --> 00:09:22.646
be manipulation going on.

152
00:09:25.026 --> 00:09:28.730
>> Can we make any definite
guesses about earnings management?

153
00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:32.431
Based on whether companies
transparently hide their quarterly R&D?

154
00:09:32.431 --> 00:09:35.490
>> Excellent question.

155
00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:39.760
I think the big thing that determines
whether a company discloses quarterly R&D

156
00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:43.160
or not is how important R&D is for
the company.

157
00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:46.800
So companies where R&D is
a huge part of their business,

158
00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:49.660
investors will demand the information
on a quarterly basis and

159
00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:53.500
companies will provide it,
companies where R&D's not as important,

160
00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:57.020
there's not as much demand to see
it quarterly and you won't see it.

161
00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:59.940
Now if a company did start
disclosing a quarterly and

162
00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:02.970
then stopped, that would be
very suspicious to investors.

163
00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:06.140
They would try to figure out hey,
why are they taking away this disclosure.

164
00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:09.530
And the inference would be that
maybe they are trying to manipulate.

165
00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:13.180
So for that reason, if a company really
was trying to manipulate its R&D,

166
00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:17.680
it would probably still
continue to disclose it, so

167
00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:21.380
as to not raise immediate
suspicion as to what it's doing.

168
00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:25.110
So, we tend to see the companies,
once they report quarterly R&D,

169
00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:26.710
tend to always do it.

170
00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:30.490
And so, we're gonna look at the quarterly
changes to try to make attributions

171
00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:32.160
not whether they reported or not.

172
00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:39.220
Now, we're gonna look at a number of cases
to illustrate how to use these tools.

173
00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:42.910
And instead of making you wait
through all the data in a spreadsheet,

174
00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:46.360
I pulled summaries into Power Point
to make it easy for us to look at.

175
00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:51.140
The first case is a company
that had a possible meet or

176
00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:54.850
beat incentive to manipulate
their expenditures.

177
00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:58.190
And in each case, we're going to
look at research and development.

178
00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:00.680
So this is Dog-Techno Corp.

179
00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:05.590
In 2013 they had a negative
discretionary R&D measure.

180
00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:09.700
Which was a bigger negative than in the
past, so that means they spent less on R&D

181
00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:13.250
than expected, potentially cut
it to manipulate their earnings.

182
00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:17.260
If we look at their distance measure,
it was a very James Bondian -0.007.

183
00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:22.131
What that means is that
if they cut their R&D,

184
00:11:22.131 --> 00:11:26.325
by just seven-tenths of a percent,
they would have reversed their

185
00:11:26.325 --> 00:11:30.660
Pre-R&D earnings decline and made it
a positive change in pretax income.

186
00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:33.530
So, they're very close to their target.

187
00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:38.346
If we look at their quarterly changes
in R&D, you can see that the quarterly

188
00:11:38.346 --> 00:11:43.689
changes get smaller each quarter, and then
are actually negative in quarter four,

189
00:11:43.689 --> 00:11:48.410
suggesting a cut R&D relative to
the prior year in quarter four.

190
00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:52.900
And in the last column is the change
in Pre-tax income divided by revenue,

191
00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:55.570
just scaling it to make
it easy to look at.

192
00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:59.440
So if this is positive, it means their
income was higher than last year, negative

193
00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:04.110
means it's lower and, sure enough,
they meet their earnings target this year.

194
00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:09.170
And this would be a pattern which
would suggest a cut in R&D in order to

195
00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:11.230
meet your earnings target
from the prior year.

196
00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:16.430
Second case is a possible
Big Bath situation.

197
00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:18.590
This is Rexido Corp.

198
00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:21.020
So if we look at their
discretionary R&D in 2007,

199
00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:25.890
it was a big positive number,
much bigger than in the past.

200
00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:29.420
Which means they spent
more on R&D than expected

201
00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:31.570
which is gonna reduce their earnings.

202
00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:33.540
If we look at their distance measure,

203
00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:38.393
it was -0.634 which means they
would have to cut R&D by 63%

204
00:12:38.393 --> 00:12:43.070
in order to meet their earnings target
which makes it a potential big bath.

205
00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:47.170
And then we look at the quarterly changes,
the quarterly changes get bigger each

206
00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:52.990
quarter and then it's an enormous 435%
increase in R&D in the fourth quarter.

207
00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:56.100
And sure enough the last
column shows that they

208
00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:57.900
missed their earnings target by a lot.

209
00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:03.170
Their earnings were down by 13% of
revenue versus the prior year, so

210
00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:05.180
this would be consistent with a Big Bath.

211
00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:07.600
They knew they couldn't
meet last year's target.

212
00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:12.210
So they accelerated some of next year's
R&D into this year to make the bad

213
00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:15.480
year worse, but then hopefully help
their turnaround in the following year.

214
00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:22.250
And then the last situation is
a potential Smoothing situation.

215
00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:29.110
The company we're gonna
look at here is NDOGTHA.

216
00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:34.610
They also had a big,
positive discretionary R&D in 2006,

217
00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:38.860
indicating they spent more
on R&D than expected.

218
00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:40.080
Their distance measure was 0.935,

219
00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:45.740
which means they could increase their
R&D by 93% over the prior year.

220
00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:48.570
And still have an increase in earnings.

221
00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:53.360
When we look at the quarterly pattern,
we see a big increase in YoY R&D in

222
00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:58.318
the forth quarter and in the last column,
they still did meet their earnings target.

223
00:13:58.318 --> 00:14:04.370
They were 5.8% of revenue above
last year's Pre-tax income.

224
00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:09.630
So this is consistent with smoothing where
they made a great year a good year by

225
00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:14.150
accelerating some R&D expenses from last
year, next year into the fourth quarter of

226
00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:19.430
this year to reduce earnings but then
save some expenditures for the future.

227
00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:24.950
And that wraps up our look at
Discretionary Expenditure Models.

228
00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:29.840
So you have another tool for your toolkit
in detecting earnings management.

229
00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:33.990
In the next video we're gonna take
a different approach to trying to look for

230
00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:35.110
manipulation.

231
00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:38.250
We're gonna look at models that take
a look at firms that we know have

232
00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:39.440
committed fraud.

233
00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:42.070
Compare them to firms that
didn't commit fraud and

234
00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:44.110
try to see what makes them different.

235
00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:46.940
What makes them different are variables
that we could use to potentially

236
00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:48.600
predict fraud.

237
00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:49.350
I'll see you next time.

238
00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:52.564
>> See you next video.
