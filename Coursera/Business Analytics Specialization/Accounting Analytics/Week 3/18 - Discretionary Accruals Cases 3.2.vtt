00:00:03.147 --> 00:00:05.090
Hello, I'm Professor Brian Bushee.

2
00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:07.938
Welcome back.
In this video we're gonna look at three

3
00:00:07.938 --> 00:00:12.410
cases where we can apply
the discretionary accruals model.

4
00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.330
For each company we'll learn a little bit
about their business and what's going on.

5
00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.320
Then we'll calculate their discretionary
accruals measures, look for

6
00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.780
time trends in the measure and

7
00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:27.760
compare those time trends to competitors
to see if the company looks unusual.

8
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.220
That'll allow us to draw some conclusions
on whether the discretionary accruals is

9
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.330
picking up earnings management or not.

10
00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.810
So we'll get a chance to see how
well these models really work

11
00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:39.780
on some real companies.

12
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:40.500
Let's get started.

13
00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.080
The first case we're gonna look
at is Pawsome Electronics.

14
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.175
Pawsome Electronics manufactures
consumer products for dogs, things like

15
00:00:50.175 --> 00:00:54.190
microchip-enabled food bowls, electric
toothbrushes, soothing-sound machines,

16
00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.990
electric blankets and, of course, they're
well-known aromatherapy vaporizers.

17
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.716
The company was struggling in 2012-2013,
so

18
00:01:02.716 --> 00:01:05.327
they brought in a new CEO
who was a turnaround expert.

19
00:01:05.327 --> 00:01:10.333
That CEO made a number of changes
in 2013-2014, including increasing

20
00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:14.749
the marketing budget, reducing
the product line to focus on winners,

21
00:01:14.749 --> 00:01:19.388
closing a number of factories and
cutting the workforce substantially and

22
00:01:19.388 --> 00:01:25.080
implementing a new just-in-time automatic
retail delivery system with its customers.

23
00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.190
>> I am feeling deja vu
hearing about this company.

24
00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.769
>> Nice job recycling old material, prof!

25
00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:35.730
>> Guilty as charged.

26
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:40.780
Yes, I have used Pawsome in another video,
but I'm recycling it on purpose.

27
00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.920
Cuz in the prior video, we saw that
Pawsome engaged in a channel-stuffing

28
00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.707
scheme to boost their revenue.

29
00:01:46.707 --> 00:01:49.203
So I thought maybe we
should bring them back and

30
00:01:49.203 --> 00:01:53.770
see if we could detect their manipulation
with the discretionary accruals models.

31
00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.850
So first I'll review what
their manipulation was.

32
00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.520
Then we'll look at the numbers and
see if they work in a case where we know

33
00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.040
that the managers actually
committed some manipulation.

34
00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.470
Yes, so as we saw in an earlier video,

35
00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.480
Pawsome's CEO had engaged in
a channel-stuffing scheme in 2014.

36
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.869
He manipulated the automatic just-in-time
system to deliver extra goods to retailers

37
00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:19.910
just before the quarter end which
helped increase revenue and

38
00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.140
meet the company's earnings targets but,
of course, all the revenue was noncash.

39
00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.764
And then the retailers just returned that
excess inventory to Pawsome in the next

40
00:02:28.764 --> 00:02:30.020
quarter.

41
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.310
So let's bring up the spreadsheet and
take a look at whether the discretionary

42
00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.276
accruals model would have picked
up this channel-stuffing behavior.

43
00:02:39.963 --> 00:02:45.770
Here is the spreadsheet which has data for
Pawsome and four of its competitors.

44
00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.770
So we've seen Chienco and
Fidotronics before.

45
00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.150
I also brought in Hund AG and
National Pooch.

46
00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.710
I brought in the five years of data
leading up to 2014 so we can look for

47
00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:58.020
some time trends.

48
00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.240
The first set of columns is all
the raw data that we need to compute

49
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.290
the discretionary accruals.

50
00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.060
Then the purple columns are the variables
that go into the model.

51
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.570
The orange-ish columns
are the coefficients from the model.

52
00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.520
These coefficients were estimated using
cross-sectional or industry regression.

53
00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.447
So if you look,
2010 is gonna be the same coefficient for

54
00:03:19.447 --> 00:03:22.010
each of the five companies.

55
00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.610
Normally, you could just go to
the spreadsheet I posted with all these

56
00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.300
parameters and bring them in.

57
00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.402
I say normally because with Pawsome,

58
00:03:29.402 --> 00:03:32.630
I also disguised the year
that this fraud happened.

59
00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.690
So you won't actually find these
coefficients under 2010 to 2014, but

60
00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.860
normally this will work.

61
00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.380
Anyway, in column T,

62
00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.332
I have the discretionary accruals
that we calculated from the model.

63
00:03:43.332 --> 00:03:45.816
Brought in numbers to fight through so
let's put them in some graphs.

64
00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:54.290
First, here is a graph that
shows just Pawsome alone.

65
00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.233
And what we see is a downward trend
in discretionary accruals and

66
00:04:00.233 --> 00:04:03.043
then a huge spike upward in 2014.

67
00:04:03.043 --> 00:04:07.679
So this would be suggestive of using
discretionary accruals to manipulate

68
00:04:07.679 --> 00:04:09.450
earnings during 2014.

69
00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.070
But let's bring in
the four competitors and

70
00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:16.090
see how Pawsome stacks up
against its competition.

71
00:04:17.512 --> 00:04:19.990
And so if you look again at Pawsome,

72
00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:24.880
the purple line, it's the only one
that's really spiking up a lot.

73
00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.358
It looks like Hund AG is
also going up in 2014, but

74
00:04:29.358 --> 00:04:32.450
it doesn't get that far above zero.

75
00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.790
National Pooch also going up a little bit,
but

76
00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:37.580
that's really just bouncing
around within a small range.

77
00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.370
Fidotronics and
Chienco were actually down.

78
00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.520
So, looking at this graph, I would say
the discretionary accruals model suggests

79
00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.760
there's pretty compelling evidence
that Pawsome manipulated its earnings.

80
00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.910
But then we would again check to see
whether they have earnings management and

81
00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:56.100
incentives, which they have quite a few
of as we've talked about in prior videos.

82
00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:00.881
So the model does seem to pick up the fact
the Pawsome was manipulating its earnings

83
00:05:00.881 --> 00:05:02.000
during 2014.

84
00:05:04.809 --> 00:05:09.460
The next case we're gonna look at is
the company Cat Pharm Incorporated.

85
00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.210
Cat Pharm is a leading manufacturer
of pharmaceuticals for cats.

86
00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:19.147
Its breakthrough drug was Catacnex, which
was a cure for severe feline chin acne.

87
00:05:20.975 --> 00:05:22.473
>> Seriously?

88
00:05:22.473 --> 00:05:26.660
After all of these dog companies,
you throw in a cat company?

89
00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:31.990
>> As you'll see,
this company's earnings management motives

90
00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:35.690
are very different from what
we've seen in prior companies.

91
00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:40.080
So since I had a contrarian company,
I figured I'd illustrate it with

92
00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.790
a contrarian animal, and so
we'll look at a cat company.

93
00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.450
The company allegedly used
its monopoly position

94
00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:51.760
in this drug to coerce
health insurance plans and

95
00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:56.760
pharmacies to also carry other over-priced
medicines produced by the company.

96
00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.810
In other words, they would say,
unless you carry our other medicines,

97
00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:03.579
we're gonna reduce your
access to Catacnex.

98
00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.113
So, this happened back in the 90s.

99
00:06:06.113 --> 00:06:11.244
In 1996, Cat Pharm was accused by
the US Justice Department of monopolistic

100
00:06:11.244 --> 00:06:16.230
practices and violation of the RICO Act,
which is a racketeering act.

101
00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:18.880
You can Google that on your own
if you wanna know what it is, but

102
00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.050
it's pretty serious stuff.

103
00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:26.650
The company then reached a settlement with
the Feds and paid a modest fine in 1997.

104
00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:30.520
Then the next year in 1998, Cat Pharm
announced it was gonna merge with

105
00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:34.250
Animaux Med,
a large French pet pharmaceutical company.

106
00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:39.590
Both the US Attorney General and
the European Commissioner for Competition

107
00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:44.270
announced they would seek to block the
merger to prevent a worldwide monopoly.

108
00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:47.090
And Cat Pharm claimed that there
was simply no evidence that it's

109
00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:49.460
able to earn monopoly
profits in its business.

110
00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:54.188
So we're gonna look at Cat Pharm's
discretionary accruals model for

111
00:06:54.188 --> 00:06:58.828
both 1996 and 1998 to see if there was
anything unusual because they may have had

112
00:06:58.828 --> 00:07:02.101
some incentives to manipulate
earnings during those years.

113
00:07:04.782 --> 00:07:09.550
Here is the tab in the spreadsheet
with all the data for Cat Pharm.

114
00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:12.740
I had trouble finding competitors for
Cat Pharm for

115
00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:16.050
some reason so
I only have three competitors.

116
00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:18.777
And you can see all the data and
you can look through it on your own but

117
00:07:18.777 --> 00:07:20.500
let me show you what the graphs look like.

118
00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:24.310
So here's the discretionary accruals for
Cat Pharm alone and

119
00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:28.790
you can see there's a big drop in 1996 and
another drop in 1998.

120
00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:33.370
Well, hopefully,
you realized that Cat Pharm

121
00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:37.230
actually has incentives to make
their earnings look worse.

122
00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:40.760
Normally, we think about companies trying
to make their earnings look better.

123
00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:44.385
But if you're accused of being
a monopoly and racketeering,

124
00:07:44.385 --> 00:07:49.057
you wanna make your earnings go down so
you look like you're less profitable and

125
00:07:49.057 --> 00:07:52.424
that's what it looks like
Cat Pharm did in 96 and 98.

126
00:07:52.424 --> 00:07:54.711
Now let's compare them to the competitors.

127
00:07:54.711 --> 00:07:56.231
And we can see in 96,

128
00:07:56.231 --> 00:08:01.831
Cat Pharm was clearly way down whereas the
rest of the competitors were above zero,

129
00:08:01.831 --> 00:08:07.290
although MedicinaGos did seem to have a
little bit of drop but it dropped to zero.

130
00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:11.664
And then if we look at 1998,
again, Cat Pharm is way down but

131
00:08:11.664 --> 00:08:15.311
you don't see the same big drop for
its competitors.

132
00:08:17.793 --> 00:08:24.190
>> Honey, it looks like the green line
company is also down in the last year.

133
00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:28.220
So, how can you all conclude
that Cat Pharm is manipulating?

134
00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:32.270
>> That actually raises
an excellent point.

135
00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:34.430
When we look at competitors,

136
00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:38.320
we assume that they do not have
incentives to manipulate, and so

137
00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:42.610
they're providing a good benchmark for
non-manipulated numbers.

138
00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:44.750
And so the company that we're
concerned about manipulating,

139
00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:48.060
if they look different,
then it's probably manipulation.

140
00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:51.290
But what would happen if one of
the competitors also had incentives

141
00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:52.450
to manipulate?

142
00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:54.950
And that is what I think is going on here

143
00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:59.040
because Animaux Med also wants
the merger to go through.

144
00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:02.985
They know that monopoly considerations
are gonna be a stumbling block so

145
00:09:02.985 --> 00:09:07.490
Animaux Med also has incentives
to make their earnings lower

146
00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:10.850
in the same year as Cat Pharm
to get the merger approved.

147
00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:12.770
So in this case, both Animaux Med and

148
00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:15.970
Cat Pharm have the incentives to
make their earnings look lower and

149
00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:19.580
the competitors, the other two companies,
are the ones we should use as

150
00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:22.790
the benchmark cuz we don't know that
they have any incentives to manipulate.

151
00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:27.590
So our last case looks at
a company called Pup Phone.

152
00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:30.456
Pup Phone is a leading manufacturer
of phone receivers for dogs.

153
00:09:30.456 --> 00:09:33.982
Many owners wanna telephone
their dogs during the workday,

154
00:09:33.982 --> 00:09:36.990
just pick up the phone and
give them a call.

155
00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:39.070
But the problem is,
dogs can't pick up phones.

156
00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:41.860
The whole lack of opposable thumbs
causes the big issue again.

157
00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:45.860
So, Pup Phone had developed
a technology where a dog could

158
00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:50.240
press its snout against a sensor pad to
answer the phone when a light flashed to

159
00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:51.880
indicate an incoming call.

160
00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:55.560
So this technology boomed
when it first developed, but

161
00:09:55.560 --> 00:10:00.660
Pup Phone has had stagnant growth and
lower profits in 2010 and 2011.

162
00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:04.220
The competitors are also
struggling because they're

163
00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:06.602
starting to be market saturation
in this kind of system.

164
00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:11.540
The company Board has given Pup Phone
management a vote of confidence at

165
00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:13.510
the annual shareholder meeting, but

166
00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:16.520
we all know that that does not
necessarily mean good news.

167
00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:22.570
In 2012, Pup Phone and its competitors
rolled out new technology products.

168
00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:25.250
They had developed
the barktooth technology,

169
00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:29.580
which allows the dog to simply bark at
the flashing light to answer the phone.

170
00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:32.900
And that led to a huge increase
in revenues and net income for

171
00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:33.844
the company in 2012.

172
00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:37.230
>> Barktooth?

173
00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:39.470
Professor, I think you need a vacation.

174
00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:44.990
>> I do need a vacation, and I'm gonna
take a vacation as soon as I finished

175
00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:46.980
doing all of these videos so
let's keep going.

176
00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:50.110
So we go to the spreadsheet.

177
00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:55.124
Here is the data for Pup Phone and
four of its competitors, DogDial, DTC,

178
00:10:55.124 --> 00:11:00.560
NuHound and PetcomCo., so again,
you can look through the data on your own.

179
00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:03.851
I've got a graph which
shows Pup Phone alone.

180
00:11:03.851 --> 00:11:10.370
And lookie there, huge spike upwards
in discretionary accruals during 2012.

181
00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:15.194
So they get the vote of confidence from
the Board and lo and behold, we right away

182
00:11:15.194 --> 00:11:20.162
see this huge spike in discretionary
accruals, suggesting earnings management

183
00:11:20.162 --> 00:11:25.200
in response to the manipulation to
turn the company around immediately.

184
00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:28.413
Well, let's just take a look
at the competitors and

185
00:11:28.413 --> 00:11:30.968
see what they look like also, and, huh,

186
00:11:30.968 --> 00:11:35.658
it looks like all of the companies
were up substantially in 2012, huh.

187
00:11:38.391 --> 00:11:42.780
>> LOL,
it looks like the model was an epic fail.

188
00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:47.480
>> What sweetly convoluted explanation
are you going to offer for this situation?

189
00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:52.290
>> I brought in the example
of this company precisely for

190
00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:56.620
the reason that I wanted to show you
a situation where the model doesn't work.

191
00:11:56.620 --> 00:12:00.110
So, in this case, there was
a technological innovation in the industry

192
00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:05.330
during the year, which means that every
company's results was a mix of old and

193
00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:09.340
new technology sales probably
happening at different times.

194
00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:12.870
And as a result,
the model just does not do a good job

195
00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:17.230
of modeling expected levels
of noncash earnings.

196
00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:20.310
So it's a situation where if you
looked at one company alone,

197
00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:22.170
you would conclude earnings management.

198
00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:25.630
But when you compare it to the competitors
and see that all the competitors have

199
00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:29.950
the same pattern, then it's more
likely that it's bad model fit.

200
00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:33.200
Now another possibility is maybe all
the competitors are managing earnings in

201
00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:34.040
the same year.

202
00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:37.660
It has happened before and
it would look like this kind of pattern.

203
00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:41.470
But the fact that we know there was this
technological innovation makes it much

204
00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:46.740
more likely that it was bad model fit
than it was group earnings management.

205
00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:50.450
But this highlights the importance of
looking at the competitor's results

206
00:12:50.450 --> 00:12:54.290
to gather additional data to help you
make a conclusion about whether a company

207
00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:55.750
is manipulating its earnings or not.

208
00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:02.650
That wraps up our look at
discretionary accruals models.

209
00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:03.670
It turns out, though,

210
00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:08.290
that manipulating accruals is not
the only way to manipulate earnings.

211
00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:11.140
You could also manipulate
the cash component of earnings.

212
00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:15.140
And that's what we're gonna look at next
video when we talk about discretionary

213
00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:16.470
expenditures.

214
00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:17.070
I'll see you then.

215
00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:19.464
>> See you next video!
