00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.210
Hello I'm Professor Brian Bushee,
welcome back.

2
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.588
In this video, we're going to let the data
speak, literally let the data speak.

3
00:00:10.588 --> 00:00:16.110
We're gonna throw out any notion of
trying to model discretionary earnings or

4
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:21.620
unusual trends and ratios and instead just
look at the distribution of the numbers.

5
00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:26.350
There's something called Benford's Law,
which reports how frequently certain

6
00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.600
numbers appear in naturally
generated data sets.

7
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.100
But that means that in artificially
generated data sets, for example,

8
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.410
financial statements that have been
manipulated through earnings management,

9
00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.650
the numbers won't appear in the same
frequency as Benford's Law.

10
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:43.900
And so we can look for

11
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.216
deviations from Benford's Law to find
financial statements that look fishy.

12
00:00:48.216 --> 00:00:52.580
It's pretty off-the-wall stuff but
it's gaining prominence

13
00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.880
as a fraud detection tool, so
let's take a look at how it works.

14
00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.040
Okay, for our last model we're gonna throw
away all notions of trying to model any

15
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.295
discretionary earnings or
fraud prediction ratios.

16
00:01:05.295 --> 00:01:09.109
And instead we're just gonna let the data
speak, to tell us whether it's true or

17
00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:10.750
whether it's been manipulated.

18
00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.510
And we're gonna do this with
something called Benford's Law.

19
00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:19.200
So, back in 1881, Simon Newcomb
determined that the probability that

20
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.410
a number has a first digit, d,
is given by this equation here.

21
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.602
Now, apparently he discovered this
because back then you had to use

22
00:01:27.602 --> 00:01:29.960
books of logarithms to
do complex calculations.

23
00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.938
And he noticed that the pages in the ones
were much more worn than the pages in

24
00:01:34.938 --> 00:01:36.250
the nines.

25
00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.570
So, he got the idea that ones must appear
more often than nines as leading digits,

26
00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.720
and what he found is that they
seem to follow this distribution.

27
00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.520
In 1938,
Frank Benford found a large number of

28
00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.530
naturally occurring data
sets follow this pattern.

29
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.010
So, you find this in the surface area of
rivers, molecular weights, death rates,

30
00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.189
street addresses and the numbers
contained in an issue of Reader's Digest.

31
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.840
So, much like what always happens is
the person that discovers something

32
00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.380
doesn't get the credit,
it's the person that popularizes it.

33
00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.400
So this became known as Benford's Law
instead of Newcomb's Law.

34
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.480
And since then it's been used to find
irregularities in published scientific

35
00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.475
studies, fraudulent election data in Iran,
suspicious macroeconomic data from Greece,

36
00:02:21.475 --> 00:02:24.810
and tax return misreporting.

37
00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.950
So in each of these cases the distribution
of the numbers and what you're looking at

38
00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.970
doesn't meet this equation first
discovered by Simon Newcomb and

39
00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.400
popularized by Frank Benford.

40
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.109
And we're gonna use this
distribution to look for

41
00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:40.506
irregularities in financial statements.

42
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.890
This is, perhaps, the silliest
thing I have ever heard in my life.

43
00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.800
And I am no spring chicken!

44
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.370
>> What could possibly be the explanation
for such an odd law of nature?

45
00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.920
>> So, Benford's Law is what's called
a phenomenological law, which means that

46
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.310
it explains a phenomenon that occurs in
nature, but we have no idea why it occurs.

47
00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.750
In fact, I found a quote where
a leading scientist had said

48
00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.790
it continues to defy attempts
at an easy derivation.

49
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.100
So, if the scientists don't
know a good explanation,

50
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.210
then I certainly can't come up with one.

51
00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.825
But it seems to work in
a lot of unconstrained,

52
00:03:20.825 --> 00:03:23.100
naturally occurring data sets.

53
00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.190
And just because we don't
understand why it happens

54
00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.750
doesn't mean that we can't
use it to our benefit.

55
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:29.370
So, let's go on.

56
00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.350
Here's what the expected distribution of
leading digits is under Benford's Law.

57
00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.830
So you'd expect to see a 1 as
the first digit about 30% of the time.

58
00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.458
Whereas a 9 would be a first
digit only about 5% of the time.

59
00:03:44.458 --> 00:03:49.295
Notice that 0 doesn't appear here, so if
you're working with a decimal number like

60
00:03:49.295 --> 00:03:53.145
0.05, we would consider 5
to be the leading digit.

61
00:03:53.145 --> 00:03:57.660
There's another example to show
how this can detect fraud.

62
00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.960
Here's the distribution of leading
digits from 215 months of returns for

63
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.140
the Fairfield Sentry Fund which was a fund
that invested only with Bernie Madoff.

64
00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.740
And if you haven't heard of Bernie Madoff
maybe you should Google him.

65
00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.340
It's sort of an interesting read.

66
00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.893
But he ran this thing
called a Ponzi scheme,

67
00:04:14.893 --> 00:04:19.658
which was a fraudulent investment fund
where he basically would pay off investors

68
00:04:19.658 --> 00:04:21.880
from new money that he would attract.

69
00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.160
So, as long as he would attract new money,
he could pay back to investors.

70
00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.640
But if the new money ever stopped,
then the Ponzi scheme would collapse.

71
00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.516
Anyway, if you look at the distribution
of the first digit of the returns,

72
00:04:33.516 --> 00:04:37.629
you find that there were way too many
1's in the first digits, not enough 9's.

73
00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:41.537
And so the more you see
a discrepancy from Benford's Law,

74
00:04:41.537 --> 00:04:46.322
the more likely it is you're looking
at numbers that have been made up,

75
00:04:46.322 --> 00:04:50.340
as opposed to represent real
returns earned by a real fund.

76
00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.240
>> Doesn't this just indicate
that Bernie Madoff was not that

77
00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.850
good at committing fraud?

78
00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:02.510
I mean, wouldn't an expert Ponzi
schemer remember to make up returns

79
00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:05.450
that conformed to
the Benford distribution?

80
00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.950
Duh!

81
00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:12.736
>> That raises an excellent point, that
as Benford's Law becomes a more popular

82
00:05:12.736 --> 00:05:17.210
fraud detection technique,
eventually the fraudsters will catch on.

83
00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:20.870
And they will make sure to commit their
frauds in a way where the financial

84
00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:24.710
statement numbers conform to
the Benford Law of Distribution.

85
00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.970
This happens with any kind
of fraud detection tool

86
00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.400
where the more that the fraudsters
know about it, the more they can try

87
00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:36.300
to make their numbers meet
the expected level of the model.

88
00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.150
But nobody's found a way to manipulate all
of the tools that we've looked at in this

89
00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:44.360
course, which means that even though
Benford's Law may work in a lot of cases,

90
00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.740
you don't wanna rely on it exclusively.

91
00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.930
Because the manager can't manipulate their
numbers to make everything look good,

92
00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:53.030
they're gonna trip up somewhere, and

93
00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:54.789
that's why you gotta
look at multiple tools.

94
00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:00.793
The approach that we're gonna use to apply
Benford's Law to financial statements was

95
00:06:00.793 --> 00:06:04.879
laid out in a paper by Dan Amiram,
Zahn Bozanic, and Ethan Rouen in 2014.

96
00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:09.631
What they did was they aggregated all
the financial statement data they could

97
00:06:09.631 --> 00:06:14.060
get by industries, by years,
they looked from 2000 to 2011.

98
00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.840
And that they found that the leading
digits in finance statements

99
00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.280
tend to follow Benford's distribution.

100
00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:23.620
In fact, 83% of firm's financial
statements conform with this distribution.

101
00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:28.406
So when it doesn't conform,
when there's larger discrepancies between

102
00:06:28.406 --> 00:06:31.347
the distribution of numbers in
the financial statement and

103
00:06:31.347 --> 00:06:35.701
the Benford distribution, they also found
larger Modified Jones Model discretionary

104
00:06:35.701 --> 00:06:37.796
accruals and higher Beneish M-Scores.

105
00:06:37.796 --> 00:06:42.703
So the discrepancies did seem to line up
with other tools that we've looked at to

106
00:06:42.703 --> 00:06:44.620
detect earnings management.

107
00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:50.990
So here's how we're gonna calculate
the discrepancy from Benford's Law.

108
00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:53.530
First, we need a large number
of financial statement items.

109
00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:57.504
There's no theory on how many
are needed but more is better.

110
00:06:57.504 --> 00:07:01.713
So one good way to do this is to basically
take all the numbers in the balance sheet,

111
00:07:01.713 --> 00:07:05.480
income statement, cash flow statement and
run this test on them.

112
00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:09.090
It doesn't matter what the numbers are,
it just matters that we get these numbers.

113
00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:12.520
Then we need to count the number
of each leading digit.

114
00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:16.830
So, we can use an Excel formula
where we take the left most digit.

115
00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:19.390
Now, you notice I've got
an absolute value here.

116
00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:22.020
That's because with negative numbers
it would grab the minus sign so

117
00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:23.850
we need to make it positive.

118
00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:27.500
You also need to multiply it by 1,000 or
some large

119
00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:31.905
multiple of 10 before taking the digits,
so that will help you with the decimals.

120
00:07:31.905 --> 00:07:35.650
Cuz we don't want zero as the leading
digit, we want the first non-zero number.

121
00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:39.350
Once we've got all the leading
digits from all the numbers,

122
00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:43.420
we wanna count them up with an Excel
formula to get the amount of, or

123
00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:46.970
the number of leading digits for
each number one through nine.

124
00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:52.460
Then we can compare the actual frequency
of these leading digits to the expected

125
00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:53.950
distribution under Benford's Law.

126
00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:57.180
And we'll test whether it
seems to be different,

127
00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:01.050
using something called
the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic,

128
00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:06.620
not sure how to pronounce that,
which is this sort of ugly formula here.

129
00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:12.010
In this formula, AD is the actual
frequency of the leading digit, so AD is

130
00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:17.630
the actual frequency for 1 is the first
number, AD2 is for 2 is the first number.

131
00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:22.690
ED is the theoretical frequency or what's
expected under the Benford distribution.

132
00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:25.150
And basically, what this statistic
is doing is it's looking for

133
00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:29.840
the biggest point or the biggest
cumulative difference in the distribution.

134
00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:36.080
Then to see if that's statistically
significant, if it's consistent with

135
00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:41.250
earnings management, you wanna see if this
statistic is greater than 1.36 divided

136
00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:45.640
by the square root of P, where P is
the total number of leading digits used.

137
00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:48.670
So, this is something where
the cut off we're gonna use

138
00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:50.489
is a function of the number
of leading digits.

139
00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:58.470
>> Sweetie, y'all can't just give us
the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic and

140
00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:01.950
expect us to know what the lamb
y'all are talking about.

141
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:07.170
>> I completely agree, let's take
a look at an example of how this works.

142
00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:10.620
So, to illustrate how to calculate this,

143
00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:15.265
I've put together a spreadsheet with two
companies Dog Donut and Beagle Bagel,

144
00:09:15.265 --> 00:09:20.370
two leading snack food,
breakfast food companies for dogs.

145
00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:25.630
In the first tab for
Dog Donut I've got three years worth of

146
00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:28.350
their financial statements, balance sheet,
income statement, and cash flow statement.

147
00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:36.042
Then what I need to do is use the formula
to find the leading digit for each number.

148
00:09:36.042 --> 00:09:40.625
So, for 129.30, the leading digit's 1, for

149
00:09:40.625 --> 00:09:43.921
315.46 the leading digit is 3.

150
00:09:43.921 --> 00:09:46.890
One that I want to show you is down here.

151
00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:51.270
There's a number that's 0.51,
we can't have 0 as our leading digit, so

152
00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:54.260
we wanna pull the 5 as the leading digit.

153
00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.740
So we got all the leading digits
from all these numbers and

154
00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:58.700
then we want to count everything up.

155
00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:02.970
So, I've got a formula where I count
up the number of times 1 is the leading

156
00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:06.930
digit, the number of times 2 is
the leading digit, then we add that up.

157
00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:09.800
So, there were a 122 leading digits.

158
00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:13.945
We can divide each count by the percent
to see that in this example,

159
00:10:13.945 --> 00:10:20.220
1's were the leading digit 31% of
the time, 2's 13% of the time and so on.

160
00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:23.760
Then I've got the expected
distribution based on Benford's Law.

161
00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:26.990
And what I calculate is what's
called the cumulative difference.

162
00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:30.480
So, for number one it's simple, it's just
the difference between the actual and

163
00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:33.270
expected distribution for one.

164
00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:37.770
For two, the cumulative differences,
I have to add up the distribution for

165
00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:42.460
one and two, and compare that to the
expected distribution for one and two, and

166
00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:45.000
I find the difference is 2.6%.

167
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.670
For three, I add up 31%, 13.9%, 20.5%,
and compare that to 30.1, 17.6, 12.5 and

168
00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:56.680
they're off by 5 and so forth and so on.

169
00:10:56.680 --> 00:11:02.330
So, the KS statistic is the maximum
the difference which would be 5.4,

170
00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:07.550
the cutoff is this formula of 1.36
divided by the square root of 122,

171
00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:09.430
which is the number of items.

172
00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:13.420
We can see that the KS statistic
is way below the cut off.

173
00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:16.290
So, we have no concerns
in this case that there's

174
00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:19.440
manipulation based on
a deviation from Benford's law.

175
00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:22.290
It conforms to Benford's
law pretty closely.

176
00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:28.090
>> Why do you combine all three
years into one statistic?

177
00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:29.860
Can't you do this for
each individual year?

178
00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:32.900
>> Excellent point.

179
00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:35.480
This is definitely
a technique that works much

180
00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:38.290
better the more numbers that you have.

181
00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:41.490
It doesn't work as well at detecting fraud

182
00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:45.700
if you only have a very small number
of numbers to take a look at.

183
00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:48.100
So, that's why using
three years of numbers,

184
00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:51.040
which is sort of the maximum amount
of numbers you can get in a financial

185
00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:53.690
statement, is gonna be more powerful.

186
00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:56.867
Also, remember we've seen examples
where if you manipulated one year,

187
00:11:56.867 --> 00:11:58.260
it also affects the other year?

188
00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:03.142
So, it's easier to pick up frauds
if you find these deviations across

189
00:12:03.142 --> 00:12:06.130
both years as opposed to one unusual year.

190
00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:08.824
And definitely if you dig
through this example,

191
00:12:08.824 --> 00:12:13.700
it's a case where you wouldn't clearly
find fraud looking at individual years.

192
00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:17.504
But looking at all three years together,
it does seem like these were

193
00:12:17.504 --> 00:12:21.586
artificially generated numbers
consistent with earnings management.

194
00:12:21.586 --> 00:12:24.630
Now, we can do the same thing for
Beagle Bagel.

195
00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:27.400
So, we put in all the financial
statement numbers we can find for

196
00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:32.370
the last three years,
calculate all the leading digits,

197
00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:35.800
then count up the number of each
of the leading digits to get

198
00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:40.400
the actual distribution compared
to the expected distribution.

199
00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:43.405
And we end up with a KS
statistic of 16.2%,

200
00:12:43.405 --> 00:12:47.850
that's based on the cumulative difference
between the number of one, twos, and

201
00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:51.730
threes, actually versus what
the Benford Law would say.

202
00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:56.070
That 16.2% is greater
than our cutoff of 12.3%.

203
00:12:56.070 --> 00:13:00.596
So, in this case we would be suspicious
that there was manipulation going on

204
00:13:00.596 --> 00:13:03.143
with Beagle Bagel because their financial

205
00:13:03.143 --> 00:13:06.337
statements don't meet this
Benford distribution.

206
00:13:06.337 --> 00:13:09.256
And we looked at one of their close
competitors where their financial

207
00:13:09.256 --> 00:13:10.370
statement does beat it.

208
00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:15.090
So we can attribute this to some
kind of industry effect, instead it

209
00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:18.280
looks like they may have done somethings
to manipulate there financial statements.

210
00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:25.100
>> Professor, I want to enthusiastically
and sincerely thank you for

211
00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:29.840
giving us 359 tools for
analyzing financial statements.

212
00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:32.940
Now, I have just one
more small favor to ask.

213
00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:34.580
Which doggone tool should I use?

214
00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:38.260
>> You're welcome,
I've been happy to do this.

215
00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:43.020
And I will ignore the sarcasm
in saying 359 tools.

216
00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:44.850
So which ones should you use?

217
00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:46.547
Well, you should use all of them.

218
00:13:46.547 --> 00:13:51.004
[LAUGH] So one thing that I hoped has
definitely come across in these videos,

219
00:13:51.004 --> 00:13:56.235
is that there is no one tool that will
pick up all forms of earnings management.

220
00:13:56.235 --> 00:13:59.755
If there was one tool that always worked,
I certainly wouldn't tell you about it.

221
00:13:59.755 --> 00:14:02.025
I would keep it to myself and get rich so

222
00:14:02.025 --> 00:14:03.695
I wouldn't have to sit
here making these videos.

223
00:14:04.755 --> 00:14:07.955
Also, as we talked about it earlier,
if there was one tool that

224
00:14:07.955 --> 00:14:11.530
always seem to work,
the fraudsters would find out about it and

225
00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:15.140
do their manipulation in a way
that the tool wouldn't pick it up.

226
00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:19.240
So that's why you need to look at a big
range of tools to find these kinds of

227
00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:20.300
problems.

228
00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:22.878
The big data approaches of this
week are good starting points.

229
00:14:22.878 --> 00:14:26.123
So if you've got a large number
of companies to look at,

230
00:14:26.123 --> 00:14:29.506
you run the Benford's test or
the fraud prediction test,

231
00:14:29.506 --> 00:14:32.405
figure out which five or
six look suspicious, and

232
00:14:32.405 --> 00:14:37.280
then dive in deeper to look at the other
tools to see if there's a problem.

233
00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:41.180
Because one thing I'm pretty sure about
is that the more tools that suggest

234
00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:42.610
there's manipulation,

235
00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:46.149
the more likely it is that you've found a
company that's manipulated their earnings.

236
00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:52.680
That wraps our look at Benford's Law and
it also wraps our week

237
00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:57.350
on big data approaches to try to
detect earnings management or fraud.

238
00:14:57.350 --> 00:15:01.046
I hope some of these tools come in
handy for you in the future and

239
00:15:01.046 --> 00:15:04.700
help you identify some firms that
may have fishy financial statements,

240
00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:08.440
so that you can stay as far
away from them as possible.

241
00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:13.213
And I really hope that you
enjoyed all this material and

242
00:15:13.213 --> 00:15:16.130
I want to thank you for watching.

243
00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:17.840
>> See you next video.
