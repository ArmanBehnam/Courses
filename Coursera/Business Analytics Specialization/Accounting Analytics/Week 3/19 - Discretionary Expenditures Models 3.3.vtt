00:00:03.191 --> 00:00:06.220
Hello, I'm Professor Brian Bushee,
welcome back.

2
00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:10.020
In this video, we're gonna take a look
at models of discretionary expenditures.

3
00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.260
Managers can also manipulate
their earnings by

4
00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.490
changing their cash expenditures
on things like research and

5
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.570
development, advertising,
training costs, and so forth.

6
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.500
That's because the cash spending for those
kind of costs are expensed immediately

7
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.130
which means if you delay some research and
development spending from this year to

8
00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.180
next year you also shift the expense
from this year to next year.

9
00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.800
There by making your earnings look better.

10
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.240
We're gonna use the same approaches
with discretionary accruals,

11
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.390
where we're gonna use regression
techniques to model the normal

12
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.160
level of these expenditures, then look for

13
00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.310
differences from these normal levels as
potential evidence of earnings management.

14
00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:51.070
Let's get started.

15
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.440
So if you recall, when we talked
about discretionary accruals,

16
00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.790
we divided net income into cash
earnings plus non-cash earnings.

17
00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.132
And discretionary accruals were the way
to manipulate non cash earnings.

18
00:01:05.132 --> 00:01:09.780
While discretionary expenditures
are the way to manipulate cash earnings.

19
00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.780
So, managers can manipulate
cash earnings by delaying or

20
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.070
accelerating real expenditures.

21
00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.630
Especially those that have to be expensed
immediately according to the rules.

22
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.610
In other words,
they can't be capitalized and amortized.

23
00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.950
So this would include things like
research and development expense,

24
00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.680
advertising expense, and selling general,
and administrative expense which includes

25
00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.270
things like maintenance on machines,
employee training, employee travel.

26
00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.090
And for some companies also includes
the R&D and advertising expense.

27
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.970
This real earnings management does
not violate any securities laws.

28
00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.530
Because managers are not playing with the
rules, they're not playing with estimates,

29
00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.930
they're just changing the timing
of when they spend cash.

30
00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.410
And there's no rule that says
when you have to spend cash.

31
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.170
And as such,

32
00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.940
it's viewed by managers as a much more
ethical form of earnings management.

33
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.220
The drawback is it has to be done well
in advance of the end of the period.

34
00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.070
So, accruals, because you're playing
with assumptions, or estimates,

35
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.050
you can change those on
the last day of the period.

36
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.180
But for real earnings management
you have to start delaying or

37
00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.190
accelerating cash payments well before you
get to the end of the period, so there has

38
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.419
to be some advance knowledge that your
earnings are gonna be in trouble.

39
00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.500
Real Earnings Management is much
harder for outsiders to detect

40
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.540
because we always have the concern that
managers may have a legitimate reason to

41
00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.960
delay expenditures due to their
poor performance during the period.

42
00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:39.280
>> Yipee.

43
00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.880
I was really hoping we would talk
about ethical earnings management.

44
00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.950
It is an open secret that my least
favorite form of speech is an oxymoron.

45
00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.150
>> Yes.
Ethical earnings management

46
00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.480
is an oxymoron, but
there's been a lot of survey evidence

47
00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.780
that finds that managers view this kind
of earnings management as not unethical.

48
00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.590
They find it as legitimate.

49
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.550
And that's because they're going through
the following logic in their head.

50
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.710
It looks like our performance this
period is gonna be below expectations,

51
00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.300
which means times are tough,
we're not performing as well.

52
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.440
We need to scale back on some of our
cash costs so why don't we reduce or

53
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.510
delay some of our RND or advertising?

54
00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.580
Or SG and
A from this period into next period.

55
00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.800
And again that could be legitimate
because if things are not going

56
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.470
well at the company, maybe you do
wanna cut some of these costs.

57
00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.250
But the timing of when these are done and

58
00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.340
the amount that these things are reduced
all suggest that they're doing it

59
00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.580
really to try to make their earnings
look better and meet an earnings target.

60
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.810
So one of the things we'll
work on in this video and

61
00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.470
next video is to try to disentangle
legitimate cuts in these expenditures

62
00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:48.020
because the company is really performing
poorly, from cuts that managers may say

63
00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:52.270
are legitimate, but really are intended
to make their earnings look better.

64
00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.960
So now let's talk about the model
that we're going to use to try to

65
00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.090
estimate discretionary expenditures.

66
00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.310
So the normal level of these expenditures
should be a function of last year's

67
00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:09.960
expenditures, as well as the company's
revenue and its growth in the business.

68
00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.680
So we're gonna model
changes in expenditures.

69
00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.750
So we'll take the current
year minus last year.

70
00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.510
So for research and development,
we would take this year's R&D expense

71
00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.910
minus last year's R&D expense to
recognize the fact that last year's

72
00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.360
expenditures have a big determination
on what you're gonna spend this year.

73
00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.240
We're gonna use prior years' revenue
growth for the growth in the business and

74
00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.170
then prior year's revenue.

75
00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.130
We wanna use the prior year because
normal expenditures are often

76
00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:39.750
budgeted based on prior year's results.

77
00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.150
So after you see the results for one year

78
00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.020
then you budget what you're gonna spend
for these expenditures the next year so

79
00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.630
that determines the normal
level of expenditures.

80
00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.090
Also using the prior year insures
that the model is not affected by

81
00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:58.010
current year sales manipulation so
if we used revenue in the same year.

82
00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.550
Maybe managers are trying
to manipulate sales

83
00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.190
as they try to manipulate
these real expenditures.

84
00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.280
And just like the Discretion Accruals
model everything will be deflated by prior

85
00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.020
total assets to take out the size effect.

86
00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:14.466
So the model is gonna be that the change
in expenditures is gonna be a function of

87
00:05:14.466 --> 00:05:16.370
the prior sales growth and
the prior sales.

88
00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:20.711
For expenditures we'll use either
SG&A expense, R&D expense or

89
00:05:20.711 --> 00:05:22.242
advertising expense.

90
00:05:22.242 --> 00:05:26.477
We'll do separate models for all three and
you'll want to look at all three because

91
00:05:26.477 --> 00:05:29.940
you don't know X and T which one
the company might be manipulating.

92
00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:34.656
We're gonna run industry year regressions
to get the estimated A B and C parameters,

93
00:05:34.656 --> 00:05:38.865
so we're not gonna fool around with
the time series stuff with the old firm.

94
00:05:38.865 --> 00:05:43.441
We're just gonna do
the regression within industry.

95
00:05:43.441 --> 00:05:46.595
Once we get the parameters then we
can calculate the normal change in

96
00:05:46.595 --> 00:05:51.165
the expenditure as the intercept A,
plus the coefficient B

97
00:05:51.165 --> 00:05:54.349
times prior sales growth,
plus the coefficient C times prior sales.

98
00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:58.970
Then discretionary expenditures will
be the total change in the expense

99
00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:02.210
minus the normal change in
the expense based on this equation.

100
00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:08.930
And again we'll do it separately for
SG&A, R&D, and Advertising.

101
00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:10.950
>> What a complexly simple model.

102
00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:16.100
I love the redundant originality of your
use of both sales and change in sales.

103
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.450
You are a vapid inspiration to us all.

104
00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:24.770
>> I see what you did there by putting
in some more oxymorons in your question.

105
00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:27.380
Yes, this is a very simple model.

106
00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:31.140
Academic research has tried to
do more complicated models,

107
00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:34.420
they've tried different models for
different types of expenditures.

108
00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:38.520
But the added explanatory power in
doing so was just not that great.

109
00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:42.370
So I decided to just keep the model
simple in this case because they work

110
00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:45.620
pretty much as well as
the more complicated models.

111
00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:50.290
So, instead of adding complexity for
a tiny bit of extra explanatory power, I

112
00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:54.329
wanted to keep it simple, and these models
will be good enough for our purposes.

113
00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:58.520
So let's go to the spreadsheet for

114
00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:04.140
Arfabark company where we'll look at
an example of how to calculate the model.

115
00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:10.470
We'll again focus on 2009 as a potential
year that they might have manipulated.

116
00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:14.970
I pulled in probably way more years of
data than I need because we're not gonna

117
00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:18.760
do a time serious model, but at least
you need some prior data to look for

118
00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:19.860
time trends.

119
00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:24.440
The first few columns are all the raw
data that I need to calculate the model.

120
00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:27.590
The purple columns are the variables
that go into the model.

121
00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:31.690
The orangeish columns
are the intercept and

122
00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:36.390
coefficient parameters that are estimated
from industry year regressions.

123
00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:37.870
That's why they change every year.

124
00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:42.370
And so I will also give you a spreadsheet
where you can pull in these parameters for

125
00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:44.670
the industry and a given year.

126
00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:47.900
So then you can use these
estimated parameters and

127
00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:50.310
the variables to come up with normal R&D.

128
00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:55.530
Take the total R&D minus
the Normal R&D to come up

129
00:07:55.530 --> 00:08:01.200
with the Discretionary R&D and if we
look in 2009 there's a small negative.

130
00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:06.130
2010 there's a small positive but
these are within the realm of,

131
00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:10.400
sort of, normal, bouncing around and
discretionary R&D.

132
00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:13.950
So I think we would conclude from
this that there's no evidence of

133
00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:18.880
manipulation using R&D in 2009 or
2010 which is not

134
00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:23.360
a surprise cuz we didn't really
expect there to be strong incentives.

135
00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:26.620
So to see if the model works
let's do a manipulation.

136
00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:31.150
So in 2009 I drastically cut R&D.

137
00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:36.536
And if we look at the discretionary R&D
number it becomes much larger negative.

138
00:08:36.536 --> 00:08:39.601
So it's -0 .019.

139
00:08:39.601 --> 00:08:44.180
Now remember, if you want to manipulate
earnings upward with a discretion

140
00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:49.700
expenditure, you need to cut it, right,
cut the expense to make earning higher.

141
00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:53.280
So negative discretion
RD would be indication

142
00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:55.790
of trying to make earnings go higher.

143
00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:58.860
And notice in the next year
we get a big positive.

144
00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:01.120
That's because if you cut R&D in one year,
and

145
00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:03.430
then don't manipulate in the next year.

146
00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:07.310
It will automatically swing up to a big
positive because the model is based on

147
00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:09.120
this change in R&D.

148
00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:12.413
So it does look like the model
picks up a cut in R&D in this case.

149
00:09:16.412 --> 00:09:20.100
>> Looks like a bluntly sharp model to me.

150
00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:23.310
Wouldn't the deceptively
obvious huge decline in R&D

151
00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:24.970
suggest that there was a problem?

152
00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:29.800
>> Yes, in this simple example,
the R&D cut is pretty huge and

153
00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:32.200
it should raise some suspicion.

154
00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:37.050
But keep in mind that a cut in R&D alone
is not evidence of earnings management.

155
00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:41.470
We have the model because the cut in R&D
could be expected based on change in

156
00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:42.830
business conditions.

157
00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:45.540
The model helps us find
those situations so

158
00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:49.310
that we can find cut in
R&D that is not explained

159
00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:54.220
by changes in business situations and
is more likely to reflect manipulation.

160
00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:58.830
What we'll do in the next video is we'll
bring in some quarterly changes in R&D

161
00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:02.380
as additional evidence to try
to help us spot manipulations.

162
00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:05.070
But a cut in R&D alone
is not enough evidence,

163
00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:08.230
because it could be expected
based on changes in the business.

164
00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:14.045
In this spreadsheet I also did
discretionary expenditure models for

165
00:10:14.045 --> 00:10:19.520
SG&A and I'll let you look through
this on your own at your leisure.

166
00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:22.350
But you can see I put
in a manipulation and

167
00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:27.270
we do see an increase in discretionary
SG&A an increasing negative number

168
00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:30.790
which would indicate they cut SG&A
to make their earnings higher.

169
00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:33.200
And then I do it for advertising.

170
00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:36.470
We see again the effect of a manipulation,

171
00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:41.020
advertising shows up in the discretionary
advertising number, but in this case it's

172
00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:47.130
really small magnitude because advertising
is not a huge expense for Arfabark.

173
00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:51.280
In general, you'd wanna use
the discretionary expenditure model for

174
00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:53.280
the expenditure that's a big deal for
the company.

175
00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:56.840
So if it's a big R&D company,
you want to focus on R&D first.

176
00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:00.060
If it has huge advertising
then it might make sense

177
00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:03.750
to focus on discretionary advertising but
if they don't have a lot of advertising

178
00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:08.100
it's probably not the tool that's used for
manipulation anyway.

179
00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:13.750
So hopefully that gives you a good sense
on how to estimate these discretion

180
00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:19.260
expenditure models for R&D, advertising,
selling general administrative expense.

181
00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:24.200
In the next video we're gonna do a couple
refinements to these models, and

182
00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:29.920
then look at three cases to see how well
they work in detecting earning management.

183
00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:30.510
I'll see you then!

184
00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:32.930
>> See you next video!
