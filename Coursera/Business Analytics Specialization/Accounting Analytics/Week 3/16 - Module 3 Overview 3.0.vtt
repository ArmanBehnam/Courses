00:00:03.786 --> 00:00:05.740
Hello, I'm Professor Brian Bushee.

2
00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:10.730
Welcome to week three of my part of
the Accounting Analytics course.

3
00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.790
This week is gonna be our big
data week where we're gonna

4
00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.700
use some of these big data approaches
to try to detect earnings management,

5
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.430
building on what we looked at last week.

6
00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.970
By big data, I mean we're gonna use
prediction models to try to predict how

7
00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.958
the financial statements would look if
there was no manipulation by the manager.

8
00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:35.467
Which means that any deviations from this
expected level we do see are likely to be

9
00:00:35.467 --> 00:00:40.460
consistent with earnings management or the
manipulation of the financial statements.

10
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.089
To do this, we're gonna use
a lot of regression models.

11
00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:47.690
Now, I know a lot of you
haven't seen regression before.

12
00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:48.870
That's okay.

13
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.410
I'm gonna tell you everything you need
to know to be able to do these models.

14
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.293
I'll give you all the resources you need.

15
00:00:54.293 --> 00:00:58.979
And I'll just, right now, give you a sense
for what these regressions represent.

16
00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.220
So basically, a regression is a way
to see how one set of variables

17
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.670
helps to explain changes
in another variable.

18
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.690
For instance, if I wanted to know how
much extra salary I would earn in my job

19
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.370
if I did more education, I could do a
regression model and what it would give me

20
00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:23.580
is an estimate of how much my salary would
go up if I did one more year of education.

21
00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.180
So, that's the kind of prediction
approach we're gonna use

22
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.140
to try to detect earnings
management this week.

23
00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.730
We're gonna start by looking at what
are called Discretionary Accruals Models.

24
00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:38.630
These models try to model
the non-cash portion of earnings or

25
00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:44.320
accruals, where managers are making
estimates on revenues or expenses.

26
00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.753
We'll first do a video on
estimating the models.

27
00:01:47.753 --> 00:01:52.110
Then we'll do a video where you apply
the models to some case studies.

28
00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.160
Next, we'll talk about
Discretionary Expenditure Models.

29
00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.160
These models try to model
the cash portion of earnings.

30
00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.091
These are expenditures on things like
research and development, or advertising.

31
00:02:03.091 --> 00:02:06.900
Again, we'll start with a video
on how to estimate the models.

32
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.980
Then we'll look at some
refinements to the models and

33
00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:10.580
apply them to some case studies.

34
00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.329
Then we'll look at
Fraud Prediction Models.

35
00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:19.208
These models try to directly predict what
types of companies are likely to commit

36
00:02:19.208 --> 00:02:19.790
frauds.

37
00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.050
Then in the last video,

38
00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:27.080
we'll look at something called Benford's
Law, which is a little bit off the wall.

39
00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.290
But what it's gonna do is it's
gonna look at the frequency with

40
00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.650
which certain numbers appear.

41
00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.210
And if certain numbers
appear more often or

42
00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:40.140
less often than dictated by Benford's Law,
it's gonna be an indication

43
00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.319
that the financial statements
were potentially manipulated.

44
00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.526
So, these models represent
the state of the art right now.

45
00:02:47.526 --> 00:02:53.620
These are what academics use to try to
detect and predict earnings management.

46
00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.876
A lot of these models are not easy.

47
00:02:55.876 --> 00:02:59.260
I'm gonna try to make
them very user friendly.

48
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.160
Because by learning this models,

49
00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.980
you'll come out of this week with a very
strong tool kit that will help you try to

50
00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:12.750
detect financial statements that may
have been manipulated by managers.

51
00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.019
So, let's get to it.
