00:00:03.406 --> 00:00:04.870
Hello, I'm professor Brian Bushee.

2
00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:06.010
Welcome back.

3
00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:08.930
In this video, we're going to take
a look at a fraud prediction model.

4
00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:11.960
So this is going to be a very different
approach from what we've been looking

5
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.320
at so far.

6
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.040
So far we've been trying to look at
individual line items, like revenues or

7
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.550
expenses, or components of earnings
like accrual, or cash earnings,

8
00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:27.160
to try to see whether they look different
or unusual based on what we would expect.

9
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.074
The approach today is let's just look at
firms that have committed fraud, look at

10
00:00:30.074 --> 00:00:33.133
some firms that didn't commit fraud, and
try to figure out how they're different.

11
00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:36.750
So, throw in as many ratios
as we can think about and

12
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.719
use statistical techniques to see
which ratios best explain what firm

13
00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:47.310
ends up being a fraud firm versus what
firm ends up being not a fraud firm.

14
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:51.140
So it's a different approach to coming up
with detecting earnings management and

15
00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.590
let's see how it works.

16
00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:53.220
Let's get started.

17
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.480
In general, the goal of fraud prediction
models is to examine companies that have

18
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.350
been caught committing fraud, to try to
model how they differ from companies that

19
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.530
are not caught committing fraud.

20
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.720
And they'll use various statistical
techniques to try to choose a small set

21
00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.010
of variables or ratios that provide
the best explanatory power,

22
00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.750
do the best job of identifying the fraud
firms versus the not fraud firms.

23
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.840
The advantage of this approach is they're
specifically tailored to characteristics

24
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:24.570
of fraud firms.

25
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.560
So we look at who we
actually know is guilty

26
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.800
to see how they differ
from other companies.

27
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.960
And the model parameters are fixed,

28
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.250
which means they don't have to be
re-estimated for each company.

29
00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.250
So forget the time series and
cross-sectional industry approaches.

30
00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.840
There's one set of model parameters that
are used for every company in every year.

31
00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.890
Disadvantages, the models are based on
companies that were actually caught

32
00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.440
committing huge frauds,

33
00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.930
which means it's gonna tend towards more
extreme forms of earnings management, and

34
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.580
it may not pick up more subtle
forms of earnings management.

35
00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.189
And the models return a large
number of false positives.

36
00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:05.660
>> False positive?

37
00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.550
What the diva are you talking about?

38
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.510
>> Excellent question, so

39
00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:15.780
a positive result would be where
the measure indicates something's a fraud,

40
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.800
a negative result would be where
the measure indicates it's not a fraud.

41
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.280
So a false positive would be where
the measure says it's a fraud, but

42
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.480
it's really not.

43
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.750
A false negative would be where
the measure says it's not a fraud, but

44
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.020
it really is.

45
00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.670
So any kind of model is gonna trade off
these false positives and false negatives.

46
00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.570
And in these models tend to try
to reduce the false negatives,

47
00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.570
try to reduce the situations where
the models say it's not a fraud but

48
00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.300
it actually is, because you
really wanna detect these frauds.

49
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.060
But the cost is that you're gonna
detect more companies as frauds that

50
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.410
really aren't.

51
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.130
But I guess better safe than sorry.

52
00:02:52.732 --> 00:02:55.490
We're gonna just focus on
one of these models and

53
00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.100
the model is the Beneish M-score,

54
00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.200
which has been found to have preformed
the best over the last 20 years.

55
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.620
It was developed by
Danielle Beneish in 1999 and

56
00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.198
successfully flagged 12 of 17 high
profile frauds since that point.

57
00:03:11.198 --> 00:03:15.348
The Beneish M-Score is
based on eight ratios.

58
00:03:15.348 --> 00:03:19.420
A higher M-Score means higher
likelihood of manipulation.

59
00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.100
So it's called M-Score because
of the manipulation score.

60
00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.200
And the ratios we're gonna look at use
comparisons between the current year and

61
00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.660
the prior year.

62
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.728
So the first ratio is days
sales receivable index or DSRI.

63
00:03:32.728 --> 00:03:36.760
This is gonna be days receivable divided
by prior days receivable, where days

64
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.720
receivable is defined a little bit
differently than we did it in the past.

65
00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.550
It's receivables divided
by sales times 365.

66
00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.970
An increase in this could
suggest revenue manipulation.

67
00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:52.070
The Gross Margin Index, or GMI, is prior
gross margin divided by gross margin,

68
00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:55.719
where gross margin again is sales minus
cost of good sold divided by sales.

69
00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.880
This is gonna flag deteriorating
earnings prospects,

70
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.850
which may create an incentive to
manipulate earnings during a period.

71
00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:07.490
Next is an asset quality index, AQI.

72
00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:10.610
This is asset quality divided
by prior asset quality,

73
00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:15.100
where asset quality is total assets minus
the sum of current assets and PP&E,

74
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.320
all divided by total assets.

75
00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.380
This is intended to measure soft assets or
intangible assets, for

76
00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.010
which the realization of
benefits is uncertain.

77
00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.450
For example, they could suggest
excessive capitalization of costs,

78
00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.420
as we saw in the expense
recognition videos.

79
00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.880
Sales growth index, or SGI,
is gonna be sales over prior sales.

80
00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.370
So growth companies often face
pressure to meet earnings targets and

81
00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.940
have high capital needs, providing higher
incentives to manipulate earnings.

82
00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.070
The Depreciation Index,

83
00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:51.890
or DEPI, is gonna be prior depreciation
rate over current depreciation rate,

84
00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:56.850
where depreciation rate is depreciation
divided by depreciation plus PP&E.

85
00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:00.690
A ratio greater than one could indicate
the depreciation rate has slowed,

86
00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.970
which could reflect income increasing
depreciation policy changes.

87
00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:08.040
>> Zut Alors!

88
00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.160
Could you make this any more boring?

89
00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.320
At least this is named for
another citoyen francais!

90
00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:19.470
>> Yeah, I'm sorry I can't crunch through
these eight ratios in a more exciting

91
00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.650
fashion, but
at least we only have three more to go.

92
00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:25.770
And by the way,
although Daniel Beneish does speak French,

93
00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.410
I think he's a Canadian citizen and
not a French citizen.

94
00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.624
Next we have the SG&A index, or SGAI.

95
00:05:33.624 --> 00:05:38.118
This is the SG&A ratio divided
by prior SG&A ratio where

96
00:05:38.118 --> 00:05:41.690
the SG&A ratio is SG&A expense over sales.

97
00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:45.860
This would indicate
decreasing SG&A efficiency,

98
00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.810
which may predispose companies
to manipulate earnings.

99
00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.920
We have total accrual to total assets,
the TATA ratio.

100
00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.870
This is a accruals
divided by total assets,

101
00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:58.180
where accruals are defined similar
to what we've done before.

102
00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:02.180
It's net income before extraordinary
items, minus cash from operations.

103
00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.550
This is the proxy for non-cash earnings,

104
00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:08.740
which as we've seen are easier to
manipulate than cash earnings.

105
00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:14.160
Then there's a leverage index, LVGI, which
is leverage divided by prior leverage,

106
00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:18.940
where leverage is long term debt plus
liabilities, all divided by total assets.

107
00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:22.910
This captures incentives
to avoid debt covenants.

108
00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:27.420
If you're highly levered, you have more
incentives to manipulate your earnings to

109
00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:30.636
avoid violating debt covenants and
becoming in default.

110
00:06:30.636 --> 00:06:35.340
So the M-Score is going
to be an intercept,

111
00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:40.390
plus the sum of all of the weights on the
variables, times the variables themselves.

112
00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:44.110
Where in this case the weights are gonna
be the same for all companies, and

113
00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:46.540
here are the weights that we're
gonna use for each of the variables.

114
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.870
>> Dude,
like what do you mean by variable?

115
00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:55.250
And dude, it is like not cool to
talk about a company's weight.

116
00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:00.860
>> In this case,
weight actually refers to a coefficient or

117
00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:04.800
parameter estimate, not to
the actual heaviness of the company.

118
00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:08.750
So although the terminology's different,
it's exactly the same approach as we did

119
00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:11.800
with discretionary accruals and
discretionary expenditures.

120
00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:15.720
To get the normal levels of accruals or
normal levels of expenditures,

121
00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:19.640
we took an intercept, and
then we took the estimate b and

122
00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:23.650
c parameters, times the value
of the variable for the company.

123
00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:28.720
In this case, the variables are just
the values of the ratios for each company.

124
00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:31.670
And what I'll do now is I'll go through
an example of how to put together

125
00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:32.505
this M-score.

126
00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:38.930
So as an example, let's bring in
the value of all these variables for

127
00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:41.460
company X in the year 2015.

128
00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:43.865
So, I've filled that in this column.

129
00:07:43.865 --> 00:07:48.998
One not at the bottom is sometimes it's
hard to get data to calculate SGAI,

130
00:07:48.998 --> 00:07:51.910
AQI, or DEPI.

131
00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:55.010
So if you can't do that, Beneish has
found that you can just set them equal to

132
00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:58.120
one and
the model would still work pretty well.

133
00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:02.110
So now that we have the variables, we can
take the weight times the variable, so

134
00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:04.140
the intercept will just carry over.

135
00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:08.876
But then for DSRI, we would take the
weight on that times the value of DSRI for

136
00:08:08.876 --> 00:08:10.579
this company in 2015.

137
00:08:10.579 --> 00:08:15.350
To get the product of the weight and the
variable, we add up this last column and

138
00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:18.041
we get an M-Score of negative 0.442.

139
00:08:18.041 --> 00:08:24.388
And what Beneish has found, is that
an M-Score that's greater than -1.78

140
00:08:24.388 --> 00:08:30.660
is a red flag that indicates a potential
manipulator, a potential fraud firm.

141
00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:37.155
>> Dude,
where did y'all come up with -1.78?

142
00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:44.434
>> So the -1.78 was chosen to try to
balance off these false positives and

143
00:08:44.434 --> 00:08:45.855
false negatives.

144
00:08:45.855 --> 00:08:50.308
So it was the point in the original
research where Daniel Beneish

145
00:08:50.308 --> 00:08:54.678
found that you got an acceptable
small level of false negatives

146
00:08:54.678 --> 00:08:57.749
without getting too many false positives.

147
00:08:57.749 --> 00:09:00.991
Now, probably could have
rescaled the score so

148
00:09:00.991 --> 00:09:06.511
that it was zero instead of -1.78,
but hey we're accounting professors.

149
00:09:06.511 --> 00:09:09.020
Accounting professors are sort of geeky.

150
00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:13.070
And so we like things where the cut
off is minus 1.78 as opposed

151
00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:15.440
to something more user friendly like zero.

152
00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:21.430
Let's take a look at how to
calculate the M-Score for a company.

153
00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:23.211
The case we're gonna do is Dogron.

154
00:09:23.211 --> 00:09:30.313
Dogron is one of the world's major
electricity, natural gas, commodities,

155
00:09:30.313 --> 00:09:35.509
communications, and pulp and
paper companies for dogs.

156
00:09:35.509 --> 00:09:36.089
>> Really?

157
00:09:36.089 --> 00:09:36.647
Dogron?

158
00:09:36.647 --> 00:09:37.389
Really?

159
00:09:37.389 --> 00:09:38.109
Dogron?

160
00:09:38.109 --> 00:09:38.770
Really?

161
00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:44.430
>> Yeah, so
this one is a little hard to disguise.

162
00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:47.220
Dogron is really Enron.

163
00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:48.220
Enron, of course,

164
00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:52.960
was one of the biggest financial reporting
scandals of the last 50 years or so.

165
00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:56.070
Huge financial statement fraud,

166
00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:59.700
resulting in the biggest bankruptcy
in US history at the time.

167
00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:03.540
I guess since the company
has gone bankrupt,

168
00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:08.100
there probably are not any company lawyers
that are still around to sue me for

169
00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:10.490
saying bad things about the company.

170
00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:14.140
So why don't we go ahead and just
admit this is Enron and call it Enron.

171
00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:20.480
So anyway, Enron was one of the world's
major electricity, natural gas,

172
00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:24.310
commodities, communications,
and pulp and paper companies.

173
00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:26.260
In October of 2001,

174
00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:30.760
Enron was found to have committed fraud in
the reporting of its financial statements.

175
00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:33.280
It used Special Purpose Entities,
Mark-to-Market Accounting and

176
00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:36.460
other tricks to manipulate
its financial statements.

177
00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:40.180
Ended up declaring bankruptcy within
one month of the news of the fraud, so

178
00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:42.390
it collapsed very quickly.

179
00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:44.120
And it's auditor, Arthur Andersen,

180
00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:47.980
was forced to close after
an obstruction of justice charge.

181
00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:52.180
Andersen was one of the big five auditors,
long history,

182
00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:55.619
this scandal brought the company down,
and they went out of business.

183
00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:00.680
So let's see, how does the M-score
work for a company like Enron,

184
00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:02.790
that we know ended up
committing a big fraud?

185
00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:08.530
So here is the spreadsheet for

186
00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:13.340
Enron, where I've pulled in all the raw
data I need to calculate these ratios and

187
00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:15.349
you can see that it's a lot
of raw data that you need.

188
00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:23.350
The columns in purple are the ratios
that go into the M-score.

189
00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:26.509
Then, what I do is I have an M-score
column where I have the formula built in.

190
00:11:26.509 --> 00:11:31.450
So if we zoom in on the formula,
you can see I've got the intercept,

191
00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:36.066
plus the weights times the cell
where we calculate each ratio.

192
00:11:36.066 --> 00:11:39.986
And because the weights are the same for
every firm and ever year,

193
00:11:39.986 --> 00:11:45.540
we can just leave this formula and put
any company in there and it should work.

194
00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:50.950
So what we see is in 2000,
the year before the fraud got revealed,

195
00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:54.600
there was this -0.44 M-score.

196
00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:59.060
Now remember an M-score where
the number is less than -1.78 is

197
00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:02.958
indication that it's not a fraud.

198
00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:09.140
If the M-score is greater than -1.78,
then it is a potential fraud.

199
00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:12.960
So in this case it would have
flagged Enron as a potential fraud.

200
00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:17.510
Now what you'd have to do though is you'd
have to check their earnings measure

201
00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:20.950
incentives, benchmark against competitors.

202
00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:25.000
Even so, remember these models have
a lot of false positives, so if you saw

203
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.550
something like this, then you might wanna
go and look at some of the revenue and

204
00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:31.270
expense ratios we've talked about,
discretionary accruals,

205
00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:35.530
discretion expenditures,
to see if you can find more evidence.

206
00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:41.030
So this is a good first step to red-flag a
company where there's potential concerns.

207
00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:44.330
But you're gonna wanna gather a lot
of other measures before you have

208
00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:46.921
confidence that you really
have picked up a fraud.

209
00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:53.860
So that wraps up our look at the
Beneish M-score fraud prediction model.

210
00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:56.140
As you can tell,
I'm a bit skeptical about it.

211
00:12:56.140 --> 00:13:01.090
Anything that's really easy to implement
is also gonna be not that powerful

212
00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:03.890
as the more complicated models are.

213
00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:06.710
It certainly detected fraud for
Enron very well,

214
00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:09.770
but then again [LAUGH] any fraud
prediction model better detect fraud for

215
00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:12.660
Enron, otherwise it will
never get published.

216
00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:13.790
I do think it's a good,

217
00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:17.630
easy first step to identify firms
that you should be suspicious in,

218
00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:22.720
and then you can dig in further with other
of these tools that we've talked about.

219
00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:24.950
But another tool for your tool kit.

220
00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:26.540
We've got one more to add.

221
00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:28.266
And I will see you next video.

222
00:13:30.849 --> 00:13:31.881
>> See you next video.
