1
00:00:05.051 --> 00:00:07.872
Let's go through some comprehensive
examples of how to link

2
00:00:07.872 --> 00:00:10.930
these non-financial metrics
to financial performance.

3
00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.070
So here's another example,
we've got an advertising firm.

4
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.500
Okay, what happens as advertising firm is
they have lots of local advertisements.

5
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.280
This would be like the Yellow Pages,

6
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.920
the local advertisement book
with the phone numbers.

7
00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.110
So you can have it in various
places in Philadelphia.

8
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.890
It could be South Philadelphia or
Center City Philadelphia, it could be

9
00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.070
each one of the little suburbs around
Philadelphia has their own advertisements.

10
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.330
So what company could decide I'm going to
advertise in all the local locations,

11
00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.930
they can say I'm advertising
only the big ones on this?

12
00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:40.958
So that's the setting here.

13
00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:44.020
Now again, their hypothesis which
is with the business model this is,

14
00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.177
more satisfied customers
buy more in the future.

15
00:00:46.177 --> 00:00:48.710
Now this could come
through a lot of things.

16
00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.370
We're going to buy more
of the same service so

17
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.040
instead of me just buying
in Downtown Philadelphia,

18
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.750
I'm also going to buy one for each of
the suburbs because I like your service.

19
00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.200
It could be, I'm going to upgrade.

20
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.820
Instead of just having a black and
white ad I'm going to add color,

21
00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.700
I'm going to add a picture here.

22
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.390
It could be they like this service so

23
00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.250
well you're going to be able to
cross-sell them something else.

24
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.080
So there are some hypothesis about
how a more satisfied customer

25
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.520
is going to buy more in the future.

26
00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.750
So based on this,
they spend a lot of money putting in these

27
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.390
customer satisfaction issues and like a
lot of companies, they do market research.

28
00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.180
They did this market research and

29
00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.640
in truth, they really didn't know
whether these improvements in customer

30
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.960
satisfaction ultimately were producing
the financial results they wanted.

31
00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.090
We're spending money on this.

32
00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.570
Let's prove this.

33
00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.890
So one of the advantages of predictive
analytics I found in companies is

34
00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.770
you can use this if you're not
working in finance to help convince

35
00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.110
the chief financial officer that
these investments are making sense.

36
00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.760
Ultimately they want to
know show me the money.

37
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:48.980
So that's what happened here,

38
00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:54.220
the CFO was pushing the people in
marketing to show me that those customer

39
00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.960
satisfaction initiatives we're spending
all the money on, actually are translating

40
00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.450
through to performance because we're
using these metrics in our strategy.

41
00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.655
We're using this symmetric for performance
evaluation and like that other company,

42
00:02:07.655 --> 00:02:12.130
their bonus plan were based on
this performance symmetric.

43
00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.010
Again, it was whatâ€™s called
the top box measure.

44
00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.290
This is a company were satisfaction
ranges from one equals low to a hundred

45
00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.540
equals high.

46
00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:25.300
The bonus was based on what percentage
of our costumers gave us a 90 or above.

47
00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.072
Let's push everybody to the highest side.

48
00:02:27.072 --> 00:02:29.095
And again if you think
about target setting,

49
00:02:29.095 --> 00:02:31.340
this is one of those more
is better philosophies.

50
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.940
But the CFOs going to push us, so

51
00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.360
let's actually see if this
is actually paying off.

52
00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.580
Now the nice thing here
is this is a company

53
00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.110
where the customer sign
a one year contract.

54
00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.390
So you can actually link up how
satisfied was the customer this year and

55
00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.330
how much did they buy next year.

56
00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.360
That's the hypothesis
we're trying to test here.

57
00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.230
So here is the analytics that they did and

58
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.270
this is something called
non-linear regression.

59
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.820
It's basically we want to see how
these things are linked together here.

60
00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:09.810
Now if you look at this, this is really
great for about the first two-thirds,

61
00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.730
almost a nice perfect line between
how satisfied were you last year and

62
00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.120
what are you going to buy this year.

63
00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.730
Then you get these strange little steps.

64
00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.700
You gotta ask what those are.

65
00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:27.230
Then finally after about 75, people were
more satisfied but they didn't buy more.

66
00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.350
Now remember what the bonus was.

67
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.060
Get everybody 90 or above.

68
00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.890
Now if I look at this,

69
00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.080
the first thing you gotta ask yourself
is does that target make sense?

70
00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.360
Now obviously over
the whole spectrum here,

71
00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.240
there is a relationship between customer
satisfaction and future purchases.

72
00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.220
But we also have this target we have to
worry about which is everybody pushing

73
00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.940
towards the top.

74
00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.010
Well if you look at this I
would say the answer is no,

75
00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.660
it probably doesn't make sense.

76
00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.211
And it turns out when you talk
to these people after about 75,

77
00:04:02.211 --> 00:04:05.162
they've bought everything
they're going to buy.

78
00:04:05.162 --> 00:04:08.710
I don't need to buy
anymore advertisements.

79
00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:12.280
So you can increase my satisfaction,
you can spend money doing that.

80
00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.200
I'm not going to buy anymore,
I don't need anymore.

81
00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.160
The other thing is you have
these weird steps here.

82
00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.280
And again, here's where some
qualitative analysis added

83
00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.679
to the predictive analytics helps.

84
00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.700
It turns out what those steps are,

85
00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.850
is instead of them buying
in different cities.

86
00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:29.940
So we bought downtown Philadelphia and

87
00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.730
South Philadelphia and each one of the
suburbs, they start upgrading the service.

88
00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:38.220
They start going to full page ads,
they start adding color,

89
00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.820
they start throwing at
a picture of their service.

90
00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:45.120
But you had to be a certain amount
satisfied before you really upgraded.

91
00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.950
Which you're going to buy suppose you
are just buying more than ads on this.

92
00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:53.600
But you can after a certain point there,
it didn't get any more.

93
00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.443
So again the question is okay, if I am
not going to set this target up there,

94
00:04:57.443 --> 00:05:00.557
you know move everybody above 90,
where would you set it.

95
00:05:02.217 --> 00:05:04.290
Now remember, which you want
is biggest bang for the bark.

96
00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:08.350
If I tell my employees to move some
people from one box to the other one,

97
00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:09.950
where do I want them spending the money?

98
00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:12.690
Because they're going to go after
whoever I want them to go after, or

99
00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:14.620
whoever I tell them to go after.

100
00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.590
Well, it turns out, you probably want
to focus right there in the middle.

101
00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:25.300
If you believe this model,
it says if I can move some people

102
00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.840
off of that nice straight line at
the bottom and push them from,

103
00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:34.830
say, a 55 to a 65, that's when
they're going to buy a lot more.

104
00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:36.750
Those are the employees
I want to focus on.

105
00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:37.510
Not everybody.

106
00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:39.220
You do not have to focus on everybody.

107
00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.570
Let's focus on this group that,
based on this analytics,

108
00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:47.320
if I can spend money to
increase their satisfaction,

109
00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.590
those are the lines I should get
the biggest bang for the buck.

110
00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.500
Now, again, something else you need to
think about when you start doing that

111
00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:59.240
are the things that cause somebody
who's giving you a score of 90 already,

112
00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:03.560
the things that are drivers of
their satisfaction the same as

113
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.594
the drivers of somebody
who's given you a 50.

114
00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:08.270
Highly unlikely.

115
00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:12.780
Right, the people who already have
90 are satisfied on many dimensions,

116
00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:14.930
so asking about those
is not going to help.

117
00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:19.070
The thing that's going to get me go
from a 50 to 60 can be very different.

118
00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:22.780
So when I ask those satisfaction
questions what I want to know is,

119
00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:28.290
what dimensions of satisfaction would
cause somebody to move from 50 to 60?

120
00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:31.260
That's what you want to measure,
not just are you satisfied.

121
00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:35.760
Are you satisfied on a dimension
that somebody at 50 cares about,

122
00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.240
not on a dimension that
somebody at 90 cares about,

123
00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.530
because you're not focusing
on the 90s anymore.

124
00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:46.620
Okay, so based on that, let's focus on
these people in the middle on there.

125
00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:50.280
So here's another example,
we got a technology services company.

126
00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:54.270
Again we've got this issue of can you
demonstrate that this money we're spending

127
00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:57.600
on non financials is actually
paying off here, right?

128
00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:01.930
Are these non financial metrics actually
related to future financial performance?

129
00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:05.520
Now here's one of the dilemmas you're
going to run into if you start doing this.

130
00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.590
Again, data is not a problem in companies.

131
00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:11.350
But data is power.

132
00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:13.280
Information is power.

133
00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.480
What you're going to end up is
what we call data fiefdoms.

134
00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:19.657
Lots of different parts of the companies
own different parts of the data and

135
00:07:19.657 --> 00:07:22.190
they do not like to have
you have access to it.

136
00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:26.630
My experience, the hardest people to
get data from are the finance and

137
00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:27.319
accounting people.

138
00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:31.310
Right, they're going to claim that you
won't understand it, it's proprietary.

139
00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:33.880
But if you really want to link
non-financials to financials,

140
00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:36.160
we have to break down these
what are called data fiefdoms.

141
00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:38.690
So we had data fiefdoms here.

142
00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:39.560
We have to break these down.

143
00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:43.300
Now, the financial
outcomes they cared about

144
00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:49.450
was linking up these marketing metrics and
these quality metrics.

145
00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:52.350
So they also had some operational
metrics that had never been examined

146
00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:53.430
by the company.

147
00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:56.670
Now let me give an example
of what this company does.

148
00:07:56.670 --> 00:08:00.320
Part of what they do is
basically do cloud computing.

149
00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:05.290
They will do all the kind of
back office computing for you,

150
00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:08.360
put in the cloud,
they'll also implement systems for you.

151
00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:09.630
So we have two types of metrics.

152
00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:12.680
Some are metrics on we;ll ask
the customers how satisfied they are on

153
00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:13.960
various dimensions.

154
00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.450
Other ones are operational or
quality metrics.

155
00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:18.070
How much downtime do we have?

156
00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:19.810
How fast is our service?

157
00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:22.470
So we have two types of non-financial
metrics that we have to worry about.

158
00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:24.190
Some are survey based.

159
00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:26.280
Some are really hardcore
operational measures but

160
00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:28.140
they're not financial on this.

161
00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:30.880
Now, they had very strong
intuition that these customers and

162
00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:33.750
quality metrics they had were
related to future financial results.

163
00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:35.740
And here's kind of what you usually see.

164
00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:37.070
We know it's gotta be true.

165
00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:40.310
I've been in this business long enough
that if you customers are satisfied

166
00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:42.210
on these dimensions they buy more.

167
00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:45.690
If these quality statistics are better,
they're going to buy more.

168
00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:49.830
Well that's the intuition but again,
an intuition is a hypothesis.

169
00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:52.220
So here's what they wanted to look at.

170
00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:55.882
Let's relate these customer metrics or
operational metrics to financial outcomes.

171
00:08:55.882 --> 00:09:00.744
Now one thing you need to do is figure out
what financial outcomes do you care about?

172
00:09:00.744 --> 00:09:03.026
They don't have to be the same for
every company.

173
00:09:03.026 --> 00:09:07.270
Well here are the two things they really
cared about is annual revenue growth.

174
00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:12.260
Okay because you have lots of costs
that stay exactly the same, fixed costs.

175
00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.310
If I can grow the revenue,
my profits are going to go up.

176
00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:19.035
And what I really want to know is what
drives clients to have revenue growth

177
00:09:19.035 --> 00:09:20.188
greater than 15%.

178
00:09:20.188 --> 00:09:21.906
Those are the ones I want to focus on but

179
00:09:21.906 --> 00:09:24.890
I've got to figure out what
the drivers are there.

180
00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:27.960
They also have these operation or
quality metrics.

181
00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:31.395
This composite measure of things like
downtime, service availability, and

182
00:09:31.395 --> 00:09:33.330
things like that, they we're looking at.

183
00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:38.000
The customer metrics, they ask you
various things on five point scales.

184
00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.548
Overall how satisfied are you?

185
00:09:39.548 --> 00:09:44.120
Again, which of your willingness
to reference this word of mouth?

186
00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:45.866
What value do you think
you get out of this?

187
00:09:45.866 --> 00:09:47.792
And because we care
about contract renewal,

188
00:09:47.792 --> 00:09:51.260
what's the likelihood you think you're
actually going to buy our service again?

189
00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.730
Because it's easy enough to go to
another cloud computing provider.

190
00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:57.690
So what you need to do when you
these models is think about,

191
00:09:57.690 --> 00:10:00.220
you know what are the dimensions
in your strategy you care about,

192
00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:02.150
specifically what
are the financial outcomes?

193
00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:05.319
And here, it was really revenue
growth not overall profitability.

194
00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:08.680
So here's what you find.

195
00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:11.210
Let's look, and again,
we want leading indicators.

196
00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:14.940
Let's relate what kind of
satisfaction scores you give us

197
00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:17.130
on these various dimensions.

198
00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:21.930
And future revenue growth, which is
what we want as leading indicators.

199
00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:26.130
Well it turns out, a lot of these, the
green ones are statistically significant

200
00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:28.270
when you run the data analysis.

201
00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:30.815
The big once appear to be
overall satisfaction value.

202
00:10:30.815 --> 00:10:33.790
Look at service quality though.

203
00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:34.760
It's actually negative,

204
00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:39.540
it said as service quality goes up,
future revenue growth goes down.

205
00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:45.280
Now again we going to worry about this
all correlation versus causation here,

206
00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:47.120
what is causing this?

207
00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:48.410
And here's where you want to dig in.

208
00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:52.317
Well, what it turned out this
is a non-linear relationship.

209
00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:57.070
In cloud computing, you have to
have a certain amount of security.

210
00:10:57.070 --> 00:10:59.060
You have to have a certain
amount of uptime.

211
00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:01.860
If you don't meet that,
the customer's not going to be there.

212
00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:05.260
Once you meet it though, they're not
willing to pay for to make it higher.

213
00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.913
If you've got 99.9% reliability and

214
00:11:07.913 --> 00:11:12.786
you're going to charge them a lot
more to get to 99.9999% reliability.

215
00:11:12.786 --> 00:11:13.912
They don't want it.

216
00:11:13.912 --> 00:11:15.537
It is not worth it to them.

217
00:11:15.537 --> 00:11:20.450
So what you had here is they were pushing
that spectrum of service quality too high.

218
00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:21.830
Just didn't pay off.

219
00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:24.280
Not that service quality didn't matter.

220
00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:26.410
In fact, it's what's called a satisfizer.

221
00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:30.050
If you don't reach a certain level,
you're out of business, but

222
00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:32.890
above that it may not make too much
sense to actually improve too much.

223
00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:35.670
You've got to worry about whether your
customer is willing to pay for it.

224
00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:39.910
Now again, the other thing they really
cared about was not just revenue growth.

225
00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:43.720
Tell me the people that have
high future revenue growth.

226
00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:47.560
So here you're doing
something on a model where

227
00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:49.500
the thing you care about is zero one.

228
00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:51.160
Did you have high future growth or not?

229
00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:52.778
So you got to use different
statistical methods.

230
00:11:52.778 --> 00:11:56.170
But again what you see is this
negative on the service quality.

231
00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:58.780
When you run it just as a straight model

232
00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:01.320
you'd have to estimate
the non-linearities here.

233
00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:03.240
The thing that really mattered here,
value.

234
00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:05.430
Right.

235
00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:08.450
For some reason,
if people think this is a great value,

236
00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:11.680
that's when they're actually going
to have higher revenue growth.

237
00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:14.950
Now, always the big question then is,
how do I get higher value.

238
00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:17.550
What do they mean whey they answer this?

239
00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:20.520
And that's where you got to go into
the peeling the onion bag to say

240
00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:24.210
what dimensions of value could
use a manager actually do.

241
00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:25.982
To actually make this thing pay off.
