1
00:00:04.075 --> 00:00:07.248
Ultimately, if we're gonna link
non-financial metrics to financial

2
00:00:07.248 --> 00:00:10.524
performance, we gotta figure out how
do we take this analytics results and

3
00:00:10.524 --> 00:00:12.145
put them into a financial model?

4
00:00:12.145 --> 00:00:15.740
Cuz ultimately, what we're trying to
do is predict if these non-financial

5
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.470
metrics go up and down, what's gonna
be the impact on financial results.

6
00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.040
So here's an example of this.

7
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.012
We've got a computer hardware
manufacturer, major supplier of equipment.

8
00:00:25.012 --> 00:00:29.294
And again senior-management, they wanted
to know whether these customer initiatives

9
00:00:29.294 --> 00:00:32.510
these company was putting in
actually paid off or not.

10
00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:35.706
And more important than that, it's not
just that they pay off in the past,

11
00:00:35.706 --> 00:00:38.802
if I need to develop action plans that
will increase value in the future,

12
00:00:38.802 --> 00:00:40.301
what action plan should I take on?

13
00:00:40.301 --> 00:00:43.300
And obviously what I like is called
the biggest bang for the buck.

14
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.690
If I put a dollar in something,
where am I gonna get the biggest return,

15
00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.850
which non-financial metrics do I
wanna improve, and by how much?

16
00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.180
Now, the first thing you need to
think about is, when you do these,

17
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.620
what are the financial
outcomes that you care about?

18
00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.970
Because I need to predict that, and
it doesn't have to necessarily be profits,

19
00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.890
there could be intermediate
financial results you want.

20
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.078
So if you take something
like customer satisfaction,

21
00:01:06.078 --> 00:01:09.790
there's always a lots of reasons why
you want higher customer satisfaction,

22
00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.200
you think it's gonna keep the current
customers you have, or retention.

23
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.410
You think they're gonna
recommend your product and

24
00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.860
not too bad recommendations, are there
any good, get a bigger share of wallet,

25
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.058
a bigger proportion of
the expenditures by your customer.

26
00:01:22.058 --> 00:01:25.270
I mean there's various reasons why and
you need to lay out,

27
00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.730
when you're gonna estimate these models,
what are the outcomes that you care about?

28
00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.050
And ideally, what you like to do is
what are the intermediate outcomes?

29
00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.090
If you think about customer satisfaction
again, there is no reason that higher

30
00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.805
customer satisfaction necessarily
leads to higher performance.

31
00:01:39.805 --> 00:01:44.030
If only, if satisfaction goes up and
you can retain customers, and

32
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.970
they buy more and
you get bigger share of wallet, and

33
00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.090
they make positive recommendations,
that's when it pays off.

34
00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.830
So you need to set up,

35
00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.690
what are these intermediate outcomes
that you want if these things go up?

36
00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.890
So this is what the company picked.

37
00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.820
Now, the idea here is, yes,
customer satisfaction is going to

38
00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.020
impact these things, we're gonna try
to estimate what the impact is so

39
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.170
we can build a financial model.

40
00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.006
But if you're a manager,

41
00:02:07.006 --> 00:02:09.142
customer satisfaction actually
doesn't really mean anything.

42
00:02:09.142 --> 00:02:10.664
[LAUGH] Okay, they're satisfied.

43
00:02:10.664 --> 00:02:13.020
What does that mean to say
a customer is satisfied?

44
00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.460
What can you, as a manager,
do to actually change satisfaction and

45
00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.450
which dimensions do
customers really care about.

46
00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.360
So here's where you have to put
the front end of the model on this.

47
00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.560
Customer satisfaction is in the middle.

48
00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.400
What are the things that customers
care about that's gonna increase their

49
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.620
satisfaction in such a way that they buy
more from you, that they stay with you,

50
00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.449
that they make positive recommendations.

51
00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.610
So here, what the company did is, let's
go out and do some marketing research.

52
00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.690
Let's do some focus groups with customers.

53
00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.140
Let's see what they say would cause
them to actually buy more from us,

54
00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.770
and there's various things
that could happen, right?

55
00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.100
Do I think I've got a good
relationship with my supplier?

56
00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.910
Do I trust them?

57
00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.890
Do I think the value is high?

58
00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.730
Something like a personal computer, right?

59
00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.950
Do I think the thing actually works,
right?

60
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.667
Can I change over when I put
the new software onto this program?

61
00:03:02.667 --> 00:03:06.750
One of the big things is can I take
my old files and push it over there?

62
00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.560
So what you want is a manager
when you estimate these models.

63
00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.270
Yes, I want the financial results.

64
00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:15.770
But what I wanna know is what
are the specific actions I can take?

65
00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.670
Are these over on the other
side that will impact

66
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.230
satisfaction in such a way
that my financials go up?

67
00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.290
And where is the biggest bang for
the buck, right?

68
00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.050
Of these many dimensions I have over on
the left hand side, which one of those,

69
00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:31.350
if I had a dollar to invest,

70
00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.180
which one would I want to invest in
such that I get the biggest return?

71
00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.530
And that's the model we're gonna estimate.

72
00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.200
So what we have here is basically
a regression model, right?

73
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.700
First of all,
we're gonna say if satisfaction goes up,

74
00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.170
how much does retention go up?

75
00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.700
How much does word of mouth go up?

76
00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.900
How much do these ultimate
financial outcomes go up?

77
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.610
On the other end you've got,
which one of these dimensions or drivers

78
00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:59.140
actually cause customer satisfaction
to move up and down and by how much?

79
00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:00.860
So these are the estimates we have here.

80
00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.770
Now if you look at this diagram,
we got two things.

81
00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:07.590
We got things inside circles and
we have little numbers next to arrows.

82
00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.370
So here's what these things are, the
numbers in a circles, that tells you how

83
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.920
is this company doing on a 0 to 100 scale
in that dimension, 100 being the highest.

84
00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.110
Right, so if I get a 70,
I'm doing 70 out of 100.

85
00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:21.430
If I get 80 on that dimension,

86
00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.130
I'm doing 80 out of 100 where
80 says I'm doing better.

87
00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:30.680
The numbers next to the arrows, those are
the coefficients from a regression model.

88
00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.890
Basically, what it says is if I can
increase the score on those drivers to

89
00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:41.840
the left by one unit, here is the impact
I'm gonna have on my dependent variable.

90
00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.480
Either on customer satisfaction or if I'm
estimating economic outcomes, here's how

91
00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.730
a one unit change in satisfaction
impacts these economic outcomes.

92
00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:52.460
So here's an example.

93
00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.030
If you take those numbers, if you
increase the relationship score by ten.

94
00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.500
What these says is the customer
satisfaction scores gonna increase by 3,

95
00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:05.140
right, you take that 0.3 times 10,
so it's gonna go up by 3.

96
00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:08.940
Now if I can increase my
customer satisfaction score by 3,

97
00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:16.390
what does predicts is it's gonna increase
my retention score by 3, or from 73 to 76.

98
00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:20.050
Now based on that, if I can figure
out what's the financial benefit from

99
00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:24.430
keeping a customer,
I can come up with a financial model.

100
00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:28.350
Now again, if you go back to the diagram,
something I always ask my students is

101
00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:32.310
if you had a dollar,
where would you invest it, given this?

102
00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:36.363
Now a lot of times what people say is,
well invest it in trust because that

103
00:05:36.363 --> 00:05:40.229
coefficient, that number next to
the arrow, is biggest for trust.

104
00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:44.418
It's 0.8 which says if I could
increase my trust score by 1 point,

105
00:05:44.418 --> 00:05:47.835
my customer satisfaction
score is gonna go up by 0.8.

106
00:05:47.835 --> 00:05:52.702
That seems to make sense, but then
the question is do you really believe you

107
00:05:52.702 --> 00:05:55.714
can increase your trust
score by one point, or

108
00:05:55.714 --> 00:05:58.925
ten points, and
how much is it going to cost you?

109
00:05:58.925 --> 00:06:02.400
It may be the case, remember,
these are personal computers,

110
00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.720
they trust you as much as
they're gonna trust you, okay.

111
00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:09.260
They don't trust anybody perfectly, it may
be extremely hard to move the trust score

112
00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.920
above 0.8 where you're
already doing fairly well.

113
00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:13.710
It also maybe really expensive.

114
00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:19.580
It, alternatively, if you look at
your shopping score, you're doing so

115
00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.820
badly on that one, right?

116
00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:25.660
Something in the 60s and it may actually
be easier to go after that because

117
00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:29.410
if you're doing badly, it might be
easier and cheaper to improve that.

118
00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:32.610
So even though it has
this coefficient of 0.1,

119
00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:36.980
if it's easy to move that one by 10 points
and very hard to move trust by even 1

120
00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:40.630
point, you should probably
be going after the shopping.

121
00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:43.550
So, what you need is both that
model we just estimated which

122
00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:46.940
tells you the benefit from moving
the shopping or trust score.

123
00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:49.520
And what do you think the cost
would be to actually move this and

124
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.130
how easy is it to do that?

125
00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:52.110
Now based on that,

126
00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:56.510
you can start coming up with a financial
model which is ultimately what we want.

127
00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:59.049
If I increase trust or
if I increase shopping,

128
00:06:59.049 --> 00:07:03.347
what do I think the ultimate impact is
on retention, or recommendations, and

129
00:07:03.347 --> 00:07:06.170
the other financial outcomes
that we care about?

130
00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:09.890
Now, again, this is looking at
straight linear relationship.

131
00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:12.420
It just keeps going up
in a nice straight line.

132
00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:15.630
But we've found from some of the earlier
analyses that a lot of times,

133
00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:16.939
there's non-linearities.

134
00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:19.850
It doesn't keep going
up in a straight line.

135
00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:23.068
In fact, maybe you wanna be really
good at customer satisfaction, or

136
00:07:23.068 --> 00:07:25.043
maybe you wanna stop somewhere like 75.

137
00:07:25.043 --> 00:07:28.150
So here's where you wanna dig down deeper.

138
00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:29.580
So here's what the company did.

139
00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:31.730
Let's not stop there.

140
00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:32.970
Let's look a little further.

141
00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:34.880
Do we have any of these non-linearities?

142
00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:38.140
It turns out this is one of those
companies where you really wanna increase

143
00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:39.730
satisfaction.

144
00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:44.196
Cuz what they've found out is if you could
increase that retention score to 90 or

145
00:07:44.196 --> 00:07:47.964
above, the customer bought the same
brand again 56% of the time.

146
00:07:47.964 --> 00:07:53.500
If it was below 90,
they only bought it 30% of the time.

147
00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:57.610
That suggests you really, really wanna
spend money to get customers above 90.

148
00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:01.370
That's when they start buying a lot more
of this stuff and they stick with you.

149
00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:03.300
Same thing with the recommendation score.

150
00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:06.735
If it was 90 or
above they recommended about 1.5 times.

151
00:08:06.735 --> 00:08:10.070
If it was below 90, it was less than once.

152
00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:11.690
Those are fairly big changes.

153
00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:16.880
So here's a company where it would say,
if I can push my customers above 90,

154
00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:18.680
there's a huge payback.

155
00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.670
Because there's a big difference
once you get passed this 90,

156
00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:24.590
in terms of whether you're gonna
keep them or recommend them.

157
00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:28.540
So now the question would be, I've got
to pick action plans, cuz ultimately,

158
00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:29.250
that's what I want.

159
00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:32.560
Can I use analytics to pick out
which action plans are gonna

160
00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:35.570
result in this higher
financial performance?

161
00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:38.880
So based on this, what you might say is,
let's try to pick action plans that

162
00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:42.080
are gonna move customer scores above
90 cuz that's where the big payoff is,

163
00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:44.100
if I can move them above 90 on here.

164
00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:45.830
So let's make an assumption.

165
00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:47.870
And you would have to do some
market research to figure this.

166
00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:54.170
Let's assume that you could probably move
a customer score by a maximum of ten

167
00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:58.260
points and that's probably true because
customer satisfaction scores are really

168
00:08:58.260 --> 00:08:59.360
hard to move.

169
00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:02.400
They're easy to move down if you had
a disaster, people get less satisfied,

170
00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:04.180
but they're really fairly hard to move up.

171
00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:07.625
So let's say the most on a 100 point
scale you could move them is 10.

172
00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:13.310
But what that would say is if I want to
move people above 90, there's only a small

173
00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:18.320
number of customers that I could move 10
points that are gonna push me above 90.

174
00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:19.300
So at that point,

175
00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:23.180
what you wanna do is figure out
which customers do I wanna focus on?

176
00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:24.220
It's not all the customers.

177
00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:29.040
What I want are the ones that I can do
something that might move them 10 points,

178
00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:30.970
and move them over this 90 threshold,

179
00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:34.350
that's where you're gonna get
the biggest bang for the buck.

180
00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:36.250
So here's what you're gonna do.

181
00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:38.930
If you start looking at
all their customers, and

182
00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:42.829
here's just some diagrams of how many
customers you have at each score.

183
00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:47.640
The people you wanna focus your action
plans on, the one based on analytics,

184
00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:51.180
you're gonna get the biggest bang for
the buck are the people in the red bars.

185
00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:56.280
Those are the people where I
could move them about 10 points

186
00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:59.080
over that 90 threshold and
based on my analytics,

187
00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:02.910
I believe that they're gonna recommend a
lot more and they're gonna stick with me.

188
00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:03.520
So roughly,

189
00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:07.580
it's about 16% of the customers you
wanna focus on, not all of them.

190
00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:11.930
Okay, now based on that, let's see if we
can come up with the financial model.

191
00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:14.960
So what we're gonna do is say,

192
00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:19.900
okay, if I focus on these 16% of
the people, how much is it gonna

193
00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:25.100
cost me to put a customer initiative
in that's gonna move them up 10 points.

194
00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:29.120
If I move them up 10 points,
what do I think the financial benefit is

195
00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:33.470
from retaining them, and
from having them recommend people more?

196
00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:36.480
Well, the way we can do that now is
take the analytics, and basically,

197
00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:38.702
we're gonna do a little Excel spreadsheet.

198
00:10:38.702 --> 00:10:41.269
We're gonna come up with what's
called a net present value.

199
00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:44.990
Again, net present value because some
of the benefits are gonna come out in

200
00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:45.720
multiple years.

201
00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:48.530
And I need to discount those back
because I would rather have a dollar

202
00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:49.840
now than a dollar in the future.

203
00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:54.970
So here's the little spreadsheet
we're gonna have here.

204
00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:57.900
So here's some of the assumptions
we're gonna make, okay?

205
00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:01.710
First of all, and again you would have
to base this on what your company does,

206
00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:04.310
let's assume we got
a five year time horizon.

207
00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:08.160
What happens now is satisfaction's gonna
have no impact after five years especially

208
00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:12.750
with something like technology, right,
new players come in, new technology.

209
00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:15.348
Let's assume we have a 15% discount rate.

210
00:11:15.348 --> 00:11:17.637
There's a cost to capital
in your organization,

211
00:11:17.637 --> 00:11:20.032
how much do I have to go out and
borrow the money from,

212
00:11:20.032 --> 00:11:22.770
how much did I have to pay to
get money from my shareholders.

213
00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:26.140
Let's assume 15%, which right now
is very high, but we use it for

214
00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:27.720
arguments purposes.

215
00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:30.185
Now the margins on a personal
computer are pretty small.

216
00:11:30.185 --> 00:11:36.050
Let's say on average, you could sell
a $2,000 high end personal computer.

217
00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:38.960
The margin you're gonna
get out of that's $145.

218
00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:40.369
You're not gonna make much on each of one

219
00:11:40.369 --> 00:11:41.990
of these sales relative
to the selling price.

220
00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:47.410
So let's assume what we're thinking
about is, can we invest $5 million

221
00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:50.130
in some kind of customer
satisfaction improvement initiative,

222
00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:54.730
where we get a five year horizon and
15% discount rate?

223
00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:57.230
Let's see what the benefit would be there.

224
00:11:57.230 --> 00:11:59.560
Now here's the estimates we did before.

225
00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:05.031
We estimated that 25.99% improvement in
retention if I could move people over 90,

226
00:12:05.031 --> 00:12:09.366
we estimated a 0.65 change in
recommendations if you could move them

227
00:12:09.366 --> 00:12:10.161
above 90.

228
00:12:10.161 --> 00:12:13.605
Now you need to think about is,
of those people,

229
00:12:13.605 --> 00:12:17.640
how many do you think you could
actually move ten points?

230
00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:21.560
All right, cuz obviously you're not
gonna be able to move all of them.

231
00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:23.660
So here's where you wanna
do market research.

232
00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:27.000
Based on some more analytics that
you do with market research,

233
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.620
what's the odds that we could move
somebody up at least ten points?

234
00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:34.308
If you think it's 20%,
20%, if it's 30, it's 30%.

235
00:12:34.308 --> 00:12:39.280
Cuz that's gonna have an impact on
whether you think this works or not.

236
00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:40.700
So based on those assumptions,

237
00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:44.760
which are in the spreadsheet,
we're gonna compute the net present value.

238
00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:46.891
Again, with the net present value,
you've got cash going out.

239
00:12:46.891 --> 00:12:49.690
Well that's the $5 million right now.

240
00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:53.360
Then I've got cash coming back in.

241
00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:56.450
Well, the cash comes in either because
I stick with you and I buy one of your

242
00:12:56.450 --> 00:13:00.480
computers later, or I recommend
to somebody else and they buy it.

243
00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:04.010
And again, based on this analytics and
market research, we can estimate that.

244
00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:06.960
And based on that, we can come back and

245
00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:10.790
just with this simple scenario,
you get a huge payback.

246
00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:13.390
Now obviously, these are all estimates.

247
00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:16.860
But the nice thing here is you use
the analytics to start the estimates.

248
00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:20.180
Based on that,
you come up with a spreadsheet.

249
00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:22.440
Now you can start doing
a lot of what if analyses.

250
00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:26.300
What if I change my
discount rate to only 5%?

251
00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:27.860
Which is getting closer
to what it is right now,

252
00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:30.760
where you have almost no interest rates.

253
00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:33.380
What happens if my margins go up to $200?

254
00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:35.320
What happens if they go down to 100?

255
00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:40.140
So once you set up this spreadsheet that's
based on the analytics, you can do a whole

256
00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:43.070
bunch of what if analyses by
changing some of these parameters,

257
00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:45.110
saying this is an estimate.

258
00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:50.549
How comfortable are you if this
estimate is off by 10% positive,

259
00:13:50.549 --> 00:13:53.610
5% at negative and
come up with a comfort zone?

260
00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:54.240
Based on that,

261
00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:58.640
how comfortable are you investing $5
million to improve this dimension?

262
00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:02.820
But it all starts with the analytics cuz
you have to come up with some parameters

263
00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:04.910
to start estimating
these financial models,

264
00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:07.560
then you can start doing
the what if analyses on this.
