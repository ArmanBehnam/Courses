00:00:04.061 --> 00:00:07.244
Hello, I'm Chris Ittner, the EY Professor
of Accounting at Wharton, where

2
00:00:07.244 --> 00:00:10.445
I specialize in Management Accounting and
Performance Measurement issues.

3
00:00:10.445 --> 00:00:13.357
What we're going to talk about today
is Linking Nonfinancial Metrics

4
00:00:13.357 --> 00:00:14.575
to Financial Performance.

5
00:00:14.575 --> 00:00:16.760
Now there's lots of reasons why
this is important, in fact,

6
00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.390
this is probably one of the most important
things we do as managers, right?

7
00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.550
We need to forecast future
financial performance,

8
00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.460
but if you think about it, right,
the actions you take are nonfinancials.

9
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.150
Am I going to invest money in R&D?

10
00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:29.560
Am I going to do a marketing initiative?

11
00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:30.940
Am I going to improve my quality?

12
00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.041
And am I going to introduce a new product?

13
00:00:33.041 --> 00:00:36.157
So what we want to know is,
if we take these nonfinancial actions,

14
00:00:36.157 --> 00:00:39.851
how do we think that's ultimately going to
impact our financial performance?

15
00:00:39.851 --> 00:00:43.220
So we need to know this for
forecasting future cash flows.

16
00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.980
We need to know when we're going to choose
projects of the many choices I have

17
00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.320
of improving things.

18
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.150
Do I focus on improving
customer satisfaction, or

19
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.300
do I focus on improving
the quality of my product?

20
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.810
Well, both of those are nonfinancial.

21
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.780
What I want to know is, when I
improve this nonfinancial dimension,

22
00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.080
what's the ultimate impact going to
be on my financial performance?

23
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.280
And obviously one of the big
reasons we care about this,

24
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.230
is you're going to get evaluated
on this for performance measures.

25
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.696
A lot of companies been putting
in dashboards and scorecards,

26
00:01:09.696 --> 00:01:11.844
they're everywhere,
for-profit, non-profit.

27
00:01:11.844 --> 00:01:15.355
The idea there is a lot of the actions
that you take as a manager,

28
00:01:15.355 --> 00:01:19.481
do not show up in short term financial
results for a while, there is a lag.

29
00:01:19.481 --> 00:01:20.066
Or even worse,

30
00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:23.050
they actually make your short-term
financial performance get worse.

31
00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.320
because under accounting rules, if you
spend money on research and development,

32
00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.230
or building the brand of your company, it
actually hurts your short-term financial

33
00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:34.400
performance even if in the long run this
is a good thing for your organization.

34
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.640
So what we need to know is, given the many
nonfinancial performance measures we could

35
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.630
use, which one of those actually
tell us something we care about,

36
00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.880
which is which one of those actually say,
if we make this measure go up and

37
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.450
down, it actually makes our financial
performance in the future go up.

38
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.090
So what we're going to do today,
is talk about okay, how can

39
00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.900
we pick out which nonfinancial performance
measures are actually informative,

40
00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.100
which ones actually tell us whether
they're predictive financial results.

41
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.060
How do we set targets?

42
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.640
Well targets are easy for
financial numbers, more is better.

43
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.360
I prefer more money.

44
00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.790
It's not so simple when you start
talking about nonfinancials.

45
00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:12.720
How happy do you want
your employees to be?

46
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.930
How satisfied do you want your customers?

47
00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.160
I could have the most satisfied customers
in the world, I know how to do that.

48
00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.390
Take a box, pack it full of money.

49
00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.340
The amount of money is less than
what you pay for it, guess what,

50
00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.160
you're completely satisfied and
your company's out of business.

51
00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.760
So that's what we're going to do is,
let's go through how do you pick

52
00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.080
these nonfinancial measures using
analytics to say which ones,

53
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.750
when they move,
actually improve financial performance?

54
00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.310
Then how do I pick the targets for these?

55
00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:38.720
How happy do I want my employees?

56
00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.751
What kind of employee turnover do I want?

57
00:02:40.751 --> 00:02:44.221
And finally we're going to give some
comprehensive examples of how companies

58
00:02:44.221 --> 00:02:44.988
have used this.

59
00:02:44.988 --> 00:02:49.259
To start coming up with financial models
that allow you to say, if I invest money

60
00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:53.920
in a nonfinancial dimension, how do I
expect that to pay off in the future?

61
00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.520
And finally we're going to finish with
some of the organizational issues you

62
00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.220
really have to worry about.

63
00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.100
This is not just statistics
we're talking about here.

64
00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.570
We're trying to change the way
you run your business, and

65
00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.550
this could have major implications
including things like politics.

66
00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.050
If you tell somebody that they've been
doing something wrong based on your

67
00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.700
predictive analytics,
you'd better be prepared for pushback.

68
00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.959
So there's the outline of what we're
going to actually do over this session.

69
00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.610
Okay, so here's some fundamental
questions we need to ask when we start

70
00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.040
talking about nonfinancial measures
in leading into financials.

71
00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.640
One, what should we be measuring?

72
00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.820
I don't have any problem coming
up with nonfinancial measures,

73
00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.920
we could sit around the table here, in 15
minutes, we could come up with hundreds.

74
00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.030
What I want to know is, of those
hundreds of nonfinancial measures, which

75
00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.290
one of those when they move up and down,
actually tell me something I care about?

76
00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.790
It's not just a matter
of I want nonfinancials.

77
00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.340
What we want are, what are the key
drivers of financial success?

78
00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.970
Now drivers is a very important word here.

79
00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.170
That means,
when a manager actually takes this action,

80
00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.350
it actually leads to this thing I
care about on the other side on this.

81
00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.736
And that's what we want to get
with predictive analytics,

82
00:04:00.736 --> 00:04:02.827
is I want to predict this,
based on these actions,

83
00:04:02.827 --> 00:04:04.984
what is going to drive future
financial performance?

84
00:04:04.984 --> 00:04:07.318
So that's the first thing is
what are we going to measure?

85
00:04:07.318 --> 00:04:09.925
The next thing we have to worry about is,
how do I rank or

86
00:04:09.925 --> 00:04:13.000
weight these things when I have
various financial measures?

87
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.380
Now some of your companies have
something called a balance scorecard.

88
00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.550
And with the balance scorecard
you have financial measures, but

89
00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:21.990
you also have customer measures.

90
00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:24.650
You have operations or
productivity measures, and

91
00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.840
you have what are called learning and
growth measures.

92
00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.160
Well, that's great, so

93
00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.181
you have this balance scorecard that may
have dozens of performance measures.

94
00:04:32.181 --> 00:04:36.699
How do I know how to rank or weight these
varies, do I really want to spend more

95
00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:40.658
time on improving quality or
improving customer satisfaction?

96
00:04:40.658 --> 00:04:44.289
It's really easy to rank financial
numbers, because they're all in currency,

97
00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:46.340
they're in a common denominator.

98
00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.060
The problem with nonfinancial measures is,
they're not in a common denominator.

99
00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.325
Some are in percentages,
some are in weight, some are in time,

100
00:04:53.325 --> 00:04:55.010
they could be in anything.

101
00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:58.670
How do I combine those or
figure out which one's more important?

102
00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.550
Now given that, I also have to make
tradeoffs, because it could be that in

103
00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:08.610
the short-run, if I approve one measure,
the other one is going to go down.

104
00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.745
And a good example would be the tradeoff
between short-term nonfinancial and

105
00:05:12.745 --> 00:05:14.740
short-term financial.

106
00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.130
Again, under accounting rules,
if you spend money on research and

107
00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.650
development, right,
that could be a nonfinancial.

108
00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.058
Are we doing the research
projects we want?

109
00:05:23.058 --> 00:05:26.340
In the short-run,
all the money you spent on research and

110
00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:30.200
development, makes your short-run
accounting profits go down.

111
00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.470
That's how the accounting rules work.

112
00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:35.598
Now in the long-run, obviously,
if you think these are good research and

113
00:05:35.598 --> 00:05:39.088
development projects, ultimately you're
going to get better financial results.

114
00:05:39.088 --> 00:05:43.150
But in the short-run there's a tradeoff,
so what we need to decide is, okay when is

115
00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:46.255
this going to pay off and what kind
of tradeoff am I willing to make?

116
00:05:46.255 --> 00:05:50.301
And finally, again, probably one of
the hardest things to do with nonfinancial

117
00:05:50.301 --> 00:05:53.630
measures, what performance
targets do we want?

118
00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:57.400
More is not necessarily better with these.

119
00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.770
So the steps we're going to
have to go through again is,

120
00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:00.680
what should we be measuring?

121
00:06:01.722 --> 00:06:04.400
How we're going to weight these very,
very different performance measures

122
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.780
when I'm trying to analyze
the potential financial results?

123
00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:11.080
How do I make tradeoffs between
short-term and long-term?

124
00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.320
And finally, how am I going to
set these performance targets?

125
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:17.830
Now there's lots of ways we
could go about doing this,

126
00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:21.440
and it's not like companies
don't make these decisions.

127
00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.570
We make these decisions all the time.

128
00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:25.305
Now I could do it just based on intuition.

129
00:06:25.305 --> 00:06:28.860
I've been in this business a long time,
I know this industry,

130
00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:30.260
I know our customer base.

131
00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.150
It must be true.

132
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:34.894
That if x goes up,
ys going to happen in the long-run.

133
00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:40.059
Well, that may be right, but we live in
a very dynamic world that maybe that was

134
00:06:40.059 --> 00:06:42.504
right last year and
it's not right this year.

135
00:06:42.504 --> 00:06:46.319
Or maybe your intuition is 90% correct.

136
00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:49.265
It's that 10% that may not be correct,
that's really going to give you

137
00:06:49.265 --> 00:06:52.210
competitive advantage and
we want to understand that.

138
00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:55.380
Now I could go beyond that,
get past one person's intuition and

139
00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:57.440
use management consensus.

140
00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.750
We get a whole bunch of really smart
people to sit around the room and

141
00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:04.270
decide these nonfinancial measures are
going to lead to these financial results.

142
00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:07.980
Except most of us have been in
meetings where consensus really means

143
00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:09.130
who's loudest.

144
00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:12.540
Okay, whoever's loudest and
talks the most, they win.

145
00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:15.290
Consensus does not really
mean it's necessarily right.

146
00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:18.220
Now obviously it's a good place to start,
right?

147
00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:22.090
We could use one of these measurement
frameworks or benchmarking studies.

148
00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:23.400
Use the balance scorecard,

149
00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:26.430
you've got four categories, I have to
have measures in each one of those.

150
00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:29.550
That must be true that they
lead to financial performance.

151
00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:31.014
I could use a benchmarking study.

152
00:07:31.014 --> 00:07:35.114
I go out, I hire a consultant,
I ask them, what is best practices?

153
00:07:35.114 --> 00:07:38.810
Let me tell you, this is the worst
question I ever get as a consultant.

154
00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:41.398
Best practices means you're doing
exactly what the other guy is doing.

155
00:07:41.398 --> 00:07:45.101
No, what you want to do is,
how can I figure out in my company,

156
00:07:45.101 --> 00:07:48.761
what nonfinancial measures I
need to make my strategy work?

157
00:07:48.761 --> 00:07:52.120
Not what are other guys using
to make their strategy work.

158
00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:53.930
We could do informal data analyses.

159
00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:56.110
We kind of plot some stuff
on Excel spreadsheet, and

160
00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:58.235
they kind of look like they're
correlated with each other,

161
00:07:58.235 --> 00:08:00.390
that kind of looks like when this goes up,
that one goes up as well.

162
00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:04.450
What we're going to talk about
today is not, let's get past that.

163
00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:07.970
Okay, let's try do to more rigorous
predictive analytics methods, right.

164
00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:12.360
The tools are there, most of our
software packages have the capability.

165
00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:16.870
As companies say, we have lots of data,
but we have little information.

166
00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:21.770
What we're trying to do is, turn
the data that almost every company has,

167
00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:24.650
into information or
something that I can say,

168
00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:28.210
when this measure goes up,
what's going to happen on the other side?

169
00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:30.170
Data is not the problem in companies.

170
00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:32.220
Coming up with measures is not a problem.

171
00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:34.180
The problem is coming up with data or

172
00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:38.700
measures that tell me something
about future financial performance.

173
00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:41.930
Now there is a theory we can start
use to structure this analysis, and

174
00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:43.990
it's a good way to think about this.

175
00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:48.880
The first thing we have to start out
is developing something called a causal

176
00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:51.790
business model or
a strategy map, that describes

177
00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:55.200
what are the value drivers in your company
and how are they linked to strategy?

178
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.120
So here's what you want to think about.

179
00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:00.440
What a causal model is,
is an if then statement.

180
00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:03.800
If this happens,
then I expect something else to happen.

181
00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:06.720
Now what you want to do is
start out with your strategy.

182
00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:10.099
Pull out your strategic plan, and
for those of you who have never seen

183
00:09:10.099 --> 00:09:13.440
a strategic plan,
they are actually extremely high level.

184
00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:16.511
going to move into this market,
we're going to go into this product line,

185
00:09:16.511 --> 00:09:17.510
we're going to divest.

186
00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:20.000
They actually don't tell you
how you're going to get there.

187
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.908
What a causal model is,
is start out with a strategy and say,

188
00:09:23.908 --> 00:09:28.600
these are the steps I need to take,
from a to z to make this strategy work.

189
00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:30.710
First, I've got to do that.

190
00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:32.668
Now when I do that,
that should lead to this next thing.

191
00:09:32.668 --> 00:09:34.620
Which should lead to the next thing?

192
00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:39.430
There's a cause and effect relationship
between putting the strategy in, and

193
00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:42.230
getting the ultimate financial results.

194
00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:45.540
So what you want to do is,
start out with this causal model.

195
00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:47.980
Here's a strategy,
here are the steps I need to take.

196
00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:51.080
Once you know those steps,

197
00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:55.140
then you can lay out what are called
the value propositions or hypotheses.

198
00:09:55.140 --> 00:10:00.060
How is it that we as an organization,
think we're going to create value?

199
00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:03.740
Now value, in many for-profit
companies' going to be financial.

200
00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:06.660
If you're a nonprofit, it doesn't have to
be financials, just here's the ultimate

201
00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:11.120
goals I want to get, if you think
about it a strategy is a hypothesis.

202
00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:13.690
Here is how I think I will get there.

203
00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:16.300
The question is, when you implement
the strategy, will it work?

204
00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:18.710
Well that's testing the hypothesis, right?

205
00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:23.390
I've got these steps I need to go through,
I'm predicting that a happens,

206
00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:26.030
then b then c,
well let's see if that's true.

207
00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:29.100
When I implement a let's come
up with a performance measure.

208
00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:30.000
Does it predict b?

209
00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:33.760
If b happens, does it predict c?

210
00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:37.430
Because what you don't want to do is wait
to see if financial results work or not.

211
00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:41.220
Am I taking the intermediate
steps that I need to do,

212
00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:45.310
to achieve my financial goals that
ultimately lead to financial performance?

213
00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:47.900
Because financial performance
could be a long way out there.

214
00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:50.290
I don't want to wait to
see if this works or not.

215
00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:53.170
Okay, now that you have that,
here are the steps I need.

216
00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:56.670
I'm going to come up with performance
measures to see if I've done the steps.

217
00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:58.040
Let's test those hypothesis.

218
00:10:59.050 --> 00:11:00.920
If your causal model again says,

219
00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:05.560
I need to do a, that's going to lead to b,
that's going to lead to c, let's test it.

220
00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:09.700
When I implement a,
let's come up with a measure that says,

221
00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:11.320
did I implement it well?

222
00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:14.500
Then let's see if there's a relationship
when that measure related to

223
00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:15.420
a goes up and down.

224
00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:18.450
Did the measure related to b go up and
down?

225
00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:22.761
Right, that's the hypothesis
that if I do a, b will change.

226
00:11:22.761 --> 00:11:25.594
Now if I don't find that,
I want to know why.

227
00:11:25.594 --> 00:11:26.990
Well there's lots of reasons why.

228
00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:28.500
Your strategy's wrong.

229
00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:30.970
There's no reason
strategy has to be right.

230
00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:33.400
Two, your measures are garbage.

231
00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:34.940
I can measure all kinds of stuff,

232
00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:37.650
that doesn't mean it
actually predicts anything.

233
00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:40.190
You could ask me on a customer
satisfaction survey whether I like

234
00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:41.660
the color on the wall?

235
00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:44.930
I'll answer it, but it doesn't tell
you whether I'm going to buy again.

236
00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:47.850
It could be there's
an organizational barrier.

237
00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:48.910
Yes, a happened but

238
00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:51.830
b didn't, because somebody wasn't
doing something they were supposed to.

239
00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:53.760
All of these I want to know.

240
00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:54.380
But to do that,

241
00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:57.780
I first of all I want to see is there
a relationship between a and b?

242
00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:00.220
That's the role of analytics.

243
00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:04.199
Now based on these results, right, now I
can start coming up with decision-making

244
00:12:04.199 --> 00:12:06.061
models and performance evaluations.

245
00:12:06.061 --> 00:12:10.936
Okay, if the analytic says when a happens,
b happens, and here's the magnitude.

246
00:12:10.936 --> 00:12:14.671
Well I can start coming up with
a little financial model that says,

247
00:12:14.671 --> 00:12:18.069
if I invest a $100 in a, and
it moves that metrics by two,

248
00:12:18.069 --> 00:12:21.480
what's going to happen to b,
well it may move that by five.

249
00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:25.960
When b happens and it goes up by five,
that may changes something else by three.

250
00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:29.460
So based on these relationships,
as you go through the causal model,

251
00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:33.570
all you're going to do is build a little
mathematical model that says if I do a,

252
00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:37.010
here's ultimately how it's going to
translate, to improve financial

253
00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:40.750
performance on the end, because
financial performance is an end-game.

254
00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:44.738
But I need to know these intermediate
steps, I need to know how big.

255
00:12:44.738 --> 00:12:48.321
If I approve a, what is the impact on b?

256
00:12:48.321 --> 00:12:52.048
I could also use this for performance
evaluations, because obviously, if

257
00:12:52.048 --> 00:12:56.350
I evaluate you on a performance measure,
guess what, you're going to improve it.

258
00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:59.280
I mean people will go for
whatever you're getting measured on.

259
00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:00.960
The question is when you
improve that measure,

260
00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:03.930
are you actually making your
organization better off or not?

261
00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:06.435
Well I don't know until I can
figure out whether this metric,

262
00:13:06.435 --> 00:13:09.280
this measure I gave you in your bonus
plan or performance evaluation,

263
00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:10.838
whether it's actually predictive.

264
00:13:10.838 --> 00:13:14.161
So once I find these predictive measures,
that's what you want

265
00:13:14.161 --> 00:13:17.744
to evaluate employees and managers on,
not just any nonfinancial.

266
00:13:17.744 --> 00:13:23.140
The ones that when they move around,
actually tell me something I care about.

267
00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:26.220
And finally,
this should be a dynamic tool, right?

268
00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:29.590
Strategies are changing, performance
measures that were good before,

269
00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:31.020
may not be good anymore.

270
00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:32.880
Competitors are coming in.

271
00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:37.567
How can we set up an ongoing mechanism
that's going to allow us to use these

272
00:13:37.567 --> 00:13:41.094
analytics to refine our
strategy over time, right?

273
00:13:41.094 --> 00:13:44.374
Change or see if our value
predictions actually work?

274
00:13:44.374 --> 00:13:47.894
And keep our measures up to date, because
the last thing you want to be using,

275
00:13:47.894 --> 00:13:51.689
is a measure that was real predictive two
years ago, and the economy has changed so

276
00:13:51.689 --> 00:13:54.070
much now, it doesn't predict anything.

277
00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:58.062
So somehow we need to set in a mechanism
that's going to allow us to do this on

278
00:13:58.062 --> 00:13:59.116
an ongoing basis.
