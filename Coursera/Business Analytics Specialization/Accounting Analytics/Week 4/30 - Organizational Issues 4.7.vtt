00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:07.142
One of the biggest issues you're going to
have to deal with if you're going to start

2
00:00:07.142 --> 00:00:11.110
doing predictive analytics, is dealing
with some of the organizational issues.

3
00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:14.270
These can be politics,
these can be technology, but

4
00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:16.170
ultimately remember what we're doing.

5
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.350
We're taking data, big data if you
have it, we're estimating some models.

6
00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.550
That requires technology, and
then base on those models

7
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.490
I'm going to start changing
my organization, guess what?

8
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.710
Some people are going to win and
some people are going to lose.

9
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.350
You may find out that an intuition or
hypothesis you had is completely wrong.

10
00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.580
The person who's basically made
their career based on intuition is

11
00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.320
going to be real happy on this.

12
00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.000
So here are some of the issues that
you're going to need to think about,

13
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.640
if you're going to start
doing predictive analytics.

14
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.940
Okay, some of the common reasons why
companies have trouble doing this right.

15
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.630
Insufficient model development right?

16
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:56.850
You can do data mining, which has
a lot of benefits doing data mining,

17
00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.200
but ultimately what you want to know is,
right.

18
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.830
What leads to what?

19
00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:04.300
And what actions can I actually
take as a company to do this?

20
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.130
So even if you do the data mining,
you need to again start doing this peeling

21
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.230
back the onion which means, you need
to think about what these linkages are.

22
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.300
For my strategy, what do I think
this causal business model is?

23
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.020
How is it that I'm
going to implement this.

24
00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.930
Will I think that A is going to
lead to B is going to lead to C?

25
00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.470
Let's see, but you need to lay that out.

26
00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.640
The other problem I've seen in a lot
of companies is, they will ask me,

27
00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.420
okay, what's best practices.

28
00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.360
Or I saw this benchmarking model, or

29
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.000
this generic measurement framework
like the balance scorecard.

30
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.720
So I'm going to use that to
pick my performance measures.

31
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.730
Well these problems with that.

32
00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.690
Again, strategic advantage means you're
doing something different than your

33
00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:42.880
competitors.

34
00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.540
So the last thing I want to
do is benchmark myself and

35
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.450
do exactly what they're doing.

36
00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.030
The other problem with generic
measurement frameworks, they're generic.

37
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.000
Which means it says okay,
everybody should be doing this.

38
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.470
Now what you want to do is tailor
both the measures that you track, and

39
00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.390
the analysis you do to
the strategy of your company.

40
00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.380
So if I think I'm going to
compete on a different dimension,

41
00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.820
I do not want to be doing
what the other guy did.

42
00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.260
So this means there's going to
be a lot of up front,

43
00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.860
starting with your strategy to decide,

44
00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.950
here's the analytic models I want to
estimate, it's not purely statistics.

45
00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.010
And based on that, what are the actions
that we as a company can take?

46
00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.040
Another problem you have is,
we are taking measures, right?

47
00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.060
Measures can be good.

48
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.110
Measures can be really bad.

49
00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:27.880
Couple of reasons of why you
might have measures that are bad,

50
00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.060
are what are called
psychometric properties.

51
00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.240
One, does it really pick up
what you claim it's picking up?

52
00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.790
Right, you're trying to
estimate some construct, and

53
00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.260
I gotta find some way of measuring
this kind of intangible thing.

54
00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.970
Well is that measure you have is that
really picking up that intangible you

55
00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.320
care about?

56
00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.820
And the other thing is,
is this influenced by so

57
00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.840
many other things that it bounces up and
down all over the place.

58
00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.540
And I have no idea whether that means
you're doing well or not doing well.

59
00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.130
Now this really becomes a problem when
you start using surveys for questions.

60
00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.580
One of the problems is you
may have too few questions.

61
00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.530
Right, like how satisfied are you,
a little, a lot, and

62
00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.020
that's the only question I ask you.

63
00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:07.710
That doesn't help me much afterwards.

64
00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:11.070
because even if I find a relationship,
I don't know which dimensions of

65
00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.270
satisfaction you answered about, and
I don't know what to do as a manager.

66
00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.190
Another one with scales is,
you have too few scale points.

67
00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.530
You're using one to three,
I'm not satisfied, I'm very satisfied, or

68
00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:23.640
I'm in the middle.

69
00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.600
That doesn't really tell you a lot.

70
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.080
Or you use what's called
the top box measure.

71
00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.500
Say your satisfaction skill
goes from one to five,

72
00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.960
what percentage of the people are at five?

73
00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.420
That may be fine as we saw
in some of the examples.

74
00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.070
In other examples it may not be fine.

75
00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:41.280
You need to do the analysis of whether
moving everybody to the top of the box

76
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.390
even makes any sense.

77
00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.340
But again what you would
like to have are measures,

78
00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.379
what's called good signal to noise ratio.

79
00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:53.060
Signal means it's responsive
to managerial actions.

80
00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:54.800
When they take an action I like,
it goes up.

81
00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.040
When they take an action that's not good,
it goes down.

82
00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.120
So it's responsive.

83
00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.680
Noise means it's not
effected by all kinds of

84
00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.980
other stuff that are outside
of your company's control.

85
00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:05.950
It's not just bouncing all up and down.

86
00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.030
So if you could pick measures, or
analyze measures that have high signal.

87
00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.060
They respond to the actions we take.

88
00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.440
And low noise, they're not affected by
all kinds of stuff outside our control.

89
00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.470
That's going to help you when you do
the statistics, because it's more

90
00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.120
likely you're going to find
the relationships that are really there.

91
00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.780
Some other reasons that people
have trouble doing these analysis.

92
00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.499
You're measuring the wrong attributes.

93
00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.700
Again, customer satisfaction.

94
00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.410
You can ask me do I like the facility.

95
00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.330
Well, I could answer that,
but that's not a question

96
00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.760
that has anything to do with whether
I'm going to come back or not.

97
00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.500
So you have to make sure, again, when
you do the analysis, when you have these

98
00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.930
measures, are you measuring things
that actually impact behaviors?

99
00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:50.539
So again, that's peeling back the onion.

100
00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.180
Some other problems are really
organizational right?

101
00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.880
Those are really kind of, are your
measures good are your measures bad.

102
00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:03.610
Some of it is the fact that it's not
that we don't do analytics in companies.

103
00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:04.930
We do analytics.

104
00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.940
Some's more rigorous than others,
but we do it in little pockets, or

105
00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.129
as we call them islands of analysis for
strategy silos.

106
00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.030
Everybody's doing their own little
analysis, the marketing guys,

107
00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:19.160
the strategy guys, the operations people,
nobody ever talks to each other.

108
00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.160
You're all making action plans
based on your own analysis.

109
00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.650
And don't look at how
are they interdependent, or

110
00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:27.330
even how does one analysis in
one part of your department,

111
00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.360
impact analysis done by the other
part of the department.

112
00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.280
Again, strategy is trying to
tie all this stuff together, so

113
00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.640
you need to think about
how can we do this?

114
00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:41.290
The other thing is, you need to figure out
what is your intuition in the first place.

115
00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.520
You may not know this, or think about
this, but you do have hypotheses about

116
00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.840
what's going to make your company work,
that's called strategy.

117
00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.522
Right.
You do have intuition that if this

118
00:05:51.522 --> 00:05:54.040
happens, I think something
else is going to happen, but

119
00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.150
in a lot of cases we never
actually write that down.

120
00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:58.356
Well, to do the analytics and

121
00:05:58.356 --> 00:06:02.860
to figure out which model I estimate,
you should write down, what is intuition.

122
00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:04.990
What do we think is driving success?

123
00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:06.760
What are our hypotheses here.

124
00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:10.890
Spend the time upfront trying to figure
out what are the relationships you want to

125
00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:13.778
test, before you just start going off and
doing the statistics on this.

126
00:06:13.778 --> 00:06:20.060
Another problem, is as companies say
we have lots of data, no information.

127
00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.090
Data's really not a problem,
think about most companies,

128
00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:24.010
we got more data then we
know what to do with.

129
00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:26.600
It's getting even worse now,
because storage costs are so low.

130
00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.490
We save everything.

131
00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:32.920
But what you need again, are the resources
that the appropriate skills sets to

132
00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:36.400
actually analyze it,
to turn data in the information.

133
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.910
Now skills sets does not mean you've
got always great statisticians,

134
00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:41.250
yes you need that.

135
00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:44.145
The other thing you need though,
is the business people that tell us

136
00:06:44.145 --> 00:06:48.510
statisticians, here's what we need to
estimate or here's what we need to know.

137
00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:51.706
Because ultimately the predictive
analytics need to be turned into

138
00:06:51.706 --> 00:06:53.190
action plans.

139
00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:56.200
And that's where it requires
some mix of business skills and

140
00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:58.470
statistical skills on there.

141
00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:01.000
The other thing is you need to
dedicate resources to this.

142
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.910
Its not like most of us have time in
our day to actually do analytics.

143
00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:06.560
Where are the resources going to go, and

144
00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:12.740
do that Ideally what you'd like to do up
front, is what I call proof of concept.

145
00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:18.120
Pick off a small analytics project,
do it, show that it works.

146
00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:21.240
Pick an area where you're pretty
sure I can learn a lot on this.

147
00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:21.920
And once you do that,

148
00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.500
you're going to start getting
the resources committed to it.

149
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:27.920
Instead of saying, I'm going to analyze
the whole company in one big fell swoop,

150
00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:32.300
start out small, learn how to do it and
show proof of concept.

151
00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:34.460
We have the other issue
which is technology.

152
00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:38.550
You could have the greatest data base
in the world, okay, we went out and

153
00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:42.380
we bought Oracle, we bought SAP,
we have a relational data base.

154
00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:47.060
That in theory all the data supposed
to be in this relational database.

155
00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:47.730
In theory.

156
00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:49.930
In practice,

157
00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:54.440
though, how you can actually access
the data depends on how you coded it.

158
00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:56.410
Okay.
And here's

159
00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:58.500
the problem I've had in companies.

160
00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:03.540
You get in there and they say, we want to
link up employees to customers to

161
00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:06.930
did the clients decide
to keep our contract?

162
00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:09.410
So that's fine, you've got date on
the client, did they renew or not.

163
00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:11.310
Right?

164
00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:13.780
You got data on customer
satisfaction stuff.

165
00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:14.912
You got data on employees.

166
00:08:14.912 --> 00:08:17.940
Well it turns out the employees stuff
was never coded up to the client level,

167
00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:19.970
so I can't match that up.

168
00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:23.660
The customer satisfaction thing was for
the whole company, but you have 14

169
00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:27.140
different projects with that company and
they're only doing one at a time.

170
00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:29.760
You need to think in advance.

171
00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:32.810
How are you going to code the data
before it goes into the database?

172
00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:34.850
And think forward, think about four,

173
00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:38.370
five years from now,
I may want to do analytics.

174
00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:42.040
Make it as granular as possible
when you put it into the database.

175
00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:45.020
You can always roll things up,
you can never roll it back down.

176
00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:50.500
The other thing you should check on is,
when somebody says it's something like

177
00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:54.400
defect rates,
are they defining it the same way?

178
00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:59.050
We've gone in the companies where you,
and here's an example from an auto plant.

179
00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:01.690
Two different auto plants
in the same company,

180
00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:03.900
each one defined defects differently.

181
00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:07.460
So trying to match those up when they
didn't even find defects the same way,

182
00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:09.320
that's going to be hard to do.

183
00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.930
So that's a problem that you have on this.

184
00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:12.780
Another big problem,

185
00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:16.480
remember ultimately we're trying
to predict financial outcomes.

186
00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:17.130
The problem is,

187
00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:19.730
most of your financial data is going to
come out of your accounting system.

188
00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:23.850
Some of the outcomes that you
want to predict are not things that

189
00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:25.580
naturally come out of
an accounting system.

190
00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:29.500
And one good one would be
customer profitability.

191
00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:33.270
Not how profitable the product is,
not how profitable division is.

192
00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:36.210
For this customer,
am I making money on that customer or not?

193
00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:40.660
Well, that's not naturally a way we
gather data in an accounting system.

194
00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:43.830
So, until you can start actually
gathering that financial data that way,

195
00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:46.440
it's going to be hard to
predict the model you want.

196
00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:48.620
Now, maybe the case you say,
I want to do this in the future,

197
00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:51.120
we start tracking it that way.

198
00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.740
But that isn't limitation.

199
00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:55.300
Finally, politics is everywhere.

200
00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:59.950
Okay, you need to worry
about things data fiefdoms.

201
00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:02.740
Data is strength.

202
00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:04.670
Different parts of companies
don't like giving up data.

203
00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:08.700
How can you get different
functions to start sharing?

204
00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:13.270
To actually do this analytics,
linking non financials to financials.

205
00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:16.090
I need the finance people, the marketing
people, the operations people,

206
00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:18.110
to start sharing data.

207
00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:19.950
This is not always very easy.

208
00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:23.570
We've had companies where we've had to go
to the very highest levels of the C suite

209
00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:25.670
to actually get different
functions to share the data.

210
00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:30.810
The other one is, what do you do if you're
intuition doesn't appear to be true?

211
00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:34.219
Here's somebody's who's made their
career based on their intuition.

212
00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:38.950
And now you tell them, hey look,
maybe that intuition's not right.

213
00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:39.950
Right.

214
00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:41.940
A lot of people don't
want to know the answer.

215
00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:44.140
I've staked my career
on this relationship.

216
00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:44.780
It better be there.

217
00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:47.880
All you can do is either show me I'm
right, which I already know I'm right,

218
00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:50.710
or you're going to tell me I'm wrong,
which I don't want to know.

219
00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:54.090
I do not want to know the issue,
the answer to this thing.

220
00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:56.520
You've got to worry a bit
about the politics upfront.

221
00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:58.220
And the organizational power issues.

222
00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:01.800
Is this going to shift when you start
saying the money should be invested here

223
00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:03.390
versus there?

224
00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:05.040
What's going to happen?

225
00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:08.600
So given those issues,
this can be a little tricky, but

226
00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:09.590
it doesn't really matter.

227
00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:11.280
I mean,
ultimately this is where it's going.

228
00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:13.760
We are going to start analytics,
like it or not.

229
00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:16.239
You need to at least think
about the politics up front.

230
00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:18.730
But ultimately we're going to do it.

231
00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:21.670
So here to conclude,
here's the key questions you want to ask.

232
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.760
First, what's the firm's business
model in the first place?

233
00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:29.610
Forget the analytics,
start out with your strategic plan, right?

234
00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:33.520
Start asking yourself how
specifically is this company or

235
00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:36.730
this business unit expected to
create value for our organization?

236
00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:41.230
Specifically lay out that
causal business model.

237
00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:44.250
How is it that A is expected to lead to B,
is expected to lead to C?

238
00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:50.920
Now, once you've done that, now you can if
that's the model I want to test, what data

239
00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:54.700
do we have that are currently available
to test these value propositions?

240
00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:57.730
Well as I said,
most companies data is not a problem.

241
00:11:57.730 --> 00:11:59.390
Information is.

242
00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:01.590
My recommendation is,
don't reinvent the wheel.

243
00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:02.930
Don't start tracking new data.

244
00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:06.640
Try to find data that you currently have
in the organization that's close enough to

245
00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:09.990
what you need, and
start testing these relationships.

246
00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:12.740
Don't start gathering new data, because
there's probably some there already.

247
00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:18.130
Ask yourself, what is the desired
economic outcome you care about?

248
00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:19.720
It doesn't have to be profits.

249
00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:22.320
It could be revenues,
it could be revenue growth.

250
00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:24.940
It could be if you look at contracts,
did we win the contract,

251
00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:26.290
did we not win the contract.

252
00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:28.410
It could be retention rates.

253
00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:30.230
What are the economic outcomes?

254
00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:33.990
And based on that, you can start gathering
the data and doing the analysis on this.

255
00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:39.680
A really big question to ask yourself,
what's the appropriate unit of analysis?

256
00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:40.920
It may not be the whole firm.

257
00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:43.950
In fact it may be very hard to
do this at the firm, right.

258
00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:46.890
Is it an office, is it a plant, a region?

259
00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:49.870
Right, as you've seen in other videos,

260
00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:51.880
it could be customers where
we do customer analytics.

261
00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:54.510
It could be a product or
service a program or initiative.

262
00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:57.900
Figure out for
the analysis you're trying to do,

263
00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:00.940
what is the appropriate
unit of analysis there.

264
00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:02.700
It doesn't have to be low level customers,

265
00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:05.600
it doesn't have to be
the whole company in total.

266
00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:09.250
So given the analytics in which you
want to answer, that could change.

267
00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:13.180
And finally, you would like to make this
an ongoing process, not we did it once,

268
00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:15.070
here's the answer we got.

269
00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:19.950
Strategies change, competitors change,
the business world changes.

270
00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:23.900
You need to keep doing the analytics to
say, does this relationship still exist?

271
00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:26.900
How is it that you can set up
an organizational mechanism,

272
00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:29.820
to ensure that you have this
ongoing analysis to include,

273
00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:32.250
let me give you an example of
what some companies are doing.

274
00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:38.320
What they do is set up quarterly meetings
with all their high level executives.

275
00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:42.640
In each one of those meetings
they lay out some hypothesis

276
00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:44.789
that we would like tested for
the next meeting.

277
00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:48.890
Then the analytics group goes off and
they test these hypotheses,

278
00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:50.930
they present the results
in the next quarter.

279
00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:54.400
I guarantee you that when
you present the results,

280
00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.910
a whole bunch of new
questions start coming up,

281
00:13:56.910 --> 00:14:01.010
which lead to the next test of hypotheses
that we're going to do on there.

282
00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:06.010
And by doing that, you've got an ongoing
mechanism of updating the results.

283
00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:09.070
And again, peeling back this onion til
you get to the point where you can start

284
00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:10.620
answering these questions and

285
00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:15.040
ensuring this predictive analytics
becomes embedded in your company.

286
00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:19.470
As opposed to becoming a just one
off exercise that you're going to

287
00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:22.180
do maybe this year, maybe next year.

288
00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:24.640
No.
This is an ongoing process as the world

289
00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:26.080
changes faster and faster.

290
00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:28.069
You need to set up an ongoing mechanism.

291
00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:32.420
And with that, I'd like to thank you for
listening to this, and I

292
00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:36.150
hope you can take some of the things I've
taught here and use it in your companies.

293
00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:39.652
Because predictive analytics can be
incredibly powerful tool, both for

294
00:14:39.652 --> 00:14:42.871
figuring out how your strategy is working,
and more importantly,

295
00:14:42.871 --> 00:14:46.709
figuring out what's the biggest financial
payback when you start linking these

296
00:14:46.709 --> 00:14:49.330
non-financial measures to
the financial measures.
