1
00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.147
Okay, the second step in the process
is actually setting targets for

2
00:00:03.147 --> 00:00:04.311
these non-financial measures.

3
00:00:04.311 --> 00:00:06.985
Now you hear a lot of
times that more is better,

4
00:00:06.985 --> 00:00:11.733
100% of your employees or customers
need to be satisfied, which may be true.

5
00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:14.090
But in a lot of cases it may not be true.

6
00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.070
Again, it's not the same as a financial
metric where more money and

7
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.650
more profits is always preferred, right?

8
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.210
The problem is the companies we talked to
they have considerable difficulty setting

9
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.950
goals for any of these non-financial
performance measures and

10
00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:28.190
there's a number of reasons for this.

11
00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.950
One, what do you do when the measures
have no common denominator, okay?

12
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.370
This is not like financial results, I know
how to do a budget because everything

13
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.360
rolls up from the bottom to the top
because everything's in common currency.

14
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.690
How do I compare a 10% decrease in
customer complaints to a 3% reduction in

15
00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.160
defect rates?

16
00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.300
They're completely different,

17
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.770
so if I wanted to say which one
makes more sense well I gotta

18
00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.570
put them in a common denominator
which just happens to be currency.

19
00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.590
Which is why we're going to link this to
financial performance because it's going

20
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.720
to allow us to kind of make tradeoffs.

21
00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.070
The other big problem is, you got these
non linear functional relationships and

22
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.210
tradeoffs.

23
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.170
What that means is,

24
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.100
you can have either economies of scale or
diseconomies of scale, right.

25
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.590
More is not necessarily better.

26
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.630
I probably do not want
100% satisfied customers.

27
00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.530
The reason is it's really expensive.

28
00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.710
And ultimately if what I'm trying to
do is optimize financial performance,

29
00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.870
that may not be the right thing to do.

30
00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:25.780
Same thing with employee turnover.

31
00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.950
Well yeah employee turnover
is very expensive.

32
00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.690
But it'd be expensive to keep people, and

33
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.620
in truth a lot of companies
actually want some turnover

34
00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:38.110
because it creates new opportunities for
people to move up in the organization.

35
00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.990
It brings in new world views, so

36
00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.960
you probably don't want
zero employee turnover.

37
00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.960
You probably don't want
100% satisfied customers.

38
00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.830
The question is where's this
point of diminishing returns and

39
00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.920
how can we figure out where that's at?

40
00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.770
So let's go through an example of this.

41
00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.460
Okay, here's a personal
computer manufacturer.

42
00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.590
It turns out the margins on
a personal computer are very small.

43
00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.270
You do not make much money
on each personal computer.

44
00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.990
The other thing with a personal
computer is you don't necessarily buy

45
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:11.310
one every year.

46
00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.180
So there could be a lag
between me being satisfied and

47
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.840
me deciding whether I'm going
to buy from them again.

48
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:16.840
On the other hand,

49
00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.740
if you don't like your personal computer,
I'd bet you'd tell somebody.

50
00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.780
So you've got this whole
issue with word of mouth.

51
00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.860
So here are some hypotheses in the
business model of this PC manufacturer.

52
00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.475
One is more satisfied customers recommend
the company's products to others.

53
00:02:32.475 --> 00:02:34.140
It's also called positive word of mouth.

54
00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.820
Dissatisfied customers complain
to others about the product or

55
00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.250
negative word of mouth.

56
00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.760
Turns out they've done studies in the auto
industry, if you really like your car,

57
00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.120
you tell one person.

58
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.460
If you really do not like
your car you tell 10.

59
00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:50.750
So it turns out negative word of mouth can
be worse than the positive word of mouth

60
00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.660
and especially in a business like this
where you do not necessarily buy a PC

61
00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.150
every year.

62
00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.110
The word-of-mouth may be that the direct
relationship in a lot of cases between

63
00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:05.130
improving satisfaction and
short-term financial performance.

64
00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.760
Okay?

65
00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.870
So here are the hypotheses we can test.

66
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.040
Greater positive word-of-mouth
increases future financial performance.

67
00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.810
Greater negative word-of-mouth
reduces future financial performance.

68
00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.820
That's what they're hypothesizing.

69
00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.980
So if you believe that,
what are you gonna do?

70
00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.170
Spend money to increase satisfaction

71
00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.790
because that should change
your word of mouth.

72
00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.110
So here's what they did when they
actually went back and looked at this.

73
00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.300
So what you have here, if you think
about when you buy a personal computer,

74
00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:33.339
you have a warranty card.

75
00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:35.180
You fill that out.

76
00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.490
They kinda know who you are as long
as you filled out the warranty card.

77
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.860
And what you're trying to do with
a lot of these non-financials,

78
00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.220
see if they are leading indicators
of future financial performance.

79
00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.260
If I know something
about satisfaction now,

80
00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.900
does it tell me something about
future financial performance?

81
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.710
Now remember,
one of their hypotheses is if

82
00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:58.610
I have higher customer satisfaction, I'm
gonna tell more people that I liked it,

83
00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.040
more positive word of mouth and
vice versa.

84
00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.040
Well their satisfaction scale, like a lot
of companies, it's on a five point scale.

85
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.870
Five is I'm really satisfied,
one is I'm not really satisfied.

86
00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.020
So when you do the analytics,
here's what you find.

87
00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.740
First of all, we're gonna start
off with a positive word of mouth.

88
00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:21.460
Obviously, if I don't like it,
I don't give any positive word of mouth.

89
00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.200
If I don't like it, but not quite
extremely bad, if I give it a two,

90
00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.220
which is that second red bar there,
I might say something.

91
00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.200
After I get three, I'm kind of satisfied,
from three to five.

92
00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.030
Yeah, I recommend it, but

93
00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.890
if you look at that,
those lines aren't that much different.

94
00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:40.700
In fact,
they go down a little bit if anything, but

95
00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.320
they're statistically the same.

96
00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:47.370
Basically, what this says is if
I'm moderately satisfied right?

97
00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:48.170
I recommend it.

98
00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:50.750
After that, I could spend money
making you more satisfied but

99
00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.710
you don't recommend any more
than you would've otherwise.

100
00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.090
Now, here's why this is important.

101
00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:56.820
The company had a bonus plan.

102
00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:01.585
The bonus plan said maximize the number
of people that give us a five for

103
00:05:01.585 --> 00:05:02.945
customer satisfaction.

104
00:05:02.945 --> 00:05:04.565
It's called a top box measure.

105
00:05:04.565 --> 00:05:07.265
What percentage of the people
answer in the top box of

106
00:05:07.265 --> 00:05:09.115
the customer satisfaction scale?

107
00:05:09.115 --> 00:05:11.245
Very common bonus plan.

108
00:05:11.245 --> 00:05:15.385
Well if I was the manager and that's
the bonus you gave me, all those people in

109
00:05:15.385 --> 00:05:19.510
three and four I would try to get them
into five cuz you're going to pay me more.

110
00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:24.070
But looking at this, I'm spending money
to get them into the five bucket but

111
00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:25.500
they're not recommending any more.

112
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.340
It may not make it any economic sense.

113
00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:29.240
Let's go to the down side.

114
00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:33.630
Exactly opposite.

115
00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:35.810
Okay, if you look at negative
word of mouth, obviously,

116
00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:37.910
if you don't like it you tell people.

117
00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:40.630
From three on you get
the exact same answer here.

118
00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:44.339
So one of the big issues
that comes out of this is,

119
00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:47.080
how do you want to set
your performance targets?

120
00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.480
Now remember the target here
was get everybody on five.

121
00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.030
Over to the right on the bar.

122
00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.790
That means get anybody on those threes and
fours, push them up.

123
00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:00.120
Well what this may say is that's
really not a very good target.

124
00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:04.110
Now I've asked a lot of
students when I presented this,

125
00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:05.250
where would you set the target?

126
00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:06.400
And a lot of times they respond,

127
00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.130
oh why don't we set it at three, because
that kind of seems like the hot spot.

128
00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:11.510
Well in truth, that's not right.

129
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:15.920
What you really want to do is set
the target such that nobody gets into one.

130
00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.040
That's where the biggest bang for
the buck is.

131
00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:20.620
Get everybody out of the one category.

132
00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:23.020
Targets do not have to be set
at the top of the scales.

133
00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:24.570
We seem to think that
that's where it has to be.

134
00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:26.230
Get everybody up at the top.

135
00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:28.020
No, get everybody out of the bottom.

136
00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:30.280
And the only way you
would have known that for

137
00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.610
setting this target is to
actually do the analytics on it.

138
00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:34.390
Let's actually go back,

139
00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:38.290
test that prediction that if I
have more satisfied customers.

140
00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:40.750
In the future they will
recommend my product and

141
00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:42.650
that's gonna lead to better
financial performance.

142
00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:50.560
Okay, now this need not be true so
here's an opposite example.

143
00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.370
Okay, this is a company,
a financial company

144
00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:55.920
where you're gonna invest your
money with an investment advisor.

145
00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.810
Say you got your retirement fund and
I wanna invest it there.

146
00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:02.980
What they wanted to look at was is there a
relationship between satisfaction with our

147
00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:06.500
firm and future financial performance.

148
00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:08.230
Well, we did the analysis and guess what?

149
00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:11.050
We found absolutely zero.

150
00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:14.560
There was no relationship between
satisfaction with the firm and

151
00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:15.320
firm performance.

152
00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:21.730
What you did find was that satisfaction
with your investment advisor.

153
00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:24.430
This is where you have to figure
out what the right measures are.

154
00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:27.250
It's not just I'm satisfied with the firm,
right.

155
00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:30.900
I don't care about your research reports,
I don't care about your offices.

156
00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:34.650
If I'm satisfied with my
individual investment officer,

157
00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:36.620
then I tend to give you more money.

158
00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:40.880
Now the thing you care about in an
industry like this is assets invested or

159
00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:43.340
what's also called
assets under management.

160
00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:44.500
I want all your portfolio.

161
00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.240
Give it all to me because I make money
on how much money I'm investing.

162
00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:53.370
So when you start looking at this,
you see a relationship

163
00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:57.690
between investor, advisor satisfaction,
and assets invested.

164
00:07:57.690 --> 00:07:59.690
Where they have an index
that has many things in it.

165
00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:00.550
So here's low.

166
00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:04.690
The scale range is from one is I'm
really not satisfied with my advisor.

167
00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:06.200
To seven I'm very satisfied.

168
00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.060
So here's the low end.

169
00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:13.050
Well It does start actually going up,
right?

170
00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:16.380
As you're more satisfied you
start investing more there.

171
00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:19.210
We're not seeing that diminishing
returns that we saw with

172
00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:21.143
the computer manufacturer now though.

173
00:08:26.054 --> 00:08:30.464
Here's an example where you do wanna
spend money to get them as satisfied as

174
00:08:30.464 --> 00:08:31.170
possible.

175
00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:35.270
There is a huge jump
here in how satisfied you

176
00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:38.330
are with your investment advisor and
assets under management.

177
00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:40.270
This is after controlling for
how much money you made.

178
00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:42.180
So this just not they made
a lot of money for you.

179
00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:46.910
This is one where you get
exactly the opposite result

180
00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:50.070
from what we had with the personal
computer manufacturer.

181
00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:52.430
There it was,
no don't put people in the four's and

182
00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:55.950
five's because after three
it makes no difference.

183
00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:57.780
Here's one where it's exactly opposite.

184
00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:01.790
You get a huge jump between six and seven.

185
00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:07.810
So investing, and trying to improve
investor advisor satisfaction,

186
00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:11.560
would seem to make a huge difference here,
as opposed to the other one, and

187
00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:12.980
that's where you need to do analytics.

188
00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:15.700
Don't let anybody tell you they know.

189
00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:18.380
What's gonna happen to these
relationships without trying to test it?

190
00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:25.370
So here's an example of trying to do the
same analysis using external market data.

191
00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:28.590
It turns out that there's something called
the American Customer Satisfaction Index.

192
00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:32.500
What happens is the University
of Michigan goes out and

193
00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:35.490
surveys customers on their
use of various products.

194
00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:38.730
And this is all published in one of
the major business publications.

195
00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:39.690
So this is gonna come out.

196
00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:41.410
The question is when this comes out,

197
00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:45.580
does the market actually respond
to these satisfaction index?

198
00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:47.610
Right?
Do they believe that if a company has very

199
00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:51.180
good satisfaction, they're gonna have
future cash flows that are higher?

200
00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:53.500
If they're bad is it gonna be lower?

201
00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:56.590
Now, this is done in many countries,
including many countries in Europe.

202
00:09:56.590 --> 00:09:59.140
So there is a lot of work on this.

203
00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:01.890
Now what we're showing here is,
what happens to

204
00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:06.040
the valuation of your company depending on
what your customer satisfaction level is?

205
00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:08.470
This is after controlling for
your accounting book values.

206
00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:12.650
So is your company worth more than
your accounting book values would say?

207
00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:15.140
Based on what kind of
satisfaction you have.

208
00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:17.420
Well, again if you look at the bottom,
of the quartile one.

209
00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:23.730
Yeah, if you have fairly low customer
satisfaction based on this index,

210
00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:25.410
your market value is gonna be lower.

211
00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:29.770
It goes up when you go into quartile two,
better satisfaction, but again,

212
00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:31.670
look at three and four.

213
00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:36.020
Even the stock market believes that
more is not necessarily better.

214
00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:39.940
After you've kind of met, got into the top
end of the customer satisfaction index

215
00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:42.450
the market is not rewarding you

216
00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:47.180
with higher market value based on your
customer satisfaction scores on this.

217
00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:50.185
Now again if you look at what
happened to your stock returns.

218
00:10:50.185 --> 00:10:54.540
When this was announced, did the markets
say, okay, now I know something about your

219
00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:58.306
satisfaction, I'm going to hurt your
stock price today or increase it.

220
00:10:58.306 --> 00:11:01.818
This is looking over 10 days and it's
called excess returns because we're taking

221
00:11:01.818 --> 00:11:05.850
out what happened in the stock market and
your industry and things like that.

222
00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:07.950
They really hammered you.

223
00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:10.290
If you were in the bottom of
the customer satisfaction index,

224
00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:15.010
your stock price went down 2% over
10 days, which is pretty big.

225
00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:19.540
You look at two and three,
it went up, but fairly small amounts.

226
00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:22.870
But here in terms of the stock returns,

227
00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:27.230
not the valuation, the market did reward
you for being on the top end here.

228
00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:30.290
Now it turns out this actually
differs depending on the industry.

229
00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:33.730
The one industry where you
do not see this was retail.

230
00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:38.630
And in retail, what you've found
was that in quartile four.

231
00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:40.130
The top one.

232
00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:41.920
It actually was negative.

233
00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:44.060
You say well oh that makes no sense.

234
00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:45.789
Until you start thinking about retail.

235
00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:51.410
Think of the high end retailers with
very high customer satisfaction scores.

236
00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:53.590
In the United States it's
something like Nordstroms.

237
00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:57.360
You can go in there and
there's a guy playing the piano.

238
00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:00.710
I don't go in to stores because they're
playing pianos but some people do.

239
00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:03.820
There's apocryphal stories of
Nordstroms will take anything back.

240
00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:07.100
So they've taken back tires,
they do not sell tires.

241
00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:09.190
They've got very satisfied customers.

242
00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:12.810
What the market believes though
is they've gone a little crazy.

243
00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:15.050
They're just too satisfied,
you're spending too much money and

244
00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:16.400
it's just not paying off.

245
00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:21.040
So again, what you wanna do is, even if
you're gonna look externally, make sure

246
00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:24.730
you kinda slice and dice the analytics
to see does this hold across everybody.

247
00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:26.720
Does it vary by location?

248
00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:31.600
Does it vary by country,
does it vary by which industry you're in?

249
00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:35.560
Cuz it turns out if you've got
Chinese speaking customers

250
00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:38.760
they answer on a different part of
the customer satisfaction scale.

251
00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:41.640
So you need to control for that.

252
00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:43.920
So if I'm trying to pool
Chinese customers and

253
00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:48.450
non Chinese customers your
statistics are gonna show nothing.

254
00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:49.800
What you need to realize is,

255
00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:53.400
you gotta estimate separate models with
Chinese-speaking people, and non-Chinese.

256
00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:54.780
It's not a bias.

257
00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:57.260
It's just you tend to answer on
a different part of a scale.
