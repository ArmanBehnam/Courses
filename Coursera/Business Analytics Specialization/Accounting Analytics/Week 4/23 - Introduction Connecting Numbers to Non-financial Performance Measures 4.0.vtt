00:00:05.308 --> 00:00:08.528
Hello, I'm Christ Ittner, an EY professor
of accounting at Wharton where I

2
00:00:08.528 --> 00:00:12.250
specialized in Management Accounting and
Performance Measurement issues.

3
00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:14.710
Welcome to week four of
accounting analytics.

4
00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:15.320
The topic for

5
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.420
week four is linking non-financial
metrics to financial performance.

6
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.490
And then the next lecture will
start to dig in into that subject.

7
00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.060
Before we get started on the substance,

8
00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.620
I want to briefly explain how this topic
fits with and complements what you've

9
00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:29.664
learned from Professor Boucher
in weeks one, two, and three.

10
00:00:29.664 --> 00:00:32.590
Professor Boucher went over some
accounting fundamentals and

11
00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.790
then delved into different techniques
such as ratio analysis and

12
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.280
fraud detection, that you can use to
analyze a company's financial reports and

13
00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.830
make conclusions about that company's
financial health, outlook, and

14
00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.390
the extent to which the results might
have been managed or manipulated.

15
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.270
These techniques taking external
perspective and focus on the numbers.

16
00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.700
What are the publicly reported financial
reports telling us about this company?

17
00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.516
I'm going to shift a bit to a different
perspective and talk about how do you go

18
00:00:58.516 --> 00:01:02.652
beyond accounting numbers with analytical
mindset to predict financial outcomes?

19
00:01:02.652 --> 00:01:05.772
It's either a manager or
an external financial statement users,

20
00:01:05.772 --> 00:01:09.394
what are the key non-financial performance
measures you can use to forecast

21
00:01:09.394 --> 00:01:11.080
a firms future financial results?

22
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.920
When thinking about accounting analytics,

23
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.350
it's important to have an understanding
of both of these perspectives.

24
00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.170
From an external firm valuation
standpoint, the ultimate goal is assessing

25
00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.940
a companies financial viability and
long-run financial prospects.

26
00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.980
Any information that can help you predict
these outcomes should be incorporated in

27
00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:28.816
the analysis.

28
00:01:28.816 --> 00:01:32.740
Although Professor Boucher emphasized
the use of publicly available financial

29
00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.760
reports, value relevant information may or
may not come from financial statements.

30
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.780
For example, if a company suffers a
dramatic decline in customer satisfaction,

31
00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.370
it's likely the company's
ongoing financial viability and

32
00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.899
prospects will also decline
dramatically in the future.

33
00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.120
Unfortunately, customer satisfaction
information is not included in financial

34
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.670
statements.

35
00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.040
It just be gathered from other sources.

36
00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.400
External financial statement users
should take this type of non-financial

37
00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.640
information into account when conducting
the analyses covered in weeks

38
00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.140
one to three.

39
00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.310
More importantly, accounting analytics
is not limited to methods for

40
00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.840
external financial statement
users to evaluate companies.

41
00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.010
For an internal decision
making standpoint,

42
00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:12.955
managers must decide which financial and

43
00:02:12.955 --> 00:02:17.320
non-financial actions to take in order to
increase the company's long term value.

44
00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.110
For example, would the company be better
off spending money on reducing defects or

45
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.290
increasing customer satisfaction
with the sales process?

46
00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.628
When measuring a manager or business
unit's performance, which financial and

47
00:02:27.628 --> 00:02:31.010
non-financial performance measures
actually tells us where at the managers

48
00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.070
are taking actions that actually improved
long term financial performance.

49
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.010
Like the external analysis
covering week's one to three,

50
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.187
the goal of internally focus accounting
analytics is using any available financial

51
00:02:42.187 --> 00:02:46.306
and non-financial information to predict
the drivers of financial viability and

52
00:02:46.306 --> 00:02:47.745
future financial outcome.

53
00:02:47.745 --> 00:02:50.570
That's why these ideas are presented
together in this course and

54
00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.807
I look forward to talking about linking
non financial metrics to financial

55
00:02:53.807 --> 00:02:56.090
performance in the following lectures.

56
00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.818
Let's get started.
