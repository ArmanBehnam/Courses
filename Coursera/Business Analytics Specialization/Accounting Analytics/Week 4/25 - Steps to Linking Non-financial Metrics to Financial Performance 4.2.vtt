00:00:05.903 --> 00:00:10.458
So let's go through some of the steps on
linking nonfinancial metrics to financial

2
00:00:10.458 --> 00:00:11.310
performance.

3
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:13.740
Again, here's some fundamental questions.

4
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.670
We're going to have this
causal business model.

5
00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:18.610
So the first question is, to what extent
does this business model actually

6
00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:21.690
incorporate the right
drivers of financial success?

7
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:23.260
Obviously, they're predictions.

8
00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:24.350
That's what a strategy is.

9
00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:25.620
It says if I do this,

10
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.890
this is how I think financial performance
is actually going to end up happening.

11
00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.170
Do we have the right measures in there?

12
00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.600
Again, you could have a measure
that you think is good,

13
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.900
it just doesn't capture what you
think it's capturing on this.

14
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.130
The second is,

15
00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.480
given that now that I've got this business
model I think I have some measures

16
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.410
that I want to use, how can I use that
business model to allocate resources?

17
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.570
because ultimately,
that's what we need to do.

18
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.390
Now, allocation resources could come
through, I said, budget's based on this.

19
00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.960
It could come simply because this is
how I'm going to evaluate managers, and

20
00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.340
if I evaluate you on something,
that's what you're going to give me.

21
00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.280
I don't specifically have
to tell you what to do, and

22
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.910
finally as I've said before, we have
to worry about how we set targets for

23
00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.130
these measures, which is going to be
one of the most difficult problems

24
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.650
that we have with nonfinancial measures
because more is not necessarily better.

25
00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.630
So let's start with Step 1,
Identifying the Right Drivers.

26
00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:17.401
So here's the steps.

27
00:01:17.401 --> 00:01:20.447
We're going to develop this causal
business model, first of all again,

28
00:01:20.447 --> 00:01:22.960
it has to be linked to
organizational strategy.

29
00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.590
What are you trying to achieve?

30
00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.900
What the causal business model
is trying to do is saying,

31
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.780
here's what I'd like to achieve,
what are the steps that I need to take

32
00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.120
to successfully implement this strategy,
see if it works, and

33
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.380
see if ultimately it leads to financial
performance, and the way we're going to do

34
00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.709
that is we're going to articulate
these hypothesized drivers.

35
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.180
This causal thing.

36
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.120
A leads to B leads to C,
those are hypothesis.

37
00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.560
For each one of those A, Bs and

38
00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.300
Cs we're going to come up with financial
or nonfinancial performance measures and

39
00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.860
see if ultimately do they translate
through the way we think it's going to.

40
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.960
Second thing we have to do is
construct what are called reliable and

41
00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.380
valid measures of the key drivers.

42
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.590
Basically, do these measures pick up
what you think they're picking up?

43
00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.940
Our strategy says, do A, do B, do C.

44
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.560
The question is, how do I measure A?

45
00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.782
Again, this is not always such
an easy thing to do on this.

46
00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.270
So here's a little pop quiz.

47
00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.560
You think about fast food hamburger
chains in the United States.

48
00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.540
There's lots of ways I could evaluate
are you satisfied with the fast food

49
00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:33.170
hamburger chain.

50
00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.060
I could say is it the quality
to the hamburgers?

51
00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.590
I could say is it the cleanliness?

52
00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.690
I could say is it how easy is it to
get in and out of the parking lot?

53
00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.620
And if you think about most customer
satisfaction surveys you've seen,

54
00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.530
they ask you a whole bunch of questions.

55
00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.300
Well, I can answer all of those.

56
00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.790
But what I really want to know as
a company is not just are you satisfied,

57
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.060
are you satisfied on a dimension that's
going to make you come back and buy more?

58
00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:58.660
And that's the key thing.

59
00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.253
Well, it turns out, for fast food
hamburger chains in the United States and

60
00:03:02.253 --> 00:03:06.091
some research we've done, the quality
of the hamburger is actually quite low.

61
00:03:06.091 --> 00:03:09.080
Now, it turns out the quality of
the french fries is really important.

62
00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.830
But it has very little predictive ability
of whether you're going to come back.

63
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.233
Number one, and only those of you who have
small children are going to understand

64
00:03:17.233 --> 00:03:21.566
this, the number one predictor of whether
somebody says they're going to come back

65
00:03:21.566 --> 00:03:25.620
is, was their child happy with the toy
in the happy last time you went there?

66
00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.741
because as you're going to realize once
you have small children the only time you

67
00:03:28.741 --> 00:03:30.820
go out for
fast food is when your kids want you to.

68
00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:33.180
Now, if you think about that,

69
00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.770
if I ask you something about
did you like the hamburger?

70
00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:39.520
And I'm using that to evaluate managers,
they're going to improve the quality of

71
00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.720
the hamburger but if that doesn't
cost you to come back and buy more.

72
00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.550
That's not a good strategy.

73
00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.510
So what we need are constructs,
or measures,

74
00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.330
that are reliable at capturing what you
think they're going to capture and valet.

75
00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.010
They are going to be predictive
of when you come back.

76
00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.490
The other thing that is what you want is
you don't want measures that bounce up and

77
00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:03.320
down all the time on this stuff and what
you get a lot of times with these measures

78
00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.100
is because you use like
very small sample sizes.

79
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.060
They bounce up and down.

80
00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.380
They don't actually tell you much.

81
00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.890
So what we want is a measure
that's valid and reliable.

82
00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.705
It predicts what you want it to predict.

83
00:04:12.705 --> 00:04:16.310
And it's not what's called too noisy,
which means it just bounces up and down.

84
00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.640
We don't know why on this.

85
00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:19.760
Next step.

86
00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.160
I got a causal business model.

87
00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.290
I had some constructs or

88
00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.620
measures that I think actually
capture the dimensions I care about.

89
00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.050
Let's verify the linkages.

90
00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.750
Let's see if it's actually true,
because again, we're guessing here.

91
00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.120
The strategic plan may be based
on your intuition or whatever.

92
00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.490
It is a hypothesis about how
things are going to work.

93
00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:44.580
Let's verify, if I said A should lead to
B should lead to C, let's verify this.

94
00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:50.410
Let's do some analytics on this to see
if these linkages that you hypothesized

95
00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:51.235
actually show up.

96
00:04:51.235 --> 00:04:55.287
But again, I want to know why, because
if they aren't either I gotta change my

97
00:04:55.287 --> 00:05:00.140
measures, change my strategy or figure out
what are the organizational barriers that

98
00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.147
are blocking this from happening.

99
00:05:02.147 --> 00:05:03.500
So here's an example.

100
00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.816
We got a major fast food chain.

101
00:05:06.816 --> 00:05:10.337
Company's got 6,000+ stores
in the united states and

102
00:05:10.337 --> 00:05:14.075
they offer both in store purchases,
they also offer delivery.

103
00:05:14.075 --> 00:05:18.548
Now, their overall profitability wasn't
growing fast enough to meet either their

104
00:05:18.548 --> 00:05:20.570
internal or external expectations.

105
00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:21.770
So like a lot-
>> Can you say

106
00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:22.474
that-
>> Yeah.

107
00:05:22.474 --> 00:05:25.104
>> [INAUDIBLE]
>> So their overall profitability was not

108
00:05:25.104 --> 00:05:28.830
growing enough to meet either their
internal or external expectations.

109
00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.980
Like a lot of companies this is public,
you've got the analysts saying here's

110
00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:34.840
an earnings per share
target that we have to hit.

111
00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:39.280
They weren't hitting that and they weren't
hitting their internal targets either.

112
00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.570
So what happens at a series of meeting,
we got the senior level executives,

113
00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:44.640
all the functional areas we're
going to get together and

114
00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.530
we're going to build
a consensus business model.

115
00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:48.800
We're going to actually
go through this process.

116
00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.302
Let's take our strategy,

117
00:05:50.302 --> 00:05:54.875
let's lay out what we think the consensus
business model is, and then we're going to

118
00:05:54.875 --> 00:05:59.013
come up with performance measures
based on the consensus business model.

119
00:05:59.013 --> 00:06:03.055
Now, like a lot of companies,
and even you in a lot of cases,

120
00:06:03.055 --> 00:06:05.290
you have to start out somewhere.

121
00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:09.440
So this consensus business model was
developed using management intuition.

122
00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.820
There really wasn't any
data analysis upfront.

123
00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.150
We've been in this fast
food business a long time.

124
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:17.190
We know our customers,
we know our competitive environment.

125
00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:22.030
Here's what we think it's going to
take to meet our financial objectives.

126
00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:24.260
So here's their Consensus Business Model.

127
00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:28.140
Well, they're going to use something
called the customer service profit chain,

128
00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:31.060
which is very common in retailers.

129
00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:35.415
The idea is, I've gotta start
out looking at my employees.

130
00:06:35.415 --> 00:06:38.575
So if I've got very good employees,
the idea is well,

131
00:06:38.575 --> 00:06:41.609
that is going to lead to
a better customer experience.

132
00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:45.700
If I get a better customer experience,
what's going to happen?

133
00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:47.210
Well, customers are going to buy more.

134
00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:48.180
They're going to come back.

135
00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:50.045
They're going to tell a friend.

136
00:06:50.045 --> 00:06:53.740
And ultimately, that is going to get
me the financial results that I was,

137
00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:58.640
which in their case was growth and
financial returns.

138
00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:01.710
Now, if you look at this,
there is actually no direct link

139
00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:06.570
between employee selection and
staffing, and financial performance.

140
00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:08.760
Lots of intermediate
things have to happen.

141
00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:13.070
So if I was just going to look at employee
selection and staffing and try to use

142
00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:17.410
predictive analytics to predict financial
results, it's going to be very difficult.

143
00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:20.830
There's too many other things
that are going to have to happen

144
00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:23.110
before you get that end result.

145
00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:26.910
The other thing is it's going to take
a while for this to actually go through

146
00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:30.680
between the hiring employees and actually
getting better financial performance.

147
00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:31.630
But in the interim,

148
00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:36.170
if I get better employees, that's going to
predict that there's more productive.

149
00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:39.338
The employees are going to add more value.

150
00:07:39.338 --> 00:07:41.440
If I got better employees
that are more productive and

151
00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:45.700
work harder, that's going to lead
to a better customer experience

152
00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:49.090
which ultimately is going to lead to
the financial performance they want.

153
00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:50.630
Now, again, think about this.

154
00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:54.210
It's a fast food company and
we've got delivery here.

155
00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:56.819
So to give you an example, let's say
you've got a pizza delivery company.

156
00:07:58.712 --> 00:08:02.820
How many times have you actually seen
that same pizza delivery person come to

157
00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:03.450
your house?

158
00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:05.560
Not very often.

159
00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:09.760
So you need to start out with the
intuition why might it be the case that

160
00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:12.980
if I have better employees that it's
going to lead to a better experience and

161
00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:14.660
lead to better financial performance?

162
00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:17.050
Well, it could be the case that if
the person knows my neighborhood,

163
00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:19.100
my food actually arrives on time.

164
00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:21.704
They get the order right on this.

165
00:08:21.704 --> 00:08:25.401
The person taking the order on
the phone is actually more productive,

166
00:08:25.401 --> 00:08:28.800
can get the order taken faster,
they get the right things down.

167
00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:32.560
If I got brand new employees,
they're probably very unproductive.

168
00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:35.740
I have to train them, so I probably
don't want to have to hire new ones.

169
00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:38.200
So all of that should lead
to a better experience.

170
00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:42.230
If I like the pizza delivery person,
I might order more from them.

171
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:45.160
I might tell my friends this is
a great pizza delivery firm.

172
00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:46.960
And ultimately, that's when you're
going to get what you want at the end.

173
00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:51.186
So that's the idea behind
a causal business model.

174
00:08:51.186 --> 00:08:55.440
The ultimate financial results
were growth and financial returns.

175
00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:59.110
But to get there,
how exactly are we going to get there?

176
00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:02.460
Now, if you look at this diagram,
under each one of these round circles,

177
00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:04.910
which is the basic causal model,

178
00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:09.210
there is some more specific things
that we think capture that action.

179
00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:12.200
That's where the performance measures are.

180
00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:15.120
So if you look at under these, you could
come up, for each one of the things

181
00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:19.320
in the rectangles at the bottom, you
could come up with a performance measure.

182
00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:23.350
That is related to the business model,
which is the round circles there, and

183
00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:25.020
we can test that.

184
00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:28.890
If I start gathering measures for
the things in the rectangles,

185
00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:32.110
let's see as the measures
in the blue buckets go up.

186
00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:36.120
What happens to the customer measures,
do I see them going up or not?

187
00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:39.390
Because that's what we're
hypothesizing will happen.

188
00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:42.380
So here's what actually
happened based on this model.

189
00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:44.870
First of all, if you believe this model,

190
00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:46.610
the key thing I care
about is employees first.

191
00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:50.430
If I don't get that right,
my entire strategy is going to fall apart.

192
00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:54.447
So what they did is take employee turnover
as one of their primary metrics for

193
00:09:54.447 --> 00:09:56.975
decision making and
performance evaluation.

194
00:09:56.975 --> 00:10:00.816
And again this is based on intuition,
we just know this must be true.

195
00:10:00.816 --> 00:10:03.780
And again think about employee turnover,
it's costly.

196
00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:06.630
You've got a higher new employees.

197
00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:07.640
I have to do the recruiting.

198
00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:09.860
They're very unproductive
when you first start.

199
00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:11.430
You might have to but them a uniform.

200
00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:15.900
So employee turnover is very,
very expensive.

201
00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:20.670
And it impacts the customer
experience because if I have

202
00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:23.510
an employee who doesn't know
the business or is not trained or

203
00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:26.690
doesn't do it well,
I'm not going to like going there.

204
00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:29.450
So that became a very
important performance measure.

205
00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:33.270
It also entered into the bonus plans for
the store managers.

206
00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:36.059
We're going to evaluate you
on overall employee turnover.

207
00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:40.280
In addition to that we're going to
put in these human resource programs,

208
00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:44.220
retention bonuses to keep people in
place because if what we believe is

209
00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:47.182
employee turnover is one of the key
drivers of financial performance,

210
00:10:47.182 --> 00:10:48.910
we want to figure out
how to keep them there.

211
00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:51.670
Well, what they did is
if you stayed there for

212
00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:55.190
at least a year they starting paying some
of your educational expenses for you.

213
00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:56.800
So now there's an incentive for
you to stay there.

214
00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.270
So we're going to put
the performance measure in.

215
00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:00.090
That's a bonus for people.

216
00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:05.730
We're going to put in this expensive
program to offer retention bonuses

217
00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:09.680
and based on this causal model, and that's
how we're going to run our business.

218
00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:14.582
Well, they did that, spent a lot of
money on these retention bonuses.

219
00:11:14.582 --> 00:11:17.372
Gave bonuses to store manager
based to turnover, and

220
00:11:17.372 --> 00:11:21.660
then they said, well, why don't we go back
and actually see if this model works?

221
00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:26.540
Because we're basing all of this on
a prediction that if these measures,

222
00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:30.130
the rectangular boxes at
the bottom of that diagram,

223
00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:32.920
as they go up and down, we expect that to

224
00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:35.579
translate all the way through to
the end to the financial performance.

225
00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:39.290
Well, they found out some
very interesting things.

226
00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:45.290
First of all, you had stores that
had a very different turn over

227
00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:48.520
that had absolutely no correlation
with financial results.

228
00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:52.760
Well, that was our prediction on some
of this you had some stores that were

229
00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:59.060
extremely profitable with very high
employee turn over and you come to

230
00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:03.520
these and turnover really was not all that
predictive when you started doing this.

231
00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:08.370
Now, here's where you want to be
careful about going from data analysis

232
00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:09.540
right to interpretation.

233
00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:13.260
Now, it turns out I was one of
the consultants working on this.

234
00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:17.055
And their first response, and one you'll
get a lot of times when it doesn't match

235
00:12:17.055 --> 00:12:18.713
intuition, it's got to be wrong.

236
00:12:18.713 --> 00:12:21.639
And what they did was they hired
a statistician to replicate our work and

237
00:12:21.639 --> 00:12:24.800
the statistician came back and
says, well that's exactly right.

238
00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:27.240
That's what the statistics state.

239
00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:30.950
Now, the question is and a key part of
analytics, let's try to understand why.

240
00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:34.240
Well, when they actually went out and

241
00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:39.160
did some qualitative assessments which
I would encourage you to add here,

242
00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:44.790
it turns out that one of the reasons
why stores with higher turnover

243
00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:48.020
might have better financial performance
is they had better managers.

244
00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:51.640
The better managers were in the store more
often, they were actually looking at their

245
00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:54.470
employees, making sure they were
following all the procedures.

246
00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:57.500
They were more willing to fire people
because they knew whether they were doing

247
00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:58.990
a good job or not.

248
00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:00.580
That was part of it.

249
00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:01.160
So it's not necessary.

250
00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:04.230
If you have a good manager, maybe they
will fire people faster because they know,

251
00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:06.240
let's get rid of them or replace them.

252
00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:09.780
The other big issue was,
it depends on what location you're at,

253
00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:12.230
and whether you can
actually replace employees.

254
00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:15.920
It turned out,
in a lot of low income areas,

255
00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.860
you don't have anybody
to replace them with.

256
00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:21.750
So why would I fire them when
it's not necessarily true,

257
00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:25.330
that I could pick up an employee
who's going to be at least as good or

258
00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:27.250
better than the one I currently have.

259
00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:30.000
So part of this is going to
depend on your labor market.

260
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.850
So what actually had to happen then was,
let's do two sets of analysis.

261
00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:41.290
One for stores in low income areas, and
one for stores in high income areas.

262
00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:44.440
So part of predictive analytics is you
need to keep pulling back the onion.

263
00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:46.420
Here's the initial results I get.

264
00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:48.007
Let's try to understand this,

265
00:13:48.007 --> 00:13:50.785
which may lead you to more
analytics work you need to do.

266
00:13:50.785 --> 00:13:55.779
And here it was let's estimate separate
models for different socioeconomic areas

267
00:13:55.779 --> 00:13:59.970
because it has a big impact on what
you think the relationship is.

268
00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:03.100
It has a big impact on what
you would set the bonuses at.

269
00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:07.426
And a big impact on how you
would spend money on this stuff.

270
00:14:07.426 --> 00:14:08.908
What actually happened here,

271
00:14:08.908 --> 00:14:12.000
the management intuition
was partially correct.

272
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.770
because it turned out
after further analysis,

273
00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:19.820
what they found was it's actually not
an overall employee turnover that matters.

274
00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:22.449
It's turnover of
the supervisors of the store.

275
00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:25.730
Those are the people that
do all the scheduling.

276
00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:29.060
They're the ones who are actually making
sure people are following the procedures.

277
00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:31.300
So turnover was right, but

278
00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:36.690
only turnover of a specific type of
employee, which was supervisors.

279
00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:38.770
So this is where you want to make
sure you got the right measure.

280
00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:40.520
Your model was kind of right.

281
00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:43.040
Turnover impacts satisfaction and

282
00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:46.390
impacts other things but
what measure of turnover do you want?

283
00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:48.750
Here, the measure was
turnover of supervisors.

284
00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:53.670
So based on that, and peeling back
the onion, they changed this performance

285
00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:58.800
measure to not overall turnover but
turnover by employee category.

286
00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:00.040
And that's what we're trying to get here.

287
00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:02.500
It's not just performance,
it's not just turnover.

288
00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:07.639
It's which measure of turnover actually
predicts something we care about here.

289
00:15:08.890 --> 00:15:14.680
Further analysis led them to say,
now that I know the relationship

290
00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:19.750
between supervisor turnover and
financials, I can use that to estimate

291
00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:23.370
what the benefit might be from
the size of this retention bonus.

292
00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:24.970
How much am I willing to spend on it?

293
00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:29.390
I don't want to spend too much but
based on this relationship I could say,

294
00:15:29.390 --> 00:15:36.420
if I can increase my supervisor retention,
or lower the turnover by 10% say, how much

295
00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:41.370
am I willing to pay them in a bonus to
actually make that economically feasible?

296
00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:44.030
So it not only changed the performance
measured it changed your

297
00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:47.460
estimate of financial performance.

298
00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:50.930
And finally, after that, again if
you think about that causal model,

299
00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:53.340
it's not just employees to financials.

300
00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:57.240
It's employees to satisfaction
to financial performance.

301
00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:00.320
After that, then they started
estimating this bigger business model.

302
00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:03.110
Where you start looking
at all these linkages.

303
00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:04.950
But it's usually a good
idea to start small.

304
00:16:04.950 --> 00:16:09.822
Let's look at one linkage at a time before
you start trying to estimate all of this.
