00:00:04.792 --> 00:00:07.888
As the last section showed, what we
really need to use the analytics for

2
00:00:07.888 --> 00:00:09.780
is ultimately to choose action plans.

3
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.640
How can I take this analysis to say,

4
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:16.082
how can I as a manager actually implement
something that's gonna improve some non

5
00:00:16.082 --> 00:00:19.490
financial dimension that ultimately
leads to higher financial performance?

6
00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.529
Again, how can I pick out the thing that's
got that biggest bang for the buck.

7
00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.930
And again there's lot's
of ways we can do this.

8
00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.380
So ultimately you should
really think about this as

9
00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.490
again peeling back the onion.

10
00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.500
You find these initial statistic results,
but what you need to do is then say

11
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.810
okay if I find that, what exactly
is driving that relationship, and

12
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:44.020
what can we as a company do
to actually improve this?

13
00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.630
So even though you may start out thinking,
hey what I'm looking at is

14
00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.870
the relationship between a customer
measure and financial performance,

15
00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.610
in the end what actually may be driving
that has nothing to do with that.

16
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.610
It may have something to do
with your employees on this,

17
00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.120
it may have something to
do with your facilities.

18
00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.870
So looking at these non financial
metrics in isolation of other metrics,

19
00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.720
is not especially sophisticated.

20
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.399
You really need to put all these metrics

21
00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.020
in the broader business model
that your company's working with.

22
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.380
Try not to do it just functionally,
because what you find a lot is marketing

23
00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.860
does some analyses, operations does some
analyses, quality does some analyses.

24
00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.820
Nobody's talking to each other.

25
00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.030
And it's not like the actions in one
function doesn't impact the other one.

26
00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.350
So if you really wanna say, how are these
metrics related to each other, and

27
00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.280
how are the actions gonna
impact financial results?

28
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.430
You need to start thinking a little
broader, and then peeling it back and

29
00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.190
saying even if I'm looking at this
function, maybe it's the function over

30
00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.830
here where I really have to take
the action plan on this, right.

31
00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.840
So you may think of starting out saying
I'm looking at customer satisfaction

32
00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.490
financial performance.

33
00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.610
But ultimately as we saw in some of the
earlier examples it may be the case that

34
00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.380
things like employees are related to other
financial or non financials, customers.

35
00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.610
It may be that these non financial numbers
ultimately lead to the financials, but

36
00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.060
there's intermediate financial numbers
you need to think about, right.

37
00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:06.690
It could be they lead to cost reductions,
it could actually be

38
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.620
they lead to cost increases because I have
to spend money to make these things go up.

39
00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:13.310
And then ultimately it's
that cost increase, or

40
00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.260
investment in something like R and D,
that leads to the financial results.

41
00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.720
So you again need this causal model,
I predict that if A happens, B happens.

42
00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.590
If B happens, C happens.

43
00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.883
And lay that out, and they could be
either be financial or non financial.

44
00:02:27.883 --> 00:02:31.952
So let's walk through an example of how
you would keep peeling back the onion

45
00:02:31.952 --> 00:02:36.150
until you get to this action plan that
one, you could do the financial analysis

46
00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.238
on and two, decide this is something
that I think a manager can actually do.

47
00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.510
So let's go back to a financial
services firm that we looked at before.

48
00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.165
So this was the firm that when they did
the initial analysis trying to link

49
00:02:50.165 --> 00:02:55.920
customer satisfaction at the firm level
to firm financials, they found nothing.

50
00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.870
What they did find,
was there was a big relationship

51
00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.944
between how satisfied are you
with your investment adviser.

52
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.150
Which had a relationship with how much
asset did you have invested with them.

53
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.770
And this was an example of,
on this one to seven scale,

54
00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:13.990
you wanted people to be really satisfied
with their investment adviser.

55
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:16.700
That's where the biggest bang for
the buck is.

56
00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:17.770
That sounds great.

57
00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:22.070
What does it mean to say I'm
satisfied with my investment adviser.

58
00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:26.350
What can this company do to actually
make you more satisfied as a customer?

59
00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.740
Because if I stopped here,
if I was a manager and my boss told me,

60
00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:34.970
increase satisfaction with your investment
adviser, I have no idea what to do.

61
00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.110
I have no idea when the customer
answered that what they meant by saying,

62
00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:40.390
I'm satisfied.

63
00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.789
So what we're gonna have to do is,
now let's step back.

64
00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:47.489
What do we mean by satisfied
with the investment adviser, and

65
00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.632
what can we actually do to
implement an action plan?

66
00:03:52.021 --> 00:03:54.338
Okay so
here is what this company wanted to do.

67
00:03:54.338 --> 00:03:57.120
We had that initial result,
what they wanted to understand,

68
00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.650
what are the drivers that I can actually

69
00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.460
take an action on that's going to lead
to these future financial performance.

70
00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.640
Because again, we want to use that
to develop our strategy, and two,

71
00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.070
we need to select these action plans with
the largest expected economic payoff.

72
00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.610
As we saw before, increases in customer
retention and assets invested, or

73
00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:20.249
under management, had a direct
impact on future economic success.

74
00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.860
But again, this company didn't know
what the drivers of retention and

75
00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.240
assets invested were.

76
00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.430
And without knowing that,
I don't know where to invest money,

77
00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.350
I don't know how to change my strategy to
take advantage of this information, and

78
00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.130
I don't know how to tell my
managers which dimensions

79
00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.410
of satisfaction do we
think we need to focus on.

80
00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:45.130
Okay, well it turns out, once you start
peeling this back, additional analysis

81
00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.640
found out this customer satisfaction with
the investment adviser was related to

82
00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:54.100
three things, trustworthiness,
responsiveness, and knowledge.

83
00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:01.540
Okay, the big thing though was not those,
it was investor adviser turnover.

84
00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.390
Not just, what do I think of the
investment advisor I have now, is, really,

85
00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:10.440
can I deal with the same person over and
over again.

86
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.580
Think about it, I'm taking my pension
fund, I'm taking all my savings.

87
00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.750
I want to give all this
to an investment adviser,

88
00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.340
I want to deal with that same person.

89
00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.840
I want them to feel like
part of the family here.

90
00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.321
So the big issue here was not just
satisfaction, now I peeled it back,

91
00:05:24.321 --> 00:05:27.508
and now I have to start looking
at investment adviser turnover.

92
00:05:27.508 --> 00:05:30.491
What can you do to reduce turnover?

93
00:05:30.491 --> 00:05:34.654
That's one step back when you do
the analytics, from what we had before.

94
00:05:34.654 --> 00:05:36.762
Okay, well we still have to go further,

95
00:05:36.762 --> 00:05:39.499
because I still don't know
how to reduce turnover.

96
00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.820
So again you can start
doing analytics on this.

97
00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:45.570
So here's the model they estimated.

98
00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:48.000
Now again if you look
on the right hand side,

99
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.690
there are the ultimate outcomes I wanted.

100
00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:54.800
We started out with customer satisfaction
with the investment adviser.

101
00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.540
When it goes up it impacts
whether I stick with you, and

102
00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:00.200
how much money I invest with you.

103
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.860
Okay that's fine.

104
00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.440
We took that a step back and
we said, okay,

105
00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:08.040
what's the big driver of customer
satisfaction that matters?

106
00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.330
Investor advisement turnover.

107
00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.510
Let's take one step back from there.

108
00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:15.710
What are the things we can do as a company

109
00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:20.120
that are going to impact
investment adviser turnover?

110
00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.060
So what you see here,
the little pluses is it's a positive and

111
00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.450
significant relationship, okay.

112
00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:27.250
Because a company didn't want
us to give the coefficients.

113
00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:32.810
If it's got more little plus signs, it's
more significant than if it's got fewer.

114
00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:36.020
So if you look here, there's certain
things that have a stronger statistical

115
00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:37.235
relationship than other ones.

116
00:06:37.235 --> 00:06:39.310
So what you would like to do again is say,

117
00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:43.520
given the ones that have a big
impact on adviser turnover.

118
00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:47.370
And given how much money it's gonna cost
you to actually do that, where would we

119
00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:51.820
like, as a company, to change our
strategy and change our action plans.

120
00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:55.019
Okay, so here's what they
ended up doing based on that.

121
00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.750
You find out that the level of
compensation is one of the most

122
00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:00.260
important drivers adviser term.

123
00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:04.070
Not really surprising, right,
if I pay them enough we're gonna get that.

124
00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:07.670
The question is how much are you
will to pay them, right?

125
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:11.420
But based on this, they started looking
at what are some of the other things

126
00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:13.689
in addition to pay to
develop these action plans.

127
00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:15.650
And based on that,

128
00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:18.800
what they found out is some of these
things are things like work environment.

129
00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:23.130
Is the work environment better in terms
of work environment as perceived by

130
00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:24.500
the investment adviser.

131
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:27.280
Knowing that, now you can start
coming up with one of these net

132
00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:30.130
present value models that we had before.

133
00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:33.810
We started out with customer satisfaction
leading to financial performance.

134
00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:35.660
We ended up having nothing
to do with customers.

135
00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:37.690
We came up with a human
resource initiative and

136
00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:39.530
linked that up to economic value.

137
00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:42.140
So here's where if you're gonna start
doing the action plans you gotta keep

138
00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:45.439
peeling it back and it may turn out you
end up in a place you never started.

139
00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:48.570
Because when we started working on this,

140
00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:50.370
we started working with
the marketing department.

141
00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:54.280
We ended up working with the HR department
because that's where the actual driver

142
00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:57.070
was, that was gonna lead to
this financial performance.

143
00:07:57.070 --> 00:08:00.670
And that's where you have to put in
this causal model of what drives it,

144
00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:04.150
and keep working backwards as you
go through the model on this.
