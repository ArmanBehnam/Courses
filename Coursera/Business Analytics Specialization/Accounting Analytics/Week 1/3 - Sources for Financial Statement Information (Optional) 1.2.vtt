00:00:03.752 --> 00:00:05.320
Hello, I'm Professor Brian Bushee.

2
00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:06.253
Welcome back.

3
00:00:06.253 --> 00:00:10.988
In this video, we're gonna do a quick look
at different sources where you can get

4
00:00:10.988 --> 00:00:14.135
financial statement
information about companies.

5
00:00:14.135 --> 00:00:16.817
This video is optional so if you
already know a lot of these sources,

6
00:00:16.817 --> 00:00:18.580
you don't need to watch the video.

7
00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.142
But if you're new to this and you want
some advice on places that you can get

8
00:00:22.142 --> 00:00:25.824
the kind of financial statement
information on companies that we'll use in

9
00:00:25.824 --> 00:00:28.580
this course then this is the video for
you.

10
00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:29.260
Let's get started.

11
00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.170
The first source to go to find
a Company's financial statement data

12
00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:36.750
is it's on website.

13
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.140
On the website, there's usually
an investor relations page that will have

14
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.130
all the company's financial statements.

15
00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:43.134
Let me show you.

16
00:00:44.662 --> 00:00:48.053
Let's go to the 3M Company's website.

17
00:00:48.053 --> 00:00:50.040
To find the financial information,

18
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.803
you generally have to go
to the bottom of a website.

19
00:00:52.803 --> 00:00:56.138
Cuz for some reason companies are much
more interested in trying to convince

20
00:00:56.138 --> 00:00:57.336
you to buy their products,

21
00:00:57.336 --> 00:01:01.270
than they are in having you take
a look at their financial statements.

22
00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.280
So way down here at the bottom,
under About Us,

23
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.370
we have Investor Relations,
then there is a link for Financials,

24
00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.330
where you can get Quarterly Earnings,
Annual Reports, SEC Filings.

25
00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:11.440
Let's look at Annual Reports.

26
00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.470
And here is the 24 Annual Report.

27
00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.490
We can click on that and
then if you go in far enough,

28
00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.800
you'll eventually find
the financial statements.

29
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.830
Another good place to look
is the SEC Edgar website.

30
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.310
The SEC is the US Securities and
Exchange Commission.

31
00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.840
In here's where they have all the
financial filings for US companies and for

32
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.810
any non-US companies that
are listed in US markets.

33
00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.030
So lemme show what this looks like.

34
00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.500
If you Google SEC Edgar,
you'll come up with this webpage.

35
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.435
You can type in a company name so
we'll do 3m, Search.

36
00:01:50.435 --> 00:01:52.520
Here's 3M company.

37
00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.850
Click on that, then you can see all of
their filings, the AKs current reports,

38
00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.460
quarterly reports.

39
00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.320
If you want to find the an report or
10K you can just put that in and search.

40
00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.740
Then you can click, click,
click on financial statements and,

41
00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.839
voila, you get to the 3M company
financial statements on the SEC website.

42
00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.690
>> Professor,
I only follow companies in Hong Kong.

43
00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.930
That SEC Edgar website is useless to me.

44
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.390
What do you propose I do?

45
00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.120
>> Well, I would suggest that you search
for the information on the internet.

46
00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.910
So I Googled Hong Kong
company finance statements.

47
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.650
I found this website called HKExnews,

48
00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.732
where I was able to type in the name of
a company on the exchange, so Phoenix TV.

49
00:02:39.732 --> 00:02:43.690
Then I went down and hit Search, and

50
00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.740
it brought up a list of all of
Phoenix TV's filings and press releases.

51
00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.010
So I was able to click on interim report,
brought up the interim report.

52
00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.110
I was able to page down,
scroll down through all of the pages and

53
00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.233
eventually get to their
financial statements.

54
00:02:59.233 --> 00:03:02.400
Now it would take me a lot of time to do
this for all the countries in the world,

55
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.850
cuz last time I looked,
there's a couple hundred of them.

56
00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.450
So maybe what I'll suggest is that you
guys create a discussion forum thread.

57
00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.060
Where if you find good sources of
financial statements for your country,

58
00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.930
you can post it to that thread and
share it with the other students.

59
00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:23.874
Another source you could use is one of the
Internet finance sites like Morningstar,

60
00:03:23.874 --> 00:03:28.543
or Google Finance, or Yahoo Finance,
or Reuters, to give four examples.

61
00:03:31.002 --> 00:03:34.270
>> Dude,
do I like have to subscribe to these?

62
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:35.720
And like which one should I use?

63
00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.060
>> You can get most of the information
you need on these sites for free.

64
00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.010
But as you navigate through them,
you may see links to

65
00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.070
other useful information that you do
have to subscribe to get access to.

66
00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.260
And so if you're gonna do a lot of this,
maybe you do want to subscribe.

67
00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.660
Now I'm not gonna recommend
which site to use,

68
00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.400
mainly because none of these people
are paying me to recommend them.

69
00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.750
So if somebody out there wants
to sponsor this video and

70
00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.450
pay me to recommend their site,
maybe I will.

71
00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.840
But until then,
I'll just give you a list and

72
00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.739
you can decide which ones you want to use.

73
00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:12.340
So let's just take a look at
Morningstar as an example.

74
00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.083
So you can type in the ticker
symbol if you know it.

75
00:04:15.083 --> 00:04:17.359
So for 3M it's MMM.

76
00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:20.244
So 3M Company.

77
00:04:20.244 --> 00:04:23.180
Then I can click on Financials.

78
00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:29.850
And it gives me income statement balance
sheet cash flow, I can choose Annual or

79
00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:31.910
Quarterly, amount of periods.

80
00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.650
And so this is a quick way that I can
get financial statement information on

81
00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.080
a large number of companies.

82
00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:43.950
And the last source is you could subscribe
to the Wharton Research Data Services or

83
00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:45.839
WRDS, let me show you
what that looks like.

84
00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.670
If you search under WRDS,

85
00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:55.300
you'll hopefully come to our website for
Wharton Research Data Services.

86
00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.080
The benefit of this data is you can

87
00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:03.130
quickly retrieve financial statement items
on thousands and thousands of companies.

88
00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:06.750
The drawback is my understanding,
it's incredibly expensive.

89
00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:11.340
So, you probably only want to do this if
your institution already has an account.

90
00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:12.920
And you could look to see whether,

91
00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.330
if you're with the Board of Governors,
US Patent and Trademark, or

92
00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.860
various universities or companies,
you might already have an account.

93
00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.790
If not and this would be useful to you,

94
00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:24.310
you could talk to your company
about buying an account.

95
00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.430
But, this is something that's really
good if you work for an institution and

96
00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.140
you need to do heavy-duty data analysis.

97
00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:33.350
But if you're just an individual
that's gonna dabble in this stuff,

98
00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:36.130
you probably want to use one of
the sources that we looked at earlier.

99
00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.490
>> Okay, got it!

100
00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:44.075
When are we going to do
something interesting?

101
00:05:44.075 --> 00:05:46.815
>> Okay, okay enough with
the optional preliminaries.

102
00:05:46.815 --> 00:05:49.176
In the next video, we'll start
doing the more interesting stuff.

103
00:05:49.176 --> 00:05:52.528
But you gotta give me some credit, at
least I brought this in under 15 minutes.

104
00:05:52.528 --> 00:05:56.085
It's really hard for me to make
a video that's less than 15 minutes.

105
00:05:57.785 --> 00:06:01.299
That wraps up our look at the different
sources that you can get financial

106
00:06:01.299 --> 00:06:02.380
statement information.

107
00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:03.751
In the next video,

108
00:06:03.751 --> 00:06:09.253
we will start our analysis of a company
using ratio-analysis techniques.

109
00:06:09.253 --> 00:06:11.711
I'll see you then.

110
00:06:11.711 --> 00:06:13.336
>> See you next video!
