00:00:03.886 --> 00:00:05.310
Hello, I'm Professor Brian Bushee.

2
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:06.440
Welcome back.

3
00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.850
In this video, we're gonna take
a look at liquidity ratios.

4
00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:13.170
Liquidity ratios tell us about
a company's cash position.

5
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.183
So, in the short term, is there enough
cash that's gonna come in to cover

6
00:00:17.183 --> 00:00:19.448
the cash the company needs to pay out, and

7
00:00:19.448 --> 00:00:22.964
in the longer term what's
the company's borrowing capacity?

8
00:00:22.964 --> 00:00:28.223
Will they be able to borrow money if they
needed to meet future cash crunches?

9
00:00:28.223 --> 00:00:31.529
Those are the kind of things we're
gonna look at with liquidity ratios so,

10
00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:32.480
let's get started.

11
00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.000
Let me give you a quick overview of the
different kinds of liquidity ratios we're

12
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.410
gonna look at.

13
00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.240
So, we'll look at some short-term
liquidity ratios which are telling us

14
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.020
about the company's
short-term cash position.

15
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.080
We'll do a few ratios that use assets and
liabilities to give us that information.

16
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.530
And some ratios that use
interest expense and

17
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.370
cash flow numbers to
give us that information.

18
00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.650
Then we'll look at longer
term liquidity ratios.

19
00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.940
These are trying to tell us about
the companies borrowing capacity,

20
00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.020
risk of bankruptcy,
how it's financing it's growth, and

21
00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:07.490
here we'll get in to debt to equity and
other leverage ratios.

22
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.685
So let's start with the first bucket
of short term liquidity ratios.

23
00:01:11.685 --> 00:01:15.720
These ratios are intended to answer
the question, does the company have enough

24
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.610
cash coming in to cover its obligations
to pay out cash in the next period?

25
00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.190
And ideally all these
ratios would be over one.

26
00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.051
So the first ratio is the current ratio,

27
00:01:26.051 --> 00:01:28.469
which is current assets
over current liabilities.

28
00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:29.637
This is trying to say,

29
00:01:29.637 --> 00:01:33.696
do we have enough current assets that are
going to turn into cash in the next year

30
00:01:33.696 --> 00:01:37.780
to cover our current liabilities which
have to be paid in cash in the next year.

31
00:01:40.787 --> 00:01:43.010
>> This is utterly nonsensical.

32
00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.910
Some current assets are non-cash prepaids

33
00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:49.490
whilst some liabilities
are non-cash unearned revenue.

34
00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.210
Including non-cash in
these is nonsensical.

35
00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.270
>> Yeah, keep in mind that these
ratios are approximations.

36
00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.300
We don't have enough data in the financial
statements to know exactly how much

37
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.690
assets are gonna turn to cash and

38
00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.790
exactly how much liabilities have to
be paid in cash in the next period.

39
00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.530
These are just quick and
dirty approximations.

40
00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.000
But I do have a quick and

41
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.639
dirty refinement to the current
ratio which I'll show you next.

42
00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.240
So our refinement to the current
ration is the quick ratio.

43
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.170
Here in the numerator were just
going to take cash plus receivables,

44
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.970
focusing on the most liquid assets.

45
00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.960
The assets that will convert
to cash most quickly and

46
00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.150
divide those by current liabilities.

47
00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.280
So,we still include some non-cash
liabilities, potential, and

48
00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.330
current liabilities but
at least we're getting a better measure of

49
00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.160
assets that will turn
the cash in the next period.

50
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.960
And then the final ratio in this bucket

51
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.100
is cash flow from operations
to current liabilities.

52
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.648
So this is cash from operations divided
by average current liabilities.

53
00:02:49.648 --> 00:02:53.565
What it's trying to tell us is did
the business generate enough cash during

54
00:02:53.565 --> 00:02:57.560
the year to cover its average level of
current liabilities during the year.

55
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.700
The next bucket of ratios
are interest coverage ratios.

56
00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.803
These are trying to answer the question,
does the company have enough cash coming

57
00:03:06.803 --> 00:03:09.786
in from its operations to cover
its interest obligations?

58
00:03:09.786 --> 00:03:12.524
Again, ideally these
ratios would be over 1.

59
00:03:12.524 --> 00:03:15.570
So we're gonna do a measure
using income statement numbers.

60
00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.950
So we're gonna take operating
income before depreciation,

61
00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:24.080
which is an approximation of
the cash component of income

62
00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.100
cuz we take out depreciation
as a non-cash expense and

63
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.730
then we divide that by interest
expense on the income statement.

64
00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.760
I think a more direct measure
of the cash position is what's

65
00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.820
called cash interest coverage.

66
00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.320
So we take the cash flow from operations,
we add back cash interest paid and

67
00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.330
cash taxes paid,
these are required disclosures,

68
00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.130
you can always find them somewhere
in the financial statements.

69
00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:53.100
So this numerator gives us a preinterest
pretax cash flow from the business, and

70
00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.580
we see whether that's big enough to cover
the cash interest paid during the year.

71
00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.590
>> These ratios are backwards-looking.

72
00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.430
I don't care about last year.

73
00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:04.910
I care about next year.

74
00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:07.340
>> I also care about the future.

75
00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.790
Unfortunately, I haven't figured out
a good way to know exactly what's gonna

76
00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.020
happen in the future yet.

77
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.660
Lacking that, the best we can do is
look at historical experience to see if

78
00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.290
the company has been able to cover
their interest payments in the past.

79
00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.070
If so, and
if nothing dramatically is changing for

80
00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.920
the company, then it's a pretty good
indication that the company will probably

81
00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.170
be able to cover its interest
payments in the future.

82
00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.670
Let's take a look at these ratios for
Woof Junction.

83
00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:37.190
So we start with the current ratio.

84
00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.402
It is well above one.

85
00:04:39.402 --> 00:04:44.779
It's been pretty steady except for
a little downward blip in 2014.

86
00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:47.116
The Quick Ratio is not above one, but

87
00:04:47.116 --> 00:04:50.630
that's pretty common
that it's less than one.

88
00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:53.820
It would be an extreme situation where
a company had enough in cash and

89
00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.359
receivables to cover all
of its current liabilities.

90
00:04:56.359 --> 00:05:00.263
The good news here is it
trended upward in 2015 and

91
00:05:00.263 --> 00:05:05.646
then cashflow from operations to
current liabilities again above one and

92
00:05:05.646 --> 00:05:08.966
pretty steady other than a blip in 2013.

93
00:05:08.966 --> 00:05:11.439
If we look at the interest coverage and

94
00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:16.388
the cash interest coverage, huge
positive ratios suggesting that Woof has

95
00:05:16.388 --> 00:05:21.690
more than enough cash coming in to
cover its interest obligations.

96
00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:24.400
But part of our problem is it's
hard to look at these in isolation,

97
00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.930
we need to bring in our competitors, so
let me un-hide some columns here and

98
00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:33.400
bring up Ooh La Lab and
the Specialty Pet Retail group.

99
00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:38.578
And what we can see is, the Current and
Quick Ratios are inline with what

100
00:05:38.578 --> 00:05:43.599
you see for Ooh La Lab and higher
than the industry average as a whole.

101
00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:46.501
Same thing with
the CFO-to-Current Liabilities ratio.

102
00:05:46.501 --> 00:05:51.283
So, Woof Junction looks like it's
in really good shape in these

103
00:05:51.283 --> 00:05:53.910
ratios in its industry.

104
00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:56.340
And then when you look at interest
coverage and cash interest coverage,

105
00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:01.060
it's way in excess of what you see for
Ooh La Lab and the industry as a whole,

106
00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:04.550
indicating that Woof is doing both
a good job generating cash from

107
00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:08.260
running the business, and controlling
the amount of their interest expense.

108
00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:15.759
Finally, we're gonna take a look at
the longer term liquidity ratios.

109
00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:19.938
These ratios are going to try to answer
the questions of how does the company

110
00:06:19.938 --> 00:06:20.879
finances grow?

111
00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:23.883
Does it tend to use a lot
of debt financing, or

112
00:06:23.883 --> 00:06:27.710
does it tend to raise
equity from investors?

113
00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:30.130
They also provide measures
of bankruptcy risk.

114
00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:34.890
So the more debt you have relative to
equity, the higher the risk is you

115
00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:37.760
default on that debt and the debt
holders force you into bankruptcy,

116
00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:40.400
which would cause the equity
holders to lose their investment.

117
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.410
They also measure borrowing capacity, the
more debt that you have relative to your

118
00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:49.170
equity, the less likely banks or other
financiers are gonna lend you more money.

119
00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:52.590
So the first ratio is just
a debt to equity ratio,

120
00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:55.660
which is total liabilities over
total stockholders' equity.

121
00:06:55.660 --> 00:07:00.380
So the ratio of your borrowing from
external parties versus raising money from

122
00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:01.720
your owners.

123
00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:05.600
Sometimes total assets is used in the
denominator instead of total stockholder's

124
00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.710
equity and
it would be a debt to assets ratio.

125
00:07:09.295 --> 00:07:13.420
Long-term-debt to equity focuses
just on the long term debt portion

126
00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:17.240
cuz total liability includes things like
warranties payable or taxes payable,

127
00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:19.310
very short term liabilities.

128
00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:22.050
So this is a more longer term ratio.

129
00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:25.320
So, ratio of long-term debt
to stockholders' equity.

130
00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.980
And then finally Long-Term Debt
to Tangible Assets, so

131
00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:31.460
we take Total Long-Term Debt
in the numerator divided by

132
00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:34.460
Total Assets minus Intangible Assets.

133
00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:37.370
So, what we're doing in
the denominator is we're taking out

134
00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:39.470
intangibles like contractual rights or

135
00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:43.680
good will and leaving it with tangible or
physical assets.

136
00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:48.130
Physical assets like inventory and trucks
and buildings would be things that you'd

137
00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:51.110
be more likely to be able to
sell if you had to liquidate.

138
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:55.406
So, it's basically a ratio of your
long-term debt to assets that you could

139
00:07:55.406 --> 00:07:56.489
sell if you had to.

140
00:07:59.147 --> 00:08:04.020
>> Honey, where I come from,
we call these leverage ratios.

141
00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:09.260
But, in the DuPont analysis,
you had a different leverage ratio.

142
00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.680
Y'all need to explain the difference.

143
00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:14.300
>> Yes, I am confused as well.

144
00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:17.190
In London, we call these gearing ratios.

145
00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:21.220
>> Yeah, and
in Canada they call them leverage ratios.

146
00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:23.600
So leverage, leverage, gearing,

147
00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:28.540
this is one of the most overused generic
terms for ratios that out there.

148
00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:30.800
People talk about the leverage
ratios all the time.

149
00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:34.790
The fact of the matter is, how we wanna
measure leverage for the DuPont formula

150
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:39.160
is different than how we wanna measure
leverage for this liquidity ratios.

151
00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:42.440
We're looking for
different information in both situations.

152
00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:45.060
So, before you ask for a leverage ratio

153
00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:49.420
make sure you know what leverage ratio
you want and how it should be defined.

154
00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:52.280
In effect don't ask for
a leverage ratio, be more specific.

155
00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:56.475
Do you want financial leverage, debt
to equity, long-term-debt to equity or

156
00:08:56.475 --> 00:08:57.100
whatever.

157
00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:02.140
Let's take a look at these ratios for
Woof Junction.

158
00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:07.280
So, we have debt to equity which is below
one, which means that Woof is using more

159
00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:12.530
equity financing than debt financing, and
it's been trending downward over time.

160
00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:15.180
If we just focus on
long-term-debt to equity,

161
00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:19.230
and long-term-debt to tangible assets,
it's a fairly low number, but

162
00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:22.200
it has trended up a little
bit in the last year.

163
00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:26.900
But these are ratios where you really
need to look at the comparison firms.

164
00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:31.490
Cuz it's very industry
specific about how much

165
00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:35.330
debt companies need to take
on to finance their growth.

166
00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:38.910
So if we look at Ooh La Lab and
the industry group,

167
00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:43.960
we see that Woof Junction is much
lower in all three of these ratios.

168
00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:49.300
Which means that Woof is using much less
debt financing than the competitors,

169
00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:53.650
has much lower bankruptcy risk, and much
more borrowing capacity going forward.

170
00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:55.140
All really good news.

171
00:09:56.920 --> 00:10:00.990
That concludes our ratio
analysis of Woof Junction.

172
00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:04.520
We've seen that they're in
great shape in their liquidity,

173
00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:07.980
they're looking good in profitability and
efficiency as well.

174
00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:10.250
Things are really going
great at Woof Junction.

175
00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:14.420
But what does the future hold for
Woof Junction?

176
00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:17.910
Well, that's what we're going to
start to look at in the next video.

177
00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:21.160
I'll see you then.

178
00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:22.326
