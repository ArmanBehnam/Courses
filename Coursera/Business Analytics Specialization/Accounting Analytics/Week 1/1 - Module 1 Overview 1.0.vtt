Hello, I'm professor Brian Bushee and

2
00:00:09.106 --> 00:00:13.792
welcome to the first week of my part
of the accounting analytics course.

3
00:00:13.792 --> 00:00:16.690
I wanna give you a quick overview of

4
00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:20.180
all the topics that we're gonna cover this
week so that you know what to expect.

5
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.230
The overarching topic for the week
is ratio analysis and forecasting.

6
00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.200
But since ratio analysis involves
financial statement numbers,

7
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.900
what I decided to do was put together
a couple optional videos, in case you need

8
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:39.290
a little bit of extra practice or review
on what's in the financial statements.

9
00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.020
And where to find
financial statement data.

10
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.660
So those videos are there if you
need them, but they're optional.

11
00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.610
Then, we'll move into the ratio analysis.

12
00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.870
We'll do a ratio analysis
of a single company.

13
00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.480
So first I'll do a video which
explains the company's strategy and

14
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.530
business model, then we'll do
a video on the DuPont analysis.

15
00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.770
A video that analyzes profitability and
turnover ratios and

16
00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.360
a video that analyzes the liquidity
ratios for the company.

17
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.090
Once we've put together all the ratios,
the next step will be forecasting so that

18
00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.450
we can use all those historical ratios
to forecast future financial statements.

19
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.340
The last video of the week is also
optional and it's on valuation.

20
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.770
Once you have forecasted
financial statements,

21
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.600
there's not much more you need to
do to come up with a valuation.

22
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.870
In other words, a guess on what
the company's stock price should be.

23
00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.250
Now there are whole courses
out there on valuation,

24
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.560
which I highly recommend that you take.

25
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.600
This is just sort of a little bit
of knowledge about valuation.

26
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.150
But I'll put it out there and I'll make it
optional so you don't have to watch it and

27
00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.750
it certainly won't be
part of the final exam.

28
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.660
That's a pretty ambitious agenda for the
week and I've certainly have a lot to say

29
00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.030
on the topic, so there's gonna
be a lot of minutes of video.

30
00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.376
So let's wrap up this intro and
get to work on the material.
