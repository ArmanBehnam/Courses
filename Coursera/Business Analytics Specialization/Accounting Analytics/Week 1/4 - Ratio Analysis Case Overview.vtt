00:00:03.372 --> 00:00:05.970
Hello, I'm Professor Brian Bushee
welcome back.

2
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.770
In this video we're gonna do an overview
of the company Woof Junction

3
00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:12.280
that we're going to analyze this week.

4
00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.870
I know it's tempting to just jump in and

5
00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:18.200
start looking at ratios but we wouldn't
actually learn anything if we did that.

6
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.060
We first need to know
the company's strategy and

7
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.980
business model to be able
to interpret the ratios.

8
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.680
What the ratios can tell us is what part
of the company's strategy is working,

9
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.070
or not working.

10
00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.310
So let's take a few minutes to
learn about Woof Junction and

11
00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.440
then we can get into the ratio
analysis in another video.

12
00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:38.130
Let's get started!

13
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.610
The company that we’re going to be
analyzing in the next few videos is called

14
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.080
Woof Junction.

15
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.220
It’s a specialty retailer of fashionable
clothes and accessories for dogs.

16
00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.560
They’re located in a lot
of shopping malls and

17
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.740
on hip shopping streets in the US,Canada,
and United Kingdom.

18
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.700
They have over 1200 stores at this point.

19
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.846
They own most of their own stores,
they don't tend to use franchisees.

20
00:01:08.722 --> 00:01:11.810
>> It appears that the dog
is happy about this case.

21
00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.790
But does this company really exist?

22
00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.320
>> No, sadly,
Woof Junction is not a real company.

23
00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.080
So don't run out to the shopping
mall after this video

24
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.990
to check out their products.

25
00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.840
What I'm gonna do in these videos is
anytime I wanna talk about a real company,

26
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.040
I'm gonna disguise it.

27
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.270
I'm gonna change the name, change some of
the facts, so you can't tell who it is.

28
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.300
I'm gonna do that for three reasons.

29
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.060
First, I don't have to worry about a real
company getting into a scandal right after

30
00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.439
I shoot the video, and
then the video looking inappropriate.

31
00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.890
Second, if it was a real company you could
find out what actually happened after

32
00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.610
the point of the analysis which would sort
of spoil some of the surprise aspects

33
00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.720
of going through the analysis.

34
00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.530
And third, if it was a real company
it'd have to worry about what I said.

35
00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.130
Cuz the last thing I want to do is get
a call from a real companies lawyers,

36
00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.040
because I've said bad things about it on
a video that's going around the world.

37
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.080
So for all those reasons, I'm going to
disguise real companies when I use them in

38
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.400
videos, but I think this is sort of
a cool idea so if you're looking for

39
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.190
a business idea,
Woof Junction may be the way to go.

40
00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.900
Their strategy is to try to develop a
strong reputation as a fashion trendsetter

41
00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.790
with good quality clothes
at reasonable prices.

42
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.410
They have a team of designers that work
two years in advance to try to create

43
00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.060
the next stylish but basic "look" for
them to rollout into their stores.

44
00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.370
They carry a very deep inventory
of a limited number of items.

45
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.110
They try to bring in a new collection
of styles every two months, any

46
00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:44.010
older styles that are still around, they
try to sell quickly by slashing prices.

47
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.490
Their clothing is manufactured
under the Woof Junction label, so

48
00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.580
you won't find any other brand
name clothes in their stores.

49
00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.240
They use 450 supplies, 38% in the U.S,
the rest they're in China, and

50
00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.220
other countries, and they tried to
impose strict quality standards and

51
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.330
inspections to make sure
the quality is uniform and good.

52
00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.710
Most of their inventory is maintained
at regional distribution centers or

53
00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:12.210
warehouses, not in the store.

54
00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.930
But then they have point of sale
scanners that will automatically

55
00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.760
reorder inventory to restock their
retail stores as quickly as possible.

56
00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.910
They try to establish a very strong brand
name through extensive advertising and

57
00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.620
promotional campaigns.

58
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.740
Through celebrity endorsements and this is
both celebrity people and celebrity dogs.

59
00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:36.590
Their stores always have the same look but
they frequently rearrange the displays,

60
00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.890
so it has a fresh look every
time that you come in.

61
00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.110
Their management team
has been very stable.

62
00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:46.530
Most of the management team is still
around from the founding of the company.

63
00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.430
They had very high growth in sales and

64
00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.730
earnings despite struggles
in the industry.

65
00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.550
Woof Junction has been labeled
as the nation's hottest retailer

66
00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:56.660
by a major business magazine.

67
00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.720
Most of their growth has come
from new store openings.

68
00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.230
And right now, their stock price is $55
a share with price-earnings ratio of 32.

69
00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:09.700
>> What is this thing called
a price-earnings ratio?

70
00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.280
And is 32 good or bad?

71
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.633
>> The price-earnings ratio, or

72
00:04:14.633 --> 00:04:19.310
P/E ratio is the ratio of the company
stock price to its earnings per share.

73
00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.360
People will use this as a quick and dirty
way to try to figure out what the value of

74
00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.240
a company's stock price should be.

75
00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:31.060
So what they'll do is look at the average
P/E ratio within the company's industry,

76
00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.040
or they'll look at the company's
historical P/E ratio.

77
00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.470
So once you have a benchmark P/E ratio,
if you multiply that times earnings,

78
00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.860
it gives you what
the stock price should be.

79
00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.370
Then you can it to actual stock price and
get a sense for

80
00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.012
whether the company is over or
under valued.

81
00:04:45.012 --> 00:04:49.400
So P/E ratio of 32 would only
make sense if you compared it to

82
00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.760
other firms in the industry or
to Woof Junction's historical ratio.

83
00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.130
I'm not gonna talk about it anymore than
this because I think it's a really bad way

84
00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.240
to assess the value of the company.

85
00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.840
If you are interested in valuation,

86
00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.160
I will do an optional video later
on where I will show you a much

87
00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.836
better way that you can try to come up
with the value of a company stock price.

88
00:05:09.836 --> 00:05:14.802
Because they have been ,so successful
they're facing heavy threats from

89
00:05:14.802 --> 00:05:16.840
their competition.

90
00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:21.300
Major department store retailers and
other specialty clothing store chains have

91
00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:26.760
now plans to introduce similar lines of
dog clothing to eat into the market share.

92
00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:31.802
Their future goals and plans are to
try to maintain at least a 30% ROE and

93
00:05:31.802 --> 00:05:34.169
11% ROS going into the future.

94
00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:38.240
>> ROE?

95
00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.150
ROS?

96
00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:42.160
Is this accounting analytics or
alphabet soup?

97
00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:47.560
>> Yeah, I'm sorry we're gonna throw
around a lot of abbreviations in

98
00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:48.110
this course.

99
00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:51.100
But don't worry we should
define them all at some point.

100
00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:56.055
In the next video we'll talk about in
more detail what ROE and ROS stand for.

101
00:05:58.101 --> 00:06:01.300
They also want to try to
maintain 20% sales growth.

102
00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.820
They're gonna to try to do this
through new store openings and

103
00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:08.060
enlargement of some of
their existing stores.

104
00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:11.880
They're planning capital expenditures
of about $200 million per year and

105
00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:16.670
a lot of this will be expanding
into European and Asian markets.

106
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:20.650
They want to keep their focus on their
core competencies in dog fashion, but

107
00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:23.700
they are studying possible
expansion into the cat and

108
00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:26.550
ferret markets to try to stave
off some of their competition.

109
00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:33.310
Finally, Woof Junction is considering
launching its own credit card.

110
00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:37.470
Not only might this spur further growth
in sales, but they could also earn

111
00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:41.690
financing income by earning interest
revenue on the credit card receivables.

112
00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:48.810
To do our thorough analysis of
Woof Junction, we're gonna rely a lot

113
00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:52.470
on an excel spreadsheet, which should
be available on the course platform.

114
00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:55.750
In the first tab of that spreadsheet,

115
00:06:55.750 --> 00:07:00.550
I've typed in Woof Junctions financial
statements for the last five years.

116
00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:05.250
So you can see their balance sheet,
their income statement, and

117
00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:06.850
their statement of cash flows.

118
00:07:08.008 --> 00:07:11.730
Now what you should do before you
watch the next video on ratios is

119
00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:14.900
take some time on your own,
look through these financial statements.

120
00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.970
Make sure you understand what
the line items mean, and

121
00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:22.060
then see if you can spot any interesting
trends in the financial statements that

122
00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:25.640
we need to better understand as
we work through the analysis.

123
00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:31.280
That wraps our look at
the overview of Woof Junction.

124
00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:34.590
I can't recommend strongly
enough how important it is for

125
00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:39.060
you to find the spreadsheet that has
all the Woof Junction information.

126
00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:41.140
Start to get familiar
with that spreadsheet,

127
00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:44.970
because we're gonna spend a lot of
time on it in the next few videos.

128
00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:45.690
I'll see you next time.

129
00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:48.676
>> See you next video!
