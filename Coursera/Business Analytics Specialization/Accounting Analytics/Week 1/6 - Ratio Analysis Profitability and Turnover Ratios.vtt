00:00:03.053 --> 00:00:05.560
Hello, I'm professor Brian Bushee,
welcome back.

2
00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:10.702
In this video, we're gonna dig
deeper into Woof Junctions ratios by

3
00:00:10.702 --> 00:00:17.000
looking at sub ratios within
the profitability and turnover categories.

4
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.380
This will allow us to pinpoint what
specifically is going well for

5
00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.830
the profitability, what specifically
is going well for their turn over.

6
00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.980
And tie that back to their strategy.

7
00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.900
So that we can get a sense for
what in Woof Junction's strategy

8
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.650
is really paying off, and giving them
an advantage over their competitors.

9
00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:40.895
Let's get started, we're gonna expand
our DuPont Ration Analysis Framework,

10
00:00:40.895 --> 00:00:46.335
by digging more deeply into
the profitability and efficiency ratios.

11
00:00:46.335 --> 00:00:49.365
So we look at some sub ratios for
profitability and

12
00:00:49.365 --> 00:00:52.765
some sub ratios under Asset Turnover.

13
00:00:52.765 --> 00:00:55.410
So first, we're gonna look
at the Profit Margin Ratios.

14
00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.870
Here, the goal is to figure out,
what are the drivers of profitability?

15
00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.540
So what we're gonna do is
decompose profitability or

16
00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.590
return on sales by various important
income statement line items.

17
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.700
So first,
we're gonna look at gross margin.

18
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.570
That's Gross Profit,
which is sales minus cost of goods sold or

19
00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:19.510
the markup of the selling price over cost
of producing the goods divided by sales.

20
00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:24.150
Then we'll look at the SG&A expense to
sales ratio, that'll give us a sense

21
00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.230
of whether we're controlling all
the other costs of running the business.

22
00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:33.060
We'll look at operating margin, which is
a combination of the mark up over cost,

23
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.114
gross margin, and
all the other expenses, SG&A.

24
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.680
We'll look at interest expense-to-sales to
get a sense of how financing is affecting

25
00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.220
profitability, although that's not part
of the ROS ratio that we calculate.

26
00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:48.760
And then we'll look at
the effective tax rate,

27
00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.830
which is income taxes as
a function of pre-tax income.

28
00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:55.940
>> Seriously?

29
00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.810
I see a mistake on this slide.

30
00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.530
For the effective tax rate, you divided
by pretax income instead of by sales.

31
00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.410
>> No, this is actually not a mistake.

32
00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.580
By dividing income tax expense by
pretax income, we get a tax rate

33
00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.000
which is easier to interpret than
income tax expense to sales.

34
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.640
For instance,

35
00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.880
if we divide by pretax income and
come up with an effective tax rate of 36%.

36
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.490
You could compare that to tax
rate in the company's country and

37
00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.610
state and municipality, and
see whether that seems high or low.

38
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.110
But if I told you their ratio of
income tax expense to sales was 0.5%,

39
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.780
it's much harder to interpret.

40
00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.320
So by putting this as a tax rate,
it's easier for

41
00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.590
us to think about whether it's high or
low for the company.

42
00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.570
So, let's pull up the spreadsheet for
Woof Junction, and

43
00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.760
what we can see is they had
the increasing in return on sales.

44
00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.410
Their profitability over time,

45
00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.950
which we said last video was
the secret to their success.

46
00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.830
Now, we can dig into the sources of
this improvement of profitability

47
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.140
by looking at the different sub ratios.

48
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.690
So first we have gross margin,

49
00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.080
which remember is the selling
price minus the cost of the goods.

50
00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.030
So that gross profit divided by sales,
it's like the markup over cost.

51
00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:20.395
And that has been steadily increasing
over the period from 35% up to 40%.

52
00:03:20.395 --> 00:03:24.030
So that clearly has driven
their profitability.

53
00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.040
What could explain that?

54
00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.810
Well, if we go back to the facts,
the case.

55
00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.850
It could be the strategy
of trying to control costs.

56
00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.550
So remember they have a limited number of
items or a limited number of styles they

57
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.490
keep in stock, which could
control their production costs.

58
00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:45.240
They manufacture their clothing under
a private label using their own suppliers,

59
00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:48.840
and they have a lot of suppliers
which may allow them to.

60
00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.090
Play suppliers off each other to
get really good deals on the cost.

61
00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.820
And also they did the regional
distribution centers.

62
00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:00.850
So that inventory wasn't stuck in stores
where it might be selling slowly.

63
00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:02.500
But instead, was in a warehouse and

64
00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.980
then sent to whatever stores
were selling things quickly.

65
00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.070
And what's striking about this,
they also have this strategy of selling

66
00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:13.680
older stock at reduced prices, slashing
the prices to get it out the door.

67
00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.020
Normally, that would reduce gross margin.

68
00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:19.730
Doesn't seem to be having a major effect
here, which means they've been managing

69
00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:23.640
their old styles really well, so
that they don't have a lot of it.

70
00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.630
The other reason this might be
going up is on the price side.

71
00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.740
So for a given level of cost,
they're able to charge a higher price.

72
00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.190
And this could be the payoff from their
strategies to establish their brand name.

73
00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.310
So they're heavy spent on advertising, and

74
00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.370
celebrity endorsements
could be paying off here.

75
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.920
The next thing we have is SG&A to sales.

76
00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:47.200
So this is the ratio of all the other
expenses of running the business,

77
00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:52.880
sales force, marketing, advertising,
top management, human resources, so forth.

78
00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:58.470
That has been trending upward, and
then it sort of leveled off in 2015.

79
00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.880
So we can not say that controlling
these costs have been a secret to their

80
00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:03.470
profitability.

81
00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:06.460
Actually, these costs have
been starting to creep up.

82
00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.770
And that might make sense,
because any increase in advertising or

83
00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:13.160
promotion costs are gonna
show up in the SG&A.

84
00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:18.066
So it looks like Woof is doing a strategy
where they're willing to incur some extra

85
00:05:18.066 --> 00:05:22.600
SG&A costs in order to get
a higher markup over cost.

86
00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.430
Operating Margin is
the combination of those two,

87
00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:31.070
so it's been trending up, showing
that this increase in gross margin is

88
00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:36.070
more than offsetting
the increased expenses in SG&A.

89
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.360
Then we have interest
expense at percent of sales.

90
00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.630
Fairly flat, not a big deal for Woof.

91
00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:44.240
And then their effective
tax rate shows that they're

92
00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:49.320
paying a slightly lower tax rate,
about 3% over this period.

93
00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.840
We don't have any facts in
the case to tell us what it is.

94
00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.325
But that also will help
their profitability,

95
00:05:54.325 --> 00:05:58.027
if they're able to find ways to
control and reduce their tax burden.

96
00:06:00.869 --> 00:06:05.886
Next, we're gonna look at the sub ratios
under the asset turnover ratio, and

97
00:06:05.886 --> 00:06:11.790
these are gonna tell us how many times per
year do we cycle through a given account.

98
00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:16.150
For example, when we look at inventory
turnover, if the value is eight, it means

99
00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:22.060
that we build and then sell the inventory
eight times during the year, on average.

100
00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:23.530
So, we'll get an accounts
receivable turnover,

101
00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:26.460
which is sales divided by
average accounts receivable.

102
00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:30.360
That will tell us how many times during
the year did we create accounts receivable

103
00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.920
through credit sales, and
then collect the cash.

104
00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:37.560
Inventory turnover is cost of
goods sold over average inventory.

105
00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:41.470
We use cost of goods sold because that's
the cost of the inventory that we sold,

106
00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:45.260
that's what we wanna compare to
the average inventory during the year.

107
00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.330
And I told you how to interpret
that just a second ago.

108
00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:52.730
Accounts payable turnover is purchases
over average accounts payable.

109
00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:56.910
Purchases are the amount of inventory
that we add during the year,

110
00:06:56.910 --> 00:07:00.190
either through manufacturing or
buying the inventory.

111
00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:02.370
And that can be calculated
using this equation here.

112
00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:06.370
Ending inventory + cost of goods
sold- beginning inventory.

113
00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:10.780
What this tells us is how many times
during the year do we create an accounts

114
00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:14.890
payable, because we got something from
a supplier and then eventually pay it off.

115
00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:18.350
And then finally,
we have fixed asset turnover,

116
00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:22.740
which is sales over average net property,
plant, and equipment.

117
00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:26.560
What this is gonna tell us is,
how much sales do we generate for

118
00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.651
our investment in property plant and
equipment?

119
00:07:32.622 --> 00:07:33.410
>> What?

120
00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:36.720
These ratios make about as much sense as?

121
00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:39.100
A Texas turtle buying a parka and mukluks.

122
00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:43.880
>> I completely agree,
not about the Texas Turtle, but

123
00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.900
the fact that these turnover
ratios are hard to interpret.

124
00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:51.530
So let me give another version of these
ratios which I find much more intuitive.

125
00:07:53.600 --> 00:08:00.010
Now, let's transform these asset turnover
ratios into Days Outstanding Ratios.

126
00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:03.440
These ratios are gonna tell us how many
days on average a given account is

127
00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:04.580
outstanding.

128
00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:09.210
For example, if we had days inventory of
45, it means that it takes 45 days, on

129
00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:13.382
average, from the time we start building
inventory until the time that we sell it.

130
00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:18.890
So the first ratio we'll look at, is we'll
transform accounts receivable turnover

131
00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:23.100
into days receivable outstanding or
days sales outstanding.

132
00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:26.470
And the way to do this transformation
is we just take the inverse of

133
00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:30.780
the turnover ratio and
multiply times 365, and voila,

134
00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:35.940
we get this interpretation of number of
days it takes for our customers to pay us.

135
00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:43.070
Days inventory is 365 times
the inventory turnover ratio inverted.

136
00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:47.710
And, as I said before, that's the number
of days it takes to build inventory, and

137
00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:48.930
then hold it until we sell it.

138
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.150
Days payable, same idea.

139
00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:56.623
It'll give us the number of days it
generally takes us to pay our suppliers

140
00:08:56.623 --> 00:08:59.668
after we receive something
from them on account.

141
00:09:02.571 --> 00:09:05.480
>> Dude what do you like do in leap years?

142
00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:08.090
They have 366 days, you know.

143
00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:14.570
>> So when I first learned these ratios,
I was taught to use 360 days, not 365,

144
00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:21.430
because 360 made it much easier to do
the calculations on our slide rules.

145
00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:26.530
So, these are only rough approximations
and if you ignore the day in a leap year,

146
00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:29.590
you'll be fine,
as long as you ignore it consistently for

147
00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:31.730
all the companies that you
look at with these ratios.

148
00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:37.630
Then, we can put these
three days ratios together

149
00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:40.490
into something called the Net Trade Cycle.

150
00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:44.140
And the Net Trade Cycle is gonna represent
the gap between cash outflows and

151
00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:48.220
cash inflows, that we would have to
bridge with short-term borrowing.

152
00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:52.410
It's defined as days receivable
+ days inventory- days payable.

153
00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:55.000
Let me show you
the interpretation of this.

154
00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.250
So at some point as a business,
you get raw materials from suppliers.

155
00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:02.220
And then you owe them money
under accounts payable.

156
00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:05.960
You would take those raw materials,
turn them into finished goods,

157
00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:07.030
sell those finished goods.

158
00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:09.950
And the number of days it takes you
to do that is your days inventory.

159
00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:14.770
So let's say it's 50 days, it means
from the moment you get raw materials,

160
00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:18.090
it's 50 days on average until
you sell the inventory.

161
00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:20.470
When you sell the inventory,
you don't get cash yet.

162
00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:22.790
Instead, you sell it on
account to customers, and

163
00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:24.490
you have accounts receivable.

164
00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:28.230
The days receivable tells you how
many more days it's gonna take

165
00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:30.450
until you finally collect cash.

166
00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:34.080
So, let's say its 30 days, so
that would mean it's 80 days total.

167
00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:37.919
From when you first get raw materials to
when you collect cash from customers.

168
00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:42.870
Then on the other side of the cash
equation you have to pay your suppliers.

169
00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:47.290
So the Days Payable's the number of
days it takes you to pay your supplier,

170
00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:52.050
that's when you have cash going out,
so let's say that's 35 days.

171
00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:54.800
What that leads to is a Net Trade Cycle,

172
00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:58.420
which is the gap between when
you get cash in from customers.

173
00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:02.050
And when you pay cash out to your
suppliers, in this case, it's 45 days.

174
00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:07.661
And so what that represents is you'd
have to go to a bank to borrow money for

175
00:11:07.661 --> 00:11:10.843
45 days to bridge this gap in cash flow.

176
00:11:12.902 --> 00:11:17.876
So let's take a look at the breakdown
of the Asset Turnover ratios for

177
00:11:17.876 --> 00:11:19.780
Woof Junction.

178
00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:21.360
As we saw last video,

179
00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:26.430
there wasn't much terms of a clear
trend in their Asset Turnover overall.

180
00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:29.160
But that doesn't mean that there's
not interesting stuff going on in

181
00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:30.900
the sub-components.

182
00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:34.790
So I give you both the turnover ratios and
the day's ratio.

183
00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:37.350
You can choose whichever
one you want to look at.

184
00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:38.790
I'm gonna focus on the days ratio.

185
00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:42.690
So for Woof,
the Days Receivables are minuscule.

186
00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:47.820
It's 1.3 days from when they make
the sale to when they collect the cash.

187
00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:48.515
Why is it so low?

188
00:11:48.515 --> 00:11:50.680
Cuz they don't have their own credit card.

189
00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:53.530
They don't provide their
own credit to customers.

190
00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:58.270
All of their sales are either cash or
outside vendor credit cards like Visa,

191
00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:00.180
Master Card, American Express.

192
00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:04.200
In which case, even though the customer
may not pay their Visa bill for

193
00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:07.680
30 months, Visa pays Woof Junction
within a couple days.

194
00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:13.510
So this is something that if they ever
decided to add their own credit card,

195
00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:15.070
this days receivable
would certainly go up.

196
00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:21.660
Days Inventory, so this is
the number of days that you have to

197
00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:28.720
hold the inventory until it sells has
gone from 87 days down to 68 days.

198
00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:33.580
So an improvement of almost 20 days
in terms of holding inventory.

199
00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:38.820
This we could probably attribute
to their point of sale technology,

200
00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:43.390
where they're trying not to hold a lot
of inventory stuck in these malls.

201
00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:45.980
But instead,
have it in a central place, and

202
00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:48.860
then farm it out to the places
that are really selling it.

203
00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:51.540
Also, this reflects their strategy of

204
00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:54.700
slashing prices to get rid of
old stock every two months.

205
00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:56.969
So they just don't hold inventory for
a long period of time.

206
00:12:58.230 --> 00:13:01.570
Days Payable, the number of days it
takes them to pay their suppliers.

207
00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:06.030
It's hung constant around 30 days,
so not much going on here.

208
00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:10.820
Putting those together, the Net Trade
Cycle, used to be it took about 55

209
00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:15.910
days of bank borrowing, to bridge this
gap between cash outflow and cash inflow.

210
00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:18.060
Now, it's drooped to 37 days.

211
00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:22.968
And that's pretty much all driven by their
improvement in their days inventory.

212
00:13:22.968 --> 00:13:25.565
One turnover ratio I will look at,

213
00:13:25.565 --> 00:13:29.560
cuz we don't have it in days
form is Fixed Asset Turnover.

214
00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:34.980
So this represents the amount of sales
that Woof is able to generate for

215
00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:37.160
their investment and
property plant equipment.

216
00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:39.500
It's actually going down over time.

217
00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:43.590
Which normally would be bad news, cuz
you're not generating as much sales for

218
00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:45.590
your investment in P, P and E.

219
00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:47.945
But in the case of Woof,
it's a little more complicated.

220
00:13:47.945 --> 00:13:52.230
Cuz they're growing rapidly,
adding a lot of new stores.

221
00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:55.390
And what might happen, is there's
a little bit of delay where there's

222
00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:58.980
big capital expenditure
to add stores this year.

223
00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:02.570
But it may take a couple years for
the sales to materialize.

224
00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:06.070
So this is something that we would hope
would rebound and come up in the future.

225
00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:09.650
But right now, it may be depressed by
their heavy investment in the new stores.

226
00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:19.080
Before we wrap up, we should compare the
ratio's for Woof junction to Ooh La Lab.

227
00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:21.760
And to the industry group as a whole.

228
00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:25.890
And what I'll do is we'll both show
the most recent year and the average.

229
00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:28.240
The most recent year is interesting
because there have been these upward

230
00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:30.500
trends in some of these ratios.

231
00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:34.910
So first, we find that Woof has a much
higher gross margin than Ooh La Lab and

232
00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:36.590
the industry as a whole.

233
00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:39.310
And while Woof has had
increasing gross margins,

234
00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:41.750
we don't see that in the comparators.

235
00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:45.420
So this shows that a big source
of Woof's advantage right now,

236
00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:47.045
is this markup over cost.

237
00:14:47.045 --> 00:14:51.475
Woof has a higher SG&A of
sales than Ooh La Lab, but

238
00:14:51.475 --> 00:14:54.970
lower than the specialty group.

239
00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:59.150
Part of what's going on here,
is Woof is spending more on advertising.

240
00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:02.870
And so they're gonna have
higher SG&A than Ooh La Lab.

241
00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:06.420
When we compare the operating margins,
the average is the same,

242
00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:12.130
although Woof has higher operating
margin in 2015 than Ooh La Lab.

243
00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:15.510
And so what that's saying
is the extra advertising

244
00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:18.480
is being offset by the improvements
in gross margin, and so

245
00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:21.910
they end up having a higher
operating margin than Ooh La Lab.

246
00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:24.940
Then if we look at the effective tax rate,
it's actually,

247
00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:29.770
on average, higher for
Woof than Oh La Lab.

248
00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:33.290
Although Oh La Lab has had
a lot of volatility in this.

249
00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:37.860
But I think you can say these are fairly
comparable, and that Woof's big

250
00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:41.900
advantage over its competition is it's
able to get this higher gross margin.

251
00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:44.790
If we look at the days ratios,

252
00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:51.560
we find that days receivables much lower
for Woof than Ooh La Lab in the industry.

253
00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:54.880
That's because Ooh La Lab
has a credit card.

254
00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:58.030
I mean, who doesn't have a Ooh La Lab
credit card at this point?

255
00:15:58.030 --> 00:16:00.050
Whereas Woof hasn't done that yet.

256
00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:05.405
So that's why there a big advantage for
Woof in terms of lower days receivable.

257
00:16:05.405 --> 00:16:08.730
Days Inventory, even though it's
been trending downward for Woof,

258
00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:12.090
it's higher than Ooh La Lab.

259
00:16:12.090 --> 00:16:15.860
Days payable is sort of similar,
it's a little bit longer for Woof.

260
00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:19.400
If we look at the Net Trade Cycle,
substantially lower for

261
00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:21.330
Woof, then it is for Ooh La Lab.

262
00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:26.100
And what's going on here, is even though
they have the inventory, but longer not

263
00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:31.990
having their own credit card causes them
to not borrow as much as Ooh La Lab.

264
00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:35.310
On the other hand, Woof is not
getting the credit card income.

265
00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:37.650
So one of the things Woof
has to think strategically,

266
00:16:37.650 --> 00:16:39.450
is if they add the credit card.

267
00:16:39.450 --> 00:16:42.960
They'll get credit card income, but
they're gonna have to borrow from the bank

268
00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:46.420
a bit longer,
because their days receivable will go up.

269
00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:50.670
But overall, we can see that Woof has
made good progress in their inventory,

270
00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:53.490
still not as good a shape,
though, as Ooh La Lab.

271
00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:57.710
And the big advantage in their
profitability is this gross margin,

272
00:16:57.710 --> 00:16:58.970
which is substantially higher.

273
00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:05.910
So, the ratio analysis so far has shown us
that Woof's big advantage in profitability

274
00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:11.060
is the goals margin, and
that ties back to their branding strategy.

275
00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:15.180
Which allows them to charge a higher
price for their goods and to their cost

276
00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:19.100
containment strategy, which is reducing
the production costs for their goods.

277
00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:23.070
Now, the ratio analysis can't tell us
which one of those two is more important,

278
00:17:23.070 --> 00:17:26.950
or much they are contributing
to gross margin.

279
00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:30.050
But at least we're at the point
where we know to try to gather more

280
00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:30.990
information about that.

281
00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:33.340
Either, if we have a chance
to ask management or

282
00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:37.300
to try to read about this in competitors,
or other sources.

283
00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:39.900
To try to figure out what it really
driving the advantage for Woof.

284
00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:43.190
Is it branding, cost containment or both?

285
00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:47.680
Similarly, the efficiency analysis has
shown us that Woof has great advantages in

286
00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:51.740
their low days receivable, and
their improving inventory turnover.

287
00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:55.450
Which again, we can tie back to
specific parts of their strategy.

288
00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:59.440
But the ratio analysis won't tell us how
sustainable those are into the future.

289
00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:02.660
But at least, it's highlighted
that we need to figure out,

290
00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:07.850
can Woof sustain it's low days receivable,
it's improvement and inventory turnover?

291
00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:11.210
In order for
it to have these advantages going forward.

292
00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:15.710
So that wraps up our look at
the profitability and efficiency of Woof.

293
00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:19.540
In the next video, we're gonna turn
our attention to liquidity ratios.

294
00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:22.220
I'll see you then.

295
00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:23.149
>> See you next video.
