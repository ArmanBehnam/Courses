00:00:03.828 --> 00:00:06.460
Hello, I'm Professor Brian Bushee,
welcome back.

2
00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:09.800
In this video, we're gonna talk
about accounting based valuation.

3
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.740
In other words, how to use
accounting numbers to come up with

4
00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.440
what a company's stock price should be.

5
00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.230
I debated quite a while about whether I
should include this video in the course.

6
00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.760
On the one hand, once you get the
forecasted financial statements, there's

7
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.670
not much more you need to do, before you
can come up with a valuation number.

8
00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.510
On the other hand, there are whole courses
devoted to valuation, and in this short

9
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.070
video I can barely scratch the surface of
all the things you need to think about.

10
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.510
So I decided to put together
this video and make it optional.

11
00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.060
So you don't have to know this.

12
00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:48.230
I would suggest watching this if you
have had prior courses in valuation,

13
00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:49.910
cuz then it'll make sense.

14
00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.790
Or if you haven't, then maybe
come back to this video after you

15
00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.650
have taken a course in valuation, and
it'll make a lot more sense at that point.

16
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.070
Anyway, let's get started.

17
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.010
Based on well accepted theoretical models,

18
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.250
the stock price of a company should
be equal to the present value of

19
00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.830
all future dividends that the company
pays, discounted at the cost of capital.

20
00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:15.770
So here's the equation.

21
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.900
It's called the Dividend Discount Model.

22
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:23.270
The stock price, which is p at time 0,
equals the sum all the way out to infinity

23
00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.860
of all dividends, that's Dt,
discounted at the cost of capital, r.

24
00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:32.820
>> Discounted?

25
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.260
Cost of capital?

26
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.980
Is that an infinity sign?

27
00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.110
What the deuce are you talking about?

28
00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.690
Is that a sigma?

29
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.330
This is certainly Greek to me.

30
00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.710
>> Okay, I figured that some of you
that have no background in valuation or

31
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.500
time valued money,
would decide to watch the video anyway.

32
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.430
So I put together about a three
minute example to try to show

33
00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.710
you what's the thought
process behind valuation.

34
00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.150
So if you have never
seen valuation before,

35
00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.720
this example will hopefully give
you an example of how it works.

36
00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.990
If you have seen valuation, then maybe
what you wanna do is just fast forward

37
00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.500
about three minutes, and pick this back
up when you see a PowerPoint slide again.

38
00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.470
Let's say I'd be willing
to give you $100 today.

39
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.602
How much would you pay me for that $100?

40
00:02:21.602 --> 00:02:23.274
Well, you'd probably pay me $100,

41
00:02:23.274 --> 00:02:26.600
because you certainly wouldn't wanna
pay me more than $100 to get $100.

42
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.270
And I certainly wouldn't
accept less than that.

43
00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.090
What's a more complicated question,
if I gonna give

44
00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.900
you $100 next year,
how much would you pay for that today?

45
00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.774
Well, you wouldn’t necessarily
want to pay me $100,

46
00:02:43.774 --> 00:02:46.823
because you could spend
that money on yourself.

47
00:02:46.823 --> 00:02:49.650
So I need to give you some compensation
for waiting to get your money back.

48
00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.400
You certainly wouldn’t
want to give me $100,

49
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.120
because there’s some risk of inflation,
so I’d have to compensate you for

50
00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.510
the fact that $100 next year may not
buy as much stuff as $100 today.

51
00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.270
And I'd probably have to compensate you
for the risk that I won't pay you back.

52
00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.050
Maybe I'll disappear a year from now and

53
00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.723
you'll never get your money back,
so you might only pay me $95.

54
00:03:13.723 --> 00:03:16.710
And what that represents
is a rate of return of 5%.

55
00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:22.100
So you pay me $95 today,
I give you a $100 next year.

56
00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.650
You've earned a 5% rate of return,
which we also call the discount rate,

57
00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.920
which is a compensation for
these three factors.

58
00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:35.411
Now let's say I'm gonna give you $100,
20 years from now.

59
00:03:35.411 --> 00:03:37.390
How much are you gonna pay me today?

60
00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.630
Well it should be way less than $95,

61
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:46.110
because those risks of inflation,
and that I won't pay you back.

62
00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.080
And also the compensation for
waiting 20 years to get your money,

63
00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.560
should be higher, so
maybe you're only gonna pay me $38.

64
00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.530
Which again reflects a 5% rate of return.

65
00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.770
So you give me $38 today,
I give you $100 20 years from now,

66
00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:05.310
that represents a 5% growth
in your money each year.

67
00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.840
So now we're valuing a company, and

68
00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.920
what a company is gonna give you
is dividends out to infinity.

69
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.570
Now I don't have room for
infinity on my spreadsheet, so

70
00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.240
I'm gonna sort of cut out some columns.

71
00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:23.900
So how much would you be willing to pay to
get $100 a year of dividends to infinity?

72
00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.050
Well, the first thing you have to do is
translate back to today's dollars at 5%.

73
00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.609
So here's our 100 goes down
to $95 in today's dollars.

74
00:04:32.609 --> 00:04:35.213
And as you see, as it gets more and
more years out,

75
00:04:35.213 --> 00:04:40.130
like 50 or 100 years, it's not worth that
much to get $100, 100 years from now.

76
00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:43.430
It's only worth about $1 today.

77
00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.250
And so
what you would be willing to pay me,

78
00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:50.690
is basically the present value of that,
at this discount rate of 5%.

79
00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:54.060
That's all that it is to it for
valuing a company,

80
00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:59.150
is you look at the dividends the company
is expected to pay out over its lifetime.

81
00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:04.280
And then you discount them back at some
rate, which we call the cost of capital.

82
00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.841
That cost of capital reflects this
inflation, the compensation for waiting to

83
00:05:08.841 --> 00:05:13.482
get your money back, and most importantly,
the risk of investing in the stock.

84
00:05:15.306 --> 00:05:18.816
The problem with the dividend discount
model, is that it's hard to forecast

85
00:05:18.816 --> 00:05:23.580
dividends into the future, especially if a
company is not paying dividends right now.

86
00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.220
Also, dividends are measuring
wealth distribution, and

87
00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:31.140
it would be nice to have this in terms of
managers doing something to create wealth.

88
00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:37.040
So, an equivalent model is that the stock
price equals the current financial assets,

89
00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:40.150
plus the present value of
all future free cash flows.

90
00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.900
Where free cash flow is
the cash flow from operations,

91
00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.900
minus the cash flow from
investing activity.

92
00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.740
Here's the equation called
the discounted cash flow model, or DCF.

93
00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.980
If you take a finance related valuation
course, this is what they'll teach you.

94
00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:58.410
But there's also an equivalent model
that only uses accounting numbers.

95
00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:01.640
So this one is that
the stock price of a company

96
00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:06.350
equals the current stockholders equity,
also known as the book value,

97
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:09.740
plus the present value of all
future abnormal earnings.

98
00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:16.290
Abnormal earnings are defined as earnings
minus the prior book value times r.

99
00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:17.120
So the idea here,

100
00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:22.180
is whatever the company's book value is,
should grow by r or the cost of capital.

101
00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:26.130
If the manager provides earnings above
that amount, they've created value.

102
00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:29.630
If they provide earnings below that
amount, they've destroyed value.

103
00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:32.200
And so we get an accounting
based evaluation equation,

104
00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:37.720
which is the stock price for company
equals its stock holders equity today.

105
00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:42.730
Plus the discounted present value
of all these abnormal earnings.

106
00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:45.630
So these are equivalent if
you go out to infinity.

107
00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:49.328
However most people can't go out
to infinity in their forecasts.

108
00:06:49.328 --> 00:06:51.230
So there are finite
versions of the models,

109
00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:55.300
where you do it after five years or ten
years of forecasts, and there you get very

110
00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:58.920
different answers, because of differences
in the quality of the projections.

111
00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:01.960
And researchers found that
the accounting-based valuation actually

112
00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:02.826
performs the best.

113
00:07:04.985 --> 00:07:06.350
>> Seriously?

114
00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:08.560
The accounting model works the best?

115
00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:11.460
You're just saying that because
you are an accounting professor.

116
00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:15.590
>> No, no, no, there's been research that
has shown that these accounting based

117
00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:18.000
evaluation models work the best.

118
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.920
And of course, I'm telling you about that,
because I am an Accounting professor.

119
00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:24.190
But there is a solid rationale for
why that would be the case.

120
00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:28.960
So the whole idea of accrual accounting
is to try to capture business activities.

121
00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:32.460
Not the timing of cash flows,
which can be somewhat arbitrary.

122
00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:37.010
Plus accrual accounting has all these
estimates of the future, bad debt expense,

123
00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:38.379
depreciation expense.

124
00:07:38.379 --> 00:07:43.028
Which try to capture value creation
during the period more effectively than

125
00:07:43.028 --> 00:07:45.306
a free cashflow or dividends would.

126
00:07:45.306 --> 00:07:49.527
So because accounting picks up more of
this value creation in the short term,

127
00:07:49.527 --> 00:07:53.194
and it's easier to forecast things in
the short term than the in the long term.

128
00:07:53.194 --> 00:07:57.770
The accounting based evaluation
models tend to show smaller

129
00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:02.210
errors than the other two models, but
just don't tell your finance professor.

130
00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:07.660
So here are the steps that we need to
follow to do accounting-based valuation.

131
00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:11.610
The first step is to construct the pro
forma financial statements over some

132
00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:14.520
finite horizon forecasting
out into the future.

133
00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:17.560
And then check to see whether
the statements and the ratios make sense.

134
00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:20.310
And this is what we looked at
doing in the forecasting video.

135
00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:24.260
The next step is to use those
statements to compute these

136
00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.340
abnormal earnings over the finite horizon.

137
00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:29.820
And again, we're only gonna go out five
to ten years, because there's not much

138
00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:34.380
benefit to forecasting beyond ten years,
because it's not gonna be that accurate.

139
00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:38.650
But then we have to make some assumption
about terminal value at the end of

140
00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:39.690
the forecast horizon.

141
00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:44.200
So, we're only forecasting out ten years,
but we need the value out to infinity.

142
00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:45.520
So we need to figure out essentially,

143
00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:49.380
what's the value of the company at
the end of this forecast horizon?

144
00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:52.230
One way we might do this is to assume that

145
00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:55.530
the abnormal earnings in the last
year of the forecast horizon

146
00:08:55.530 --> 00:09:00.300
will just continue to grow as a perpetuity
at the long-term rate of sales growth.

147
00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:02.714
And here is the equation if you
wanna make that assumption.

148
00:09:04.977 --> 00:09:09.714
>> Dude, can I ignore this terminal value
nonsense and just use your spreadsheet?

149
00:09:11.618 --> 00:09:14.510
>> Yeah, same caveat I gave last video.

150
00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:19.090
I've got all the equations and technical
stuff there for people who appreciate it.

151
00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:23.070
But if you're someone that doesn't
really like the math, not a problem.

152
00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:26.450
The spreadsheet has the formulas built in,
and you don't have to worry about it.

153
00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:31.620
Once you have all of the forecasted
abnormal earnings, and the forecasted

154
00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:35.640
terminal value, you want to compute
the present value of those amounts.

155
00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:38.340
So bring those back to today's dollars,

156
00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:41.820
using the cost of capital
to estimate present value.

157
00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:44.790
Now I'm not gonna talk about how
to get the cost of capital for

158
00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:46.470
a company in this course.

159
00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:49.910
There are entire courses devoted to this,
and

160
00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:53.560
you need a lot of time to talk about
how to come up with a cost of capital.

161
00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:56.500
So I strongly encourage you to
take some of those other courses

162
00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:58.989
to figure out what's the right
cost of capital to use.

163
00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:02.530
Then we can add the present
value of abnormal earnings,

164
00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:06.010
the present value of the terminal
value of current shareholders' equity,

165
00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:07.820
to get the estimated
market value of equity.

166
00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:11.211
And then divide that by shares
outstanding, and we have stock price.

167
00:10:13.532 --> 00:10:16.578
Okay, let's take a look at
the Woof Junction spreadsheet and

168
00:10:16.578 --> 00:10:18.050
see how the valuation works.

169
00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:21.510
Remember step one was
to do the pro formas,

170
00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:23.660
which we did in the forecasting video.

171
00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:26.630
And to make sure that they make sense.

172
00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:31.770
So, based on the assumptions you entered,
do you end up with the growth and

173
00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:33.750
net income that you expected to see?

174
00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:35.194
Take a look at the ratios.

175
00:10:35.194 --> 00:10:39.590
Do the various ratios for
ROE, ROA profitability.

176
00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:43.160
Do they look like what you expected
to see based on your assumptions?

177
00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:46.430
If so, then you've probably
got the forecasting correct.

178
00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:51.990
The you go to the valuation tab, and
you have to enter in the discount rate or

179
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:53.240
cost of capital.

180
00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:56.180
So again, I'm not gonna tell you how to
compute this, but I will tell you for

181
00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:58.029
Woof Junction that it's 15%.

182
00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:00.310
Then what the spreadsheet does,

183
00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:04.750
is it pulls in all of the actual earnings
that you forecasted in the pro forma.

184
00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:08.200
So if we go back to the pro forma,
we go up to net income.

185
00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:09.990
It's pulling in this net income or

186
00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:13.260
earnings, then we have to
calculate expected earnings.

187
00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.490
That's this rate of return 15%,

188
00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:18.980
times whatever stock holder equity
was at the beginning of the period.

189
00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:21.690
So that's what earnings
you should have earned,

190
00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:25.110
if you're providing
shareholders their 15% return.

191
00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:28.280
The difference between actual and
expected are abnormal earnings, and

192
00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:31.260
this is where Woof Junction
is creating value.

193
00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:36.854
Then we take the present value of those
annual abnormal earnings at the 15%.

194
00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:39.150
We have to do a terminal value.

195
00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:43.074
So for our terminal value, using
the equation I briefly showed you before,

196
00:11:43.074 --> 00:11:45.536
you pull in the last year
of abnormal earnings.

197
00:11:45.536 --> 00:11:50.417
You assume some kind of growth rate
beyond the forecast horizon, and

198
00:11:50.417 --> 00:11:53.540
then come up with
the present value of that.

199
00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:56.220
And now you have three components,

200
00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:59.350
you have the book value of
Woof at the end of 2015.

201
00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:03.100
The present value of all of
these abnormal earnings, and

202
00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:06.000
the present value of this terminal value.

203
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.885
You add those three up, and
you get an estimated market value,

204
00:12:09.885 --> 00:12:14.808
which we divide by shares outstanding
to get a price per share of $22.21.

205
00:12:14.808 --> 00:12:22.120
So based on all of the assumptions that we
made earlier on, the price should be $22.

206
00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:25.810
Which is interesting, because do you
remember what the stock price is for

207
00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:28.208
Woof Junction at the time of the case?

208
00:12:28.208 --> 00:12:33.282
It's $55 a share,
which either means that if our assumptions

209
00:12:33.282 --> 00:12:37.342
are pretty accurate,
if we're pretty confident,

210
00:12:37.342 --> 00:12:43.726
then the stock market may be over-valuing
Woof Junction by about $30 a share.

211
00:12:43.726 --> 00:12:47.440
Or it could mean that our assumptions
are not realistic enough,

212
00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:51.590
and we need to change them to reflect
what the market is thinking about.

213
00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:55.960
So let's try to run this
the other direction.

214
00:12:55.960 --> 00:13:00.440
And see what assumptions would
we need to make in order to get

215
00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:03.090
the current stock price of $55.

216
00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:07.090
Which would tell us what must be some
of the expectations that the stock

217
00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:10.270
market has for
Woof Junction going forward.

218
00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:12.710
So go back to the assumptions tab.

219
00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:16.810
We had forecasted historical
average sales growth of 24%.

220
00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:18.750
But sales growth in their
last year was 30%, so

221
00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:24.135
why don't we change this to 30% and
see what happens to the price?

222
00:13:24.135 --> 00:13:26.070
$26, uh-oh.

223
00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:29.606
Well, maybe instead of
5% growth beyond that,

224
00:13:29.606 --> 00:13:34.410
they're still gonna have 10%
growth going on to perpetuity.

225
00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:36.057
Let's see what that does.

226
00:13:36.057 --> 00:13:37.750
$44, still not enough.

227
00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:40.910
Well, cost to get sold.

228
00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:43.880
This is the historical average
of their cost to get sold.

229
00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:50.105
But what we saw in the prior video is that
it had gone down to 60% in the last year,

230
00:13:50.105 --> 00:13:57.060
so why don't we give them 60% instead
of 62%, and there you go, $56.

231
00:13:57.060 --> 00:14:01.280
So what this is saying is maybe it's
some of these other assumptions, but

232
00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:05.310
it's probably the case that
the stock market is expecting a lot

233
00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:10.470
more sales growth out of Woof Junction
than we originally forecasted.

234
00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:12.820
And now we can do
the same thought process.

235
00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:17.430
Where if we're comfortable that Woof
can deliver 30% sales growth for

236
00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:22.170
the next five years, 10% beyond that,
then the stock price is right.

237
00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:25.710
But if we think their sales growth
isn't gonna be quite as high,

238
00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:28.170
then maybe their stock
price is overvalued.

239
00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:37.040
And that wraps up our week long look at
ratio analysis forecasting and valuation,

240
00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:43.520
where we took a real deep dive to try to
understand one company Woof Junction.

241
00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:45.770
What were the drivers of their success?

242
00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:50.630
What would their success look like if
we tried to forecast into the future,

243
00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:54.870
and is the stock price for
Woof over or under valued?

244
00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:58.590
So what I would recommend now
is take the spreadsheet and

245
00:14:58.590 --> 00:15:00.900
find another company you're interested in.

246
00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:04.730
Type their financial statements
into the first tab, the ratio

247
00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:08.750
tab will do the calculations for you,
then play around with the assumptions,

248
00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:12.600
come up with a pro forma
forecasted set of statements.

249
00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:14.590
Come up with a valuation and
see what you learn.

250
00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:18.861
And if you like it,
maybe I'll see you next week.

251
00:15:18.861 --> 00:15:20.963
See you next time.

252
00:15:20.963 --> 00:15:22.983
>> See you next video.
