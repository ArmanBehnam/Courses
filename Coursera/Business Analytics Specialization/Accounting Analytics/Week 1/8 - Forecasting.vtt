00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:05.200
Hello, I'm professor Brian Bushee.

2
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.340
Welcome back.

3
00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.078
In this video,
we're gonna take a look at forecasting.

4
00:00:09.078 --> 00:00:12.504
We're gonna see how you could use
a company's historical financial

5
00:00:12.504 --> 00:00:15.341
statements in order to forecast
future balance sheets,

6
00:00:15.341 --> 00:00:18.420
income statements and
cash flow statements.

7
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.720
We're gonna start by putting together
something called common size financial

8
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.440
statements from the historical
financial statements.

9
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:29.099
We can use these common size statements
along with sales growth forecasts,

10
00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.778
in order to forecast all three of
the financial statements into the future.

11
00:00:33.778 --> 00:00:36.491
Once we have those forecasted statements,

12
00:00:36.491 --> 00:00:40.159
then we can tweak assumptions for
individual line items and

13
00:00:40.159 --> 00:00:44.810
see how that would effect all
of the forecasted statements.

14
00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:45.590
Let's get started.

15
00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:49.860
Before we start to work on forecasting,

16
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.510
the first thing we need to do is talk
about common size financial statements.

17
00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.570
There are a couple benefits to doing
common size financial statements.

18
00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.784
One is it's gonna remove
the effects of growth,

19
00:00:58.784 --> 00:01:01.918
which will help you better spot
trends in the financial statements.

20
00:01:01.918 --> 00:01:04.396
So, one of the problems is
that growth in assets or

21
00:01:04.396 --> 00:01:08.231
growth in sales drives almost all of the
trends in the line items on the balance

22
00:01:08.231 --> 00:01:11.350
sheet and income statement respectively.

23
00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.040
So we're gonna use common sizing to
take out that growth which allows to see

24
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.920
whether certain line items on the balance
sheet or income statement are growing

25
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.970
more or less that we'd expect given
the total growth in assets and sales.

26
00:01:24.005 --> 00:01:27.719
The second benefit is it's gonna help us
put together forecasted future financial

27
00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:28.363
statements.

28
00:01:28.363 --> 00:01:33.572
What you're gonna see is we're gonna
combine historical common size statements

29
00:01:33.572 --> 00:01:38.643
with growth forecasts of sales and
assets to get future financial statements.

30
00:01:38.643 --> 00:01:42.259
So, we're gonna put together a common size
balance sheet in which we express all

31
00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:45.750
numbers on the balance sheet as
a percentage of total assets.

32
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.250
A common sized income statement where we
express all the numbers on the income

33
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.640
statement as a percentage of sales.

34
00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.793
And then the cash flow statement
is typically not common sized.

35
00:01:57.213 --> 00:02:00.993
>> I have an intense dislike for
the Cash Flow Statement.

36
00:02:00.993 --> 00:02:04.020
I am so
glad we do not have to common size it.

37
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.870
>> But what is the rationale for doing so?

38
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.700
>> There are a couple reasons why we don't
do common sized cash flow statements.

39
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.920
The first is that there's not an obvious
number to use to common size it.

40
00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.758
I mean, we could use the change in cash,
but if that was close to zero,

41
00:02:19.758 --> 00:02:22.833
then the common size ratios
would be close to infinity.

42
00:02:22.833 --> 00:02:25.938
Or if the change in cash was negative and
one of the line items was negative,

43
00:02:25.938 --> 00:02:28.090
you'd end up with a positive number.

44
00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.040
So it would be hard to interpret
if we tried to common size.

45
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.214
The second reason is we don't really need
to common size the cash flow of statement

46
00:02:35.214 --> 00:02:39.449
to forecast it because if we forecast the
income statement and forecast the balance

47
00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:43.466
sheet, we can use those two together to
put together the cash flow statement.

48
00:02:43.466 --> 00:02:47.707
In a sense the cash flow statement is
redundant because it's just a combination

49
00:02:47.707 --> 00:02:49.300
of the other two statements.

50
00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.110
If you take a look at the Woof Junction
spreadsheet, there is a tab for

51
00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.180
common size finance statements.

52
00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.885
Here's the commons size balance sheet and
what I've done, and you can check this

53
00:03:00.885 --> 00:03:05.454
with the formulas, is taken original value
of each line item divided it by total

54
00:03:05.454 --> 00:03:10.188
assets to get the percent of total assets
which is why total assets is equal to one.

55
00:03:10.188 --> 00:03:12.775
Same thing with total liabilities and
equity because that has

56
00:03:12.775 --> 00:03:16.220
to equal total assets that hold
balance sheet equation thing.

57
00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.650
And so what this allows you
to do is look at trends and

58
00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.500
line items where you've taken
out growth in the company.

59
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.820
So we can see inventory has gone down
as a percent of assets over time.

60
00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.480
For the income statement we divide
all the line items by sales.

61
00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.230
So you can see sales
has a value of one and

62
00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.240
everything else is a percentage of sales.

63
00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.920
And you've seen a lot of
these before because these

64
00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.760
are basically the profitability
sub-ratios that we looked at earlier,

65
00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.440
where we took a lot of these line
items as a percent of sales.

66
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.050
And then we don't common size
the cash flow statement.

67
00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.950
Now that we've put together common
size historical balance sheets and

68
00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.910
income statements, we can now
forecast future financial statements.

69
00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.070
And another word for

70
00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:03.890
projected future financial
statements is pro forma statements.

71
00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:05.960
So I'll use those terms interchangeably.

72
00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:09.620
Step one is to forecast future sales.

73
00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.234
All of the other line items
on the balance sheet and

74
00:04:12.234 --> 00:04:16.353
the income statement are going to be
a function of our future sales forecasts.

75
00:04:18.593 --> 00:04:19.740
>> Wait.

76
00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:22.329
How on earth does one forecast sales?

77
00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.380
>> I'm glad you said how on
Earth do we forecast sales,

78
00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.100
because I was about to tell
you how to do it on Mars.

79
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.510
So, forecasting sales is obviously tricky,

80
00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.160
because we're trying to
forecast the future.

81
00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.280
The best starting point is
historical sales growth.

82
00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.600
Then adjust that for

83
00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.070
any additional information you
have about future prospects.

84
00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:46.840
So if the company has some good growth
opportunity as your plan's in place,

85
00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.720
maybe you make sales growth
higher than historical, or

86
00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.780
if they seemed to have reached the limits
of their growth potential or expansion,

87
00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.520
then maybe you make sales growth in the
future lower than it's been historically.

88
00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.410
There's a lot more art than
science to it and ultimately,

89
00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:04.570
what you wanna do is play around
with different forecast assumptions.

90
00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:09.120
So in the spreadsheet, it's easy to try
different sales forecast assumptions and

91
00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:14.710
see how it affects all of your
forecasted future financial statements.

92
00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.890
Step two,
we can use our forecasted sales for

93
00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:21.780
each year in the future to put
together pro forma income statements.

94
00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.460
So all we need to do is take
the forecasted sales for

95
00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.030
the year, times those forecasted
common size ratios for

96
00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:32.060
each line item to get the value of each
line item on the income statement.

97
00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:36.050
For example, if we wanted to
forecast SG&A expense, we would take

98
00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:40.530
forecasted sales for the year,
times the forecasted SG&A to sales ratio.

99
00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:47.028
Step three is we can use forecasted sales
to construct a pro forma balance sheet.

100
00:05:47.028 --> 00:05:49.890
I'm gonna have to show you
that on the next slide.

101
00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:53.120
And then the final step is we can use
the pro forma income statement and

102
00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:57.630
pro forma balance sheets to construct
a pro forma statement of cash flows.

103
00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.449
So let's talk about how to
project the balance sheet.

104
00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:07.346
So we can take our forecasted sales and
use the total asset turnover

105
00:06:07.346 --> 00:06:11.848
ratio to forecast for future total
assets at the end of the year.

106
00:06:11.848 --> 00:06:15.948
And that's because the turnover ratio,
if you remember,

107
00:06:15.948 --> 00:06:18.740
is a ratio of sales to assets.

108
00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:24.910
So the total asset turnover ratio or TATR
is sales divided by average total assets.

109
00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:29.540
What we can do is solve for
forecasted total assets in a period.

110
00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:33.360
As two times forecasted sales
divided by turnover ratio.

111
00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.503
Minus total assets of the prior period.

112
00:06:39.723 --> 00:06:42.690
>> I am a certified genius for my age.

113
00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:45.060
But you really lost me
with this TATR stuff!

114
00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:50.150
>> So one of the most difficult things
about putting together an online course,

115
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:53.700
well other than not being able to
make eye contact with your students,

116
00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:59.000
is that you all have such variation in
backgrounds and experiences, in terms of

117
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:05.020
courses that you've taken in the past and
in terms of your affinity for mathematics.

118
00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:08.850
So I'm trying to run a middle course here,
where I will provide all these formulas.

119
00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:12.250
So if you love mathematics you
can get into the formulas but

120
00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:15.070
if you're somebody who doesn't like math,
no problem.

121
00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:18.190
Just ignore the formulas and
the technical stuff here and

122
00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:22.080
just trust that everything is programmed
in the spreadsheet correctly.

123
00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:25.484
So as long as you don't make
any changes to the formulas

124
00:07:25.484 --> 00:07:28.666
in the spreadsheet everything
will work out fine.

125
00:07:28.666 --> 00:07:33.880
Next, we multiply the forecasted total
assets at the end of the year times

126
00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:39.196
the forecasted common size ratio for
every asset and liability line item.

127
00:07:39.196 --> 00:07:43.984
For example, if we wanted to forecast
inventory, we would take the forecasted

128
00:07:43.984 --> 00:07:48.556
total assets at the end of the year times
the forecasted ratio of inventory to

129
00:07:48.556 --> 00:07:52.288
assets to get the forecasted
inventory at the end of the year.

130
00:07:52.288 --> 00:07:55.144
Once we forecast all the assets and
all the liabilities,

131
00:07:55.144 --> 00:07:57.478
then we can forecast stockholders' equity.

132
00:07:57.478 --> 00:08:01.062
And it's just gonna be the difference
between all the forecasted assets and

133
00:08:01.062 --> 00:08:04.702
the forecasted liabilities because
remember that balance sheet equation,

134
00:08:04.702 --> 00:08:07.740
assets have to equal liabilities
plus stockholders' equity.

135
00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:14.190
Now we have to do one technical refinement
that I've built into this spreadsheet.

136
00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:18.456
And we wanna smooth the forecasted total
assets to eliminate something called

137
00:08:18.456 --> 00:08:19.818
the saw-tooth effect.

138
00:08:19.818 --> 00:08:23.521
So what we're gonna do is forecast
unsmoothed total assets using

139
00:08:23.521 --> 00:08:24.740
the equation above.

140
00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:29.210
Then calculate the projected
average growth rate in assets

141
00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:31.080
over the horizon we're forecasting.

142
00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:37.318
And use that average growth rate to
project a smoothed asset growth series,

143
00:08:37.318 --> 00:08:40.460
so that we don't have
the saw-tooth effect.

144
00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:47.330
>> You are probably expecting me to ask,
do we have to forecast par value?

145
00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:48.700
But I am not.

146
00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:51.430
I would rather see an example
of this saw-tooth effect.

147
00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:55.790
>> That's an excellent idea,
why don't we spend about

148
00:08:55.790 --> 00:09:00.340
two minutes going through an example
of how the saw-tooth effect works?

149
00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:04.328
And then we'll get to
the Woof Junction spreadsheet.

150
00:09:04.328 --> 00:09:08.532
Let me give you a quick example of
how this saw-tooth effect works,

151
00:09:08.532 --> 00:09:10.170
and how we can correct it.

152
00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:14.990
So let's forecast the company
having 100 in sales every year.

153
00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:19.600
And we'll forecast that their total
asset turnover ratio is 2 every year.

154
00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:22.220
So we can use sales and

155
00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:26.200
total asset turnover ratio to
calculate average total assets.

156
00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.980
Cuz the total asset turnover
ratio is sales over total assets.

157
00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:33.850
So we have 2 equals 100 divided by x,
x is 50.

158
00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:38.240
So if we know that average
total assets were 50 and

159
00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:40.310
the total assets at
the beginning of the year,

160
00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:44.470
the previous ending total assets was 40,
then what we can do is we can take 2

161
00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:48.710
times the average minus the previous to
figure out ending total assets of 60.

162
00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:53.060
Or the other way to look at it is sixty is
the number where when we take the average,

163
00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:54.230
we end up with a value of fifty.

164
00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:59.380
In year two average, total assets
is still expected to be fifty.

165
00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:03.820
But now that's going to bring us back
down to forty to get that average, and

166
00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:06.260
as you can see it's gonna saw-tooth.

167
00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.880
It's gonna bounce up and
down like the teeth on a saw

168
00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:12.260
every year because of the way
we're doing the forecasting.

169
00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:18.010
If we have high forecasted sales
growth it gets even worse.

170
00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:22.620
We see a bigger up and
down in this saw-tooth pattern.

171
00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:25.940
So the way we're gonna correct it is we're
gonna try to figure out what's the growth

172
00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:30.490
rate every year that gets us
from 40 to 150 over the 5 year

173
00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:32.620
forecast horizon period.

174
00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:37.437
And we can calculate that by
taking 150 divided by 40 and

175
00:10:37.437 --> 00:10:43.584
then raising that to the 1/5 power to
get a compound growth rate of 1.3.

176
00:10:43.584 --> 00:10:46.692
Which means that basically,
if you start at 40 and

177
00:10:46.692 --> 00:10:52.200
you grow assets by 30% every year,
they'll get to 150 after five years.

178
00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:56.560
So then what we'll do when we forecast
total assets is we'll start with 40, and

179
00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:01.300
then we'll make it grow each year by 1.3.

180
00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:06.058
And so what this'll do is it'll grow
very smoothly from 40 up to 150,

181
00:11:06.058 --> 00:11:09.318
as opposed to exhibiting
this saw-tooth effect.

182
00:11:11.818 --> 00:11:15.550
So now let's try to apply
this to Woof Junction.

183
00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:19.280
So there's a tab in the spreadsheet
called Assumptions.

184
00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:23.637
And what I've got here are just some
basic assumptions to generate financial

185
00:11:23.637 --> 00:11:27.468
statements into the future,
the pro forma financial statements.

186
00:11:27.468 --> 00:11:30.874
What you can do on your own is you can
change any of these assumptions and

187
00:11:30.874 --> 00:11:33.550
see how the statements will change.

188
00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:34.800
So starting with sales growth,

189
00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:38.840
I just forecasted five years of
their historical average growth.

190
00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:42.280
Then I had a drop to five percent,
which is the industry average.

191
00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:46.870
You could put any kind of pattern in here
you want, or thought was appropriate.

192
00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:50.340
But once you forecast sales,
then you can use the historical

193
00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:54.140
averages from the common size
to forecast all the line items.

194
00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:58.308
Then you forecast total asset turnover.

195
00:11:58.308 --> 00:12:02.040
And again, I just took the historical
average as a starting point.

196
00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:06.180
Then we're gonna go down here
to the saw-tooth calculation.

197
00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:07.485
So what this will do for

198
00:12:07.485 --> 00:12:12.168
you is it will calculate the total assets
using the total assets turnover ratio.

199
00:12:12.168 --> 00:12:16.440
You get a little bit of saw-toothing
going on, or at least uneven growth.

200
00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:19.980
Then we figure out what's
the growth rate over this horizon,

201
00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:22.210
what's the growth rate over this horizon.

202
00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:28.680
Apply that to total assets to get
a much smoother growth in total assets.

203
00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:32.978
Once we get a smoother growth then what
I take is the historical average of

204
00:12:32.978 --> 00:12:34.528
the common size ratios for

205
00:12:34.528 --> 00:12:37.918
the balance sheet to forecast
out each of the line items.

206
00:12:37.918 --> 00:12:40.250
And so it'll look like this.

207
00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:43.790
Where every line item in the balance
sheet is the assumption for

208
00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:49.120
the cash to total assets ratio times the
total assets I forecasted during the year.

209
00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:53.615
The total assets all come from the
saw-tooth calculation and then we forecast

210
00:12:53.615 --> 00:12:57.906
an income statement where we start with
sales growth and then each line item

211
00:12:57.906 --> 00:13:02.358
is the forecasted ratio of the line item
to sales times whatever the sales is.

212
00:13:02.358 --> 00:13:05.866
Once you get the balance sheet income
statement, you can go through and

213
00:13:05.866 --> 00:13:07.278
take a look at the formulas.

214
00:13:07.278 --> 00:13:12.978
But it basically allows you to put
together a statement of cash flows.

215
00:13:12.978 --> 00:13:14.810
And also, ratios.

216
00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:17.960
So you can go look at these
ratios into the future,

217
00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:21.540
to see if your pro forma
financial statements makes sense.

218
00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:23.410
So again, this is just a base case.

219
00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:26.970
What you can do on your own is change
anything in the assumptions tab,

220
00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:30.560
and it will recalculate everything
automatically in the spreadsheet.

221
00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:35.700
There are a couple other refinements
you can do in forecasting.

222
00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:39.837
One is to try to decompose the net
increase and property plan and

223
00:13:39.837 --> 00:13:43.037
equipment into how much is
purchases of new PP and

224
00:13:43.037 --> 00:13:47.888
E verses stuff that's retired either
because it's sold or it wears out.

225
00:13:47.888 --> 00:13:51.777
And also you can decompose the change
in stockholder's equity and

226
00:13:51.777 --> 00:13:56.368
how much is net income verses dividends
and net share repurchases, and wait.

227
00:13:56.368 --> 00:13:58.448
Is that snoring that I hear?

228
00:14:02.308 --> 00:14:05.728
Okay, okay, I get the point,
enough technical details.

229
00:14:05.728 --> 00:14:10.485
These probably are more than you really
need to know but if you are interested,

230
00:14:10.485 --> 00:14:13.168
you can go through
the details on the slide.

231
00:14:13.168 --> 00:14:16.388
And then more importantly,
bring up the spreadsheet and

232
00:14:16.388 --> 00:14:19.880
I have all the calculations
on the assumptions tab.

233
00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:22.890
Which shows you how to do
these additional refinements.

234
00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:27.660
That wraps up our brief
look at forecasting.

235
00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:30.710
Obviously there's a lot more that
I could have done with this.

236
00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:33.000
But we've hit all the basics.

237
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.930
And now I think the key thing is for you
to get comfortable using that spreadsheet.

238
00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:41.156
So I thought about shooting more video
where I played around with some of

239
00:14:41.156 --> 00:14:44.385
the assumptions and showed you how
the financial statements change and

240
00:14:44.385 --> 00:14:45.318
the ratios change.

241
00:14:45.318 --> 00:14:47.885
But it's probably better
learning experience for

242
00:14:47.885 --> 00:14:50.630
you to do it yourself
than to watch me do it.

243
00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:53.940
So I strongly encourage you to get
out the Woof Junction spreadsheet.

244
00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:57.443
Changed some of the assumptions
individually and take a look at

245
00:14:57.443 --> 00:15:01.948
how it changes the forecasted financial
statements and the forecasted ratios.

246
00:15:01.948 --> 00:15:06.035
After you're done playing around with
all the assumptions, come back here and

247
00:15:06.035 --> 00:15:07.320
I'll see you next time.

248
00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:11.028
>> See you next video.
