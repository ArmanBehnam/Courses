00:00:03.663 --> 00:00:04.400
Hello.

2
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.550
I'm Professor Brian Bushee.

3
00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:06.630
Welcome back.

4
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.980
In this video we're gonna do a quick
review of the three financial statements.

5
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.690
This video is optional.

6
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.270
If you've just taken a financial
accounting course or

7
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:18.740
you do financial accounting for a living,
you don't need to watch this video.

8
00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.200
And if you've never seen
financial accounting before,

9
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.500
you don't need to watch this video either.

10
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.420
You need to go probably go take
a financial accounting course first before

11
00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.010
you take this course.

12
00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.260
But, if you know financial accounting but
it's been awhile, you wanna review

13
00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.950
the terminology, brush up on your
knowledge, then this is the video for you.

14
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:35.620
Let's get started.

15
00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.910
Let's start with a quick overview of
the required financial statements.

16
00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.492
We'll talk about each one in
a little more detail in a second.

17
00:00:44.492 --> 00:00:48.260
First, we have the balance sheet, which
is the statement of financial position.

18
00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.920
Which means it lists all of
the company's resources and

19
00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.780
obligations on a specific date.

20
00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.190
Here's where we can see assets equals
liabilities plus stockholder's equity.

21
00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.860
This is the equation that governs
everything in accounting, and

22
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.220
it must always be in balance.

23
00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.720
Then, we get an income statement
which shows the results of

24
00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.900
operations over a period of time.

25
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.820
By over a period of time I mean
between two balance sheets.

26
00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.210
So, maybe over a quarter, or over a year,
using something called accrual accounting

27
00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.630
which is where recognition is tied to
business activities, not to cash flows.

28
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.050
And this is where we can see net income,
also known as earnings, or

29
00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.220
net profit,
which equals revenues minus expenses.

30
00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:35.010
And the third major statement we're gonna
use is the statement of cash flows.

31
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.210
This shows all these sources and
uses of cash over a period of time

32
00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.785
split up into operating,
investing and financing activities.

33
00:01:42.785 --> 00:01:50.700
>> Mr. Professor, I learned a ton
of accounting in Montessori school.

34
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.650
But shouldn't you explain this
stuff more for those who didn't?

35
00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.870
>> Just to reiterate
what I said in the intro,

36
00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:01.650
the goal of this course is not to
teach you financial accounting.

37
00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.490
There are other courses
out there that do that.

38
00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.430
Rather, the goal of this course is to
teach you to do interesting analytics

39
00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:11.680
with your knowledge of
financial accounting.

40
00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.670
So, if you are really lost at this point,
you probably want to go take an intro to

41
00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.650
financial accounting first,
then come back and take this course.

42
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:20.497
I'll still be here.

43
00:02:22.854 --> 00:02:26.090
Now, let's review the balance
sheet in more detail.

44
00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.130
So, we have assets, which are resources
owned by the business that are expected to

45
00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.350
provide future economic benefits.

46
00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.420
By that we mean they'll either provide
cash coming in in the future, or

47
00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.360
they'll save the company from
having to spend cash in the future.

48
00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.970
Liabilities are claims on assets by
creditors who are non-owners that

49
00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.219
represents some obligation to make future
payment of cash, goods, or services.

50
00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.980
And stockholders equity is the claim on
the assets by the owners of the business.

51
00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.006
So, we have the balance sheet equation
that assets equal liabilities plus

52
00:02:59.006 --> 00:03:02.160
stockholders equity,
which means that your resources,

53
00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.160
assets, equal claims on those
resources by outsiders, creditors.

54
00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.720
And then, claims by the owners,
stockholders equity.

55
00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.720
Stockholders equity is made
up of a couple components.

56
00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.420
First of all, there's contributed capital.

57
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.100
This is the common stock, or
additional paying capital,

58
00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.770
that arises when the company
sells shares of stock.

59
00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.659
And retained earnings, which arise when
the company operates the business.

60
00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.910
Retained earnings are increased by
revenues, which is what you get

61
00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.690
when the company delivers goods or
services to its customers.

62
00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.480
They're decreased by expenses, which are
the costs of generating those revenues.

63
00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.679
Also, decreased by dividends,

64
00:03:41.679 --> 00:03:46.245
which are decisions to pay out either
cash or stock to shareholders.

65
00:03:48.682 --> 00:03:52.960
>> [FOREIGN] Are you going to talk
about Par Value again in this course?

66
00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.000
>> If you've taken my Intro to
Financial Accounting course,

67
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.700
you know there's this guy who always
likes to ask me about Par Value.

68
00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.350
Looks like he's back again.

69
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:06.620
But have no fear, I will not be talking
about Par Value at all in this course.

70
00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.160
Let's take a quick look at
the balance sheet for a real company.

71
00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.360
This is the 3M company, and this is
the asset side of their balance sheet.

72
00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:21.100
Starts with cash plus short-term

73
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:26.470
marketable securities,
which should pay off within the next year.

74
00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.070
Then, there's accounts receivable.

75
00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.110
This is the amount owed by customers.

76
00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.150
So, we've recorded sales in the past, and

77
00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.540
this is how much cash we're gonna
collect from them in the future.

78
00:04:35.658 --> 00:04:38.580
Inventories are the cost of all
the goods that are available for

79
00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.070
sale split up into the cost
of goods that are finished,

80
00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:46.360
finished goods, the cost of goods that
are in the process of being produced,

81
00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.110
work in process, and the cost of
all our raw materials and supplies.

82
00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.840
Other current assets,
these are operating costs paid in advance.

83
00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.700
So, maybe you paid rent or insurance
in advance of using up the rent, or

84
00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.600
using up the insurance.

85
00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.740
So, we have this other current
asset to represent that.

86
00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.070
Then, we have non current assets.

87
00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:08.390
These are assets beyond one year.

88
00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:10.890
So, marketable securities and investments.

89
00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:11.910
Property plant and equipment.

90
00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:14.110
We show the original cost.

91
00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.510
Then, the accumulated depreciation, which
is how much of that original cost has been

92
00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.720
recognized in income as an expense.

93
00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:21.950
And we'll talk about that in a little bit.

94
00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:25.080
Then, we have goodwill and
intangible assets.

95
00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.560
So, goodwill is the premium that
3M is paid in acquisitions.

96
00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:34.050
And in tangible assets are contractual
rights like patents or trademarks.

97
00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:38.570
Here's the liability and

98
00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:41.970
stockholders equity side of
the 3M company balance sheet.

99
00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:43.290
Starts with current liabilities.

100
00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:48.900
These are obligations due within the next
year starting with short term debt.

101
00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.650
Then, accounts payable.

102
00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:54.470
This is amount owed to suppliers
on purchases that we've made.

103
00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:57.150
So, we've received stuff
from suppliers in the past,

104
00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:58.800
now we owe this cash in the future.

105
00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.710
Then, there's a bunch of other payables,
or what are called accruals.

106
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:06.680
These are operating costs like salaries or

107
00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.620
income taxes that we've
recognized an expense.

108
00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.750
And we owe those people
the money in the future.

109
00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:16.000
Below current liabilities,
we have long term debt.

110
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.050
So, debt that's due beyond a year.

111
00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:21.605
And then, longer term pension benefits and
other long term liabilities.

112
00:06:21.605 --> 00:06:23.240
Stockholders equity.

113
00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.070
We have common stock and paid in capital.

114
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:29.498
That's what shows up when we
issue stock to our investors.

115
00:06:29.498 --> 00:06:34.074
Retained earnings is the sum of all
the prior net income that 3M has

116
00:06:34.074 --> 00:06:37.356
earned minus any dividends
that they paid out.

117
00:06:37.356 --> 00:06:39.597
The rest of the stuff we're
not going to talk about.

118
00:06:39.597 --> 00:06:42.209
Treasury stock is when they
repurchase their own stock.

119
00:06:42.209 --> 00:06:45.200
And then, I'm definitely not gonna talk
about accumulated other comprehensive

120
00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:46.030
income at this point.

121
00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:47.771
But that's what the balance
sheet looks like.

122
00:06:47.771 --> 00:06:51.760
And as you notice,
the assets equal liabilities and equity.

123
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:56.640
Next, let's review the income statement.

124
00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:58.410
So, on the income statement
we'll see revenues,

125
00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:02.620
which are increases in stockholders
equity from providing goods and services.

126
00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:06.247
These will also be called sales or
credits or gains.

127
00:07:08.846 --> 00:07:10.840
>> Stockholders equity?

128
00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:12.660
What are you talking about?

129
00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:15.230
Why isn't a revenue an increase in cash?

130
00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:17.580
>> Good question.

131
00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:20.310
This is a pretty fundamental
point of financial accounting.

132
00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:22.810
So, let's take a little bit to review it.

133
00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:27.083
Revenue is recognized when companies
deliver the goods to customers,

134
00:07:27.083 --> 00:07:29.586
not necessarily when they get paid cash.

135
00:07:29.586 --> 00:07:31.737
So, the company delivers the goods, but

136
00:07:31.737 --> 00:07:34.820
then gives the customer an invoice
to get paid in 30 days.

137
00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:39.483
We create an accounts receivable between
the time we recognize the revenue and

138
00:07:39.483 --> 00:07:41.043
when we collect the cash.

139
00:07:41.043 --> 00:07:44.757
Or sometimes companies will receive
cash before delivering the goods.

140
00:07:44.757 --> 00:07:45.987
So they get a deposit.

141
00:07:45.987 --> 00:07:50.054
So, they'll create a liability called
unearned revenue between the time they

142
00:07:50.054 --> 00:07:52.130
receive the cash and deliver the goods.

143
00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:57.480
But in both cases the revenue will be
recognized when the goods are delivered,

144
00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:00.020
not when cash is gonna be received.

145
00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:03.640
And that's a fundamental point for accrual
accounting, is that we recognize revenues

146
00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:08.010
and expenses based on business activities,
not based on cash flow.

147
00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:10.790
Which is why it's an increase
in stockholder's equity and

148
00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:12.050
not necessarily an increase in cash.

149
00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:17.170
Next, we have expenses,
which are decreases in stockholders

150
00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:20.200
equity that incurred in the process
of generating revenues.

151
00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:23.170
These are also called provisions or
charges or losses.

152
00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:27.340
And then, net income,
which is also known as earnings or

153
00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:30.790
net profit,
which is these revenues minus expenses.

154
00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:34.690
Does not equal the change in cash because
we're gonna recognize revenues and

155
00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:39.930
expenses based on business activities, not
based on cash coming in or cash going out.

156
00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:44.160
Here's the Income Statement for
3M company.

157
00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:46.090
Starts at the top with net sales.

158
00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:50.100
So, that's the revenue which is the value
of goods delivered to customers during

159
00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:51.779
the period using the selling price.

160
00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:56.090
Cost of sales,
also known as cost of goods sold.

161
00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:59.790
That's the cost of goods that were
delivered to customers during the period

162
00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:03.710
using the historical cost
of manufacturing the goods.

163
00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:05.800
Selling general and
administrative expenses.

164
00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:09.060
These are all the operating
expenses incurred the period.

165
00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:11.700
So things like the cost of
your sales force, marketing,

166
00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:14.049
top management, admin, and so forth.

167
00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:16.585
Research and development expenses.

168
00:09:16.585 --> 00:09:17.740
Self-explanatory.

169
00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:20.780
The cost of research and
development activity during the period.

170
00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:25.260
And then, that gives us operating income,
which you can think of as

171
00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:29.030
the profitability from
the core business of 3M.

172
00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:33.970
Below that, we include interest expense
and interest income during the period.

173
00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:37.590
The provision or expense for income taxes.

174
00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:41.160
And then, at the bottom,
the net income attributable to 3M.

175
00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.380
You can ignore
the non-controlling interest.

176
00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:45.830
It's not something we're gonna talk about.

177
00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:50.160
Instead, we're gonna focus on this bottom
line net income attributable to 3M.

178
00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:54.430
Finally, we have
the statement of cash flow,

179
00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:59.410
which is gonna summarize all of the cash
transactions during the period split

180
00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:03.070
up into operating activities which are
transactions related to providing goods or

181
00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:06.810
services and
other normal business activities.

182
00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:10.096
Investing activities, which
are transactions related to a acquiring or

183
00:10:10.096 --> 00:10:13.070
disposing of long-lived assets
like property plant equipment.

184
00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:17.360
And financing activities, which
are transactions related to owners or

185
00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:18.700
creditors.

186
00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:22.000
So, here's the cash flow statement for
the 3M Company.

187
00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.900
I'm not gonna go through the whole thing
because if you've taken prior courses,

188
00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:29.970
you know this is really hard and
complicated to put together.

189
00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:31.220
The numbers that we're gonna need for

190
00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:35.680
this course are the net cash
provided by operating activities.

191
00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:37.772
So, again,
that's cash coming in from customers,

192
00:10:37.772 --> 00:10:41.730
cash we're paying out to suppliers,
employees, or other vendors.

193
00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:45.580
Cash used in investing activities.

194
00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:49.070
This is the cash spent on capital
expenditures, or acquiring other

195
00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:54.530
companies, or buying marketable
securities, less any disposals of those.

196
00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:57.810
And finally,
the cash used in financing activities.

197
00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:02.930
We get cash from financing activities
when we issue stock or we borrow money.

198
00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:06.570
We pay out cash for financing
activities when we pay back debt,

199
00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:10.700
when we buy back our stock, or
when we pay dividends to shareholders.

200
00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:15.706
So, the total cash changed during the year
is split up into these three categories.

201
00:11:18.318 --> 00:11:22.220
That wraps up our quick review
of the financial statements.

202
00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:26.050
Now that we know all the wonderful
information that are in those financials,

203
00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:29.320
we can start doing some really
interesting stuff with it.

204
00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:30.020
I'll see you next time.

205
00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:33.412
>> See you next video.
