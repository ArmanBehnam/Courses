00:00:03.037 --> 00:00:06.180
Well, I'm Professor Brian Bushee,
welcome back.

2
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.780
In this video, we're gonna start out
ration analysis of wolf junction

3
00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.870
with something called the DuPont Analysis.

4
00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:16.150
The DuPont Analysis is a common method for

5
00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:21.410
trying to trying to identify a company's
competitive advantages or disadvantages.

6
00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.790
The analysis will break down this
ratio called return on equity or ROE,

7
00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:31.030
which is a measure of how much return the
company generates for its shareholders.

8
00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:34.900
It'll break it down into three
components: profitability,

9
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.190
the efficiency with which managers
are running the company, and leverage,

10
00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.640
or how much debt the company has taken on.

11
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.450
By breaking our way down
into those three components,

12
00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.090
we can see where a company is doing
better, or not as good as its competition.

13
00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:51.100
Let's get started.

14
00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.310
The analysis framework that
we will be using is called

15
00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.680
the DuPont Ratio Analysis Framework.

16
00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.770
>> Eh, is this named after
Eleuthere Irenee du Pont?

17
00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.231
>> Well the DuPont formula's named
after the DuPont Chemical Company,

18
00:01:08.231 --> 00:01:10.502
where it was developed
in the 19th Century.

19
00:01:10.502 --> 00:01:15.620
And I guess the DuPont Chemical Company is
named after the guy you mentioned before.

20
00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.270
So, indirectly it is named after that guy.

21
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.880
But since you interrupted me,

22
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.800
let me try to preempt a question that may
come up as we go through these slides.

23
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.350
So in these ratios, were gonna compare
income statement numbers like net income

24
00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.580
to balance sheet number like assets.

25
00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.930
The probably run into is,
net income happened over an entire year

26
00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.410
where is a balance sheet number
like asset is at a point in time.

27
00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.050
So what you'll notice is were gonna
take averages of the beginning and

28
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.170
ending balances of all of
the balance sheet accounts

29
00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.450
to approximate the level during the year.

30
00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.120
So you'll see an income statement number
for the period, divided by the average of

31
00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.370
the balance sheet number using the balance
at the beginning and ending of the period.

32
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.920
The framework starts with
the ratio Return on Equity or ROE.

33
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.140
This is defined as net income,
divided by average shareholders equity.

34
00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.860
And it tells us how much return the
company generates for it's shareholders.

35
00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.460
In other words for
every dollar of shareholder investment.

36
00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.270
How much return or net income
do the management team generate?

37
00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.830
There's two drivers of ROE.

38
00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.830
Return on Assets or ROA and
Financial Leverage.

39
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.851
Return on Assets is defined
as Net Income / Avg.

40
00:02:30.851 --> 00:02:32.480
Total Assets.

41
00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.038
It's answering the question how
effectively do the managers use

42
00:02:36.038 --> 00:02:38.697
their resources or
assets to generate profits.

43
00:02:38.697 --> 00:02:41.500
So it's a measure of
operating performance.

44
00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.060
For each dollar of assets, how much
net income does the company generate?

45
00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.620
The other component is Financial Leverage.

46
00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:49.340
Which is Avg.

47
00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:50.499
Total Assets / Avg.

48
00:02:50.499 --> 00:02:52.230
Shareholders Equity.

49
00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.920
And this tells us how much
debt does the company

50
00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.120
use to try to increase its total assets.

51
00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.300
So for
every dollar of shareholder investment,

52
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.920
shareholders equity,
how many assets are they able to buy?

53
00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.256
You're able to buy more than
a dollar assets if you take on debt.

54
00:03:08.256 --> 00:03:11.223
We're really gonna focus
on the return on assets,

55
00:03:11.223 --> 00:03:15.740
cuz we wanna understand the operating
performance of the company.

56
00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.760
And there's two drivers of ROA.

57
00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.731
There's Return on Sales or
ROS, and Asset Turnover.

58
00:03:21.731 --> 00:03:25.610
Return on Sales is
a measure of Profitability.

59
00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.550
It's defined as Net Income / Sales.

60
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:31.710
It answers the question of how
much profit does the company earn

61
00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:33.040
on each dollar of sales.

62
00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.300
Asset Turnover is a measure of Efficiency.

63
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.739
It's Sales / Avg.

64
00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:40.180
Total Assets.

65
00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.320
It's answering the question how much
sales does the company generate?

66
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.010
Using it's available assets, so for

67
00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.600
every dollar of assets,
how much sales can it generate.

68
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.970
Now if we bring back down Leverage,

69
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:57.040
we can see the DuPont innovation was
to notice that ROE, return on equity

70
00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.390
is equal to Net Income / Sales
x Sales/Assets x Assets/Equity.

71
00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:07.150
In other words ROE equals
Profitability x Efficiency x Leverage.

72
00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.810
This decomposition will let us take a look
at whether a company's advantages or

73
00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.820
disadvantages in their ROE is
driven by their Profitability,

74
00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.050
their Efficiency, or their Leverage.

75
00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:23.920
>> My sister is a long-short
hedge fund guru and

76
00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.800
she says you always have to
use de-levered net income.

77
00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.950
>> Your sister is exactly right.

78
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.160
If we use regular netting
com in return assets and

79
00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.400
return on sales, it will be effective
by a company's financing decisions.

80
00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.820
So we do have to calculate some
called de-levered netting com, and

81
00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.590
then use that in place of
netting com in ROA and ROS.

82
00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:45.889
So let me show you how that works.

83
00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.330
So, let's look at how Leverage
affects return on assets.

84
00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.500
Ideally, return on assets would
measure operating performance

85
00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.750
independent of any of
the company's financing decisions.

86
00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:03.100
The problem is that the numerator of ROA,
Net income, includes interest expense.

87
00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.280
Which means that the more
leverage a company took on,

88
00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.420
the higher its interest expense would be.

89
00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:10.530
And the lower its net income.

90
00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:15.380
So to remove all the financing effects
from ROA we have to de-lever Net income.

91
00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:19.900
So now ROA is going to be de-levered net
income divided by average assets where

92
00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:24.775
de-levered net income is defined as net
income-plus after tax interest expense.

93
00:05:24.775 --> 00:05:27.188
So after taxed Interest Expense,

94
00:05:27.188 --> 00:05:31.690
it's gonna be Interest Expense
x 1- the tax rate, which is t.

95
00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:33.280
Let me show you a quick example.

96
00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.160
We have two companies, one that has
no debt, one that has some debt.

97
00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.043
They have identical Pretax,
pre-interest income of 300.

98
00:05:40.043 --> 00:05:42.983
The company with some debt
has Interest Expense,

99
00:05:42.983 --> 00:05:45.860
whereas the no debt company doesn't.

100
00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:49.620
Which means the some debt
company has lower pretax income.

101
00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.840
We multiply that times the tax rate, and

102
00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:56.860
we see that the some debt company has
lower net income than the no debt company.

103
00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.060
But then if we add back
after-tax interest expense,

104
00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:04.660
which would be 50 (1-.35),

105
00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:09.800
voila, we get identical de-levered
net income between the two companies.

106
00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:14.560
So de-levered net income is not
affected by borrowing decisions.

107
00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:20.370
So our corrected DuPont Ratio Analysis
Framework, we're gonna use de-levered

108
00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:24.829
net income in ROA and we're gonna use
de-levered net income in Return on Sales.

109
00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.060
>> This is so boring.

110
00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:32.570
Can you show us some
actual numbers already?

111
00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:34.550
>> Okay, okay, thanks for
pushing me along.

112
00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:38.840
What you should do right now, is go
find the spreadsheet for Wolf Junction,

113
00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:42.430
because we're gonna go through the ratios
for Wolf Junction the rest of the video.

114
00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:48.100
So if you open up
the Woof Junction spreadsheet,

115
00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:50.690
you'll see a tab called Ratios.

116
00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:55.970
And at the top, we have the ratios for
the Dupont analysis.

117
00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:58.390
And what I encourage you to do
on your own, after this video,

118
00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:02.400
is look at the different formulas so
you can see how it pulls in data

119
00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:05.860
from the original financial
statements in the first half.

120
00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:07.880
So anyway, we start with Return on Equity.

121
00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:10.140
And we can see there's an upward trend and

122
00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:12.668
very steep upward trend
in Return on Equity.

123
00:07:12.668 --> 00:07:18.280
So this 40% percent means that for
every dollar of investment that Woof has

124
00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:23.350
gotten from their shareholders, they're
returning about 40 cents of net income.

125
00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:27.110
I'll also give you the average over
the four years which we'll use later on.

126
00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:31.890
So what explains this upward
trend in Return on Equity?

127
00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:35.890
Well we can look at the two drivers
Return on Assets and Financial Leverage.

128
00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:40.220
Now, I've thrown in a third factor,
a Correction Factor, cuz remember for

129
00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:43.350
Return on Assets,
we now use De-levered Net Income.

130
00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:45.800
So once you put in De-levered Net Income,

131
00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.940
ROE is no longer equal
to ROA times leverage.

132
00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:51.210
You also have to add a Correction Factor.

133
00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:54.160
Which is the ratio of net income
to De-levered Net Income.

134
00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:55.550
This is not important,

135
00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:59.540
we're not going to do anything with this,
I just put it in for completeness.

136
00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:02.350
Instead, we're gonna focus
on Return on Assets.

137
00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:07.290
Strong upward trend in operating
performance, so if you look at this 24%,

138
00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:13.220
for every dollar of assets, Woof now
generates about 24 cents in profit.

139
00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:15.440
In terms of De-levered Net Income.

140
00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:18.860
If you look at Financial Leverage,
it's been fairly steady, so

141
00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:24.010
this 1.68 means that for every dollar
of investment from shareholders,

142
00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:30.520
Woof buys about $1.68 of assets, so
they're getting about 0.68 of debt.

143
00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:33.550
So we can say that what's been
driving their upward trend and

144
00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:37.000
return in equity is an upward trend
in their operating performance.

145
00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:41.830
So now we can look at the two
drivers of operating performance.

146
00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:45.680
Return on Sales or Profitability and
asset turnover efficiency.

147
00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:50.738
So what we see again a nice
upward trend and Return on Sales.

148
00:08:50.738 --> 00:08:55.240
This 9.2% means that for

149
00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:59.950
every dollar of sales,
Woof earns about nine cents of profit.

150
00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:04.300
When we look at Asset turnover,
it's sort of an up and down.

151
00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:05.748
There is no clear trend.

152
00:09:05.748 --> 00:09:10.486
What this 2.62 represents is for
every dollar of assets,

153
00:09:10.486 --> 00:09:13.866
Woof generates about $2.60 of sales.

154
00:09:13.866 --> 00:09:16.343
But there hasn't been
a real trend in this, so

155
00:09:16.343 --> 00:09:20.344
we can say that the whole reason for
Woof's improvement in return on equity

156
00:09:20.344 --> 00:09:24.620
has been driven by their operating
performance, return on assets.

157
00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:28.970
And their improve on operating performance
is almost exclusively driven by their

158
00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:31.169
profitability or Return on Sales.

159
00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:36.010
>> Maybe every company had a good year.

160
00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:38.560
Shouldn't we compare
them to other companies?

161
00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:40.020
>> Makes sense.

162
00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:42.080
But what other companies should we use?

163
00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:44.180
>> Excellent point.

164
00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:48.490
So the ratios have shown us that
Woof Junctions had a great improvement in

165
00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:49.660
performance.

166
00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:53.700
But what we don't know is whether
Woof Junction management has done

167
00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:56.110
something special to
trigger that performance.

168
00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:58.980
Or whether the whole industry
is performing better and

169
00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:03.195
maybe Woof is not even doing as well as
the rest of the industry over this period.

170
00:10:03.195 --> 00:10:06.875
So we need to find some competitors
to compare Woof Junction to.

171
00:10:06.875 --> 00:10:08.205
So let's spend about a minute or

172
00:10:08.205 --> 00:10:12.405
so to talk about some ways that
you can find good competitors so

173
00:10:12.405 --> 00:10:15.465
that you can compare other company's
to the company you're interested in.

174
00:10:16.755 --> 00:10:21.440
So let's briefly talk about different
ways you could find comparison firms.

175
00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:25.056
So every company has some kinda've
standard classification code for

176
00:10:25.056 --> 00:10:26.533
what industry they're in.

177
00:10:26.533 --> 00:10:29.320
One method are called SIC Codes.

178
00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:31.876
Another method is called NAICS Code.

179
00:10:31.876 --> 00:10:35.245
And you can click on these links and
find out what the codes are and

180
00:10:35.245 --> 00:10:37.742
then once you've find out a code for
a company,

181
00:10:37.742 --> 00:10:40.317
you can find other companies
with the same code.

182
00:10:40.317 --> 00:10:44.012
Another approach is to look
at our security analyst and

183
00:10:44.012 --> 00:10:46.920
data services use as comparisons.

184
00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:49.100
So, if you pick up
a security analyst report,

185
00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:51.630
they'll often mention
the company's competitors.

186
00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:53.880
If you go to Google Finance or
some of these other sites,

187
00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:56.600
they'll give you a list
of related companies.

188
00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:58.810
And then Reuters gives you industry and

189
00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:01.089
sector averages which you
could use as comparisons.

190
00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:06.950
In the end you wanna use your judgement on
whether companies are good competitors or

191
00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:11.520
not based on taking a look at their
business and their segments to make

192
00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:13.550
sure they're similar to the company
that you're looking at.

193
00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:19.550
So let's do a a comparison for
Woof Junction.

194
00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:23.990
In the spreadsheet, I have one of
their competitors, Ooh La Lab, and

195
00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:27.950
I also have the average for
the Specialty Pet Retail Group.

196
00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:33.990
So for Woof Junction,
we can see that their average ROE is

197
00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:38.760
higher than Ooh La Lab and higher
than the Specialty Pet Retail Group.

198
00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:42.720
And remember for Woof Junction
we said upward trends in ROE,

199
00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:45.820
also for ROA, and return on sales.

200
00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:51.040
But if we look at the competitor,
Ooh La Lab, there's not an upward trend.

201
00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:53.550
In fact,
it's going down the last three years.

202
00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:56.749
A similar thing for
the Specialty Pet Retail Group.

203
00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:02.010
We can look at Return on Assets or
operating performance.

204
00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:08.150
Woof is doing better than Ooh La Lab and
the industry group as a whole.

205
00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:10.710
Despite the fact that
they have lower leverage,

206
00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:14.160
their higher return on assets
gives them higher ROE.

207
00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:18.300
Then we can look at their Return on
Asset drivers, Return on Sales and

208
00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:19.830
Asset turnover.

209
00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:24.940
We find is that Woof has about the same
Return on Sales as Ooh La Lab.

210
00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:27.900
So how do they have more Return on Assets?

211
00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:32.450
Well, they have higher Asset turnover
at the same level of profitability.

212
00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:37.510
So Woof is able to generate more sales for
their assets than Ooh La Lab.

213
00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:40.870
Both companies do better
than the index as a whole.

214
00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:43.940
And again,
you don't see the same upward trends in

215
00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:46.790
profitability that you saw for Woof.

216
00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:51.650
So it looks like the secret
to Woof's success is upward

217
00:12:51.650 --> 00:12:57.200
trend in profitability that's
not mirrored by the industry.

218
00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:00.670
And they've been able to do that
at a higher level of turnover

219
00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:01.879
than their competitors.

220
00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:08.190
That wraps up our DuPont
analysis of Woof Junction.

221
00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:10.430
What we've seen is that they're large and

222
00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:14.080
growing advantage in return
on equity over Ooh La Lab and

223
00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:20.090
the industry has been driven by their
steady increases and profitability.

224
00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:23.180
And their consistently higher
level of asset turnover.

225
00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:27.440
In the next video, we're gonna dive
deeper into each of those ratios, and

226
00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:31.380
see if we can tie back to their
strategy to see what, specifically,

227
00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:35.050
they're doing that's giving them such
a big advantage over their competition.

228
00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:36.690
I'll see you next time.

229
00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:39.164
>> See you next video.
