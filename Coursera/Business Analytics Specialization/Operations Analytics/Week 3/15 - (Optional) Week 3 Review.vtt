00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.170
Welcome, this is the review session for

2
00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:04.610
week three of operations
in analytics course.

3
00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:07.208
As before, this review session
is completely optional,

4
00:00:07.208 --> 00:00:09.806
if you feel that the simulation
concepts are clear to you,

5
00:00:09.806 --> 00:00:12.578
you can skip this review and
move on to the practice problems.

6
00:00:12.578 --> 00:00:16.754
After that if you feel ready,
tackle week three's homework.

7
00:00:16.754 --> 00:00:20.784
However, if before trying the practice
problems, you would like to have

8
00:00:20.784 --> 00:00:25.220
an additional look at how a simulation can
be set up and run, then keep watching.

9
00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.170
In this review session, we will go
over another simulation example.

10
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.140
Here's the business context
we're going to model.

11
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.499
We're looking at the ESI,
a company that produces chemical solvent.

12
00:00:37.499 --> 00:00:42.452
The company has a contract that
requires it to deliver 35 tons

13
00:00:42.452 --> 00:00:47.510
of solvent at the price of
10,000 Euros per ton every day.

14
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:54.320
While the expected value of the solvent
produced each day is exactly 35 tons,

15
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.020
the actual production amount
is hard to control exactly,

16
00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.460
due to the nature of
the production process.

17
00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.900
And the actual amount of solvent produced
can be different from the expected value.

18
00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.900
The analysis of the past production output
shows that the actual daily production

19
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.570
output can be modeled as a normal random
variable with mean of 35 tons and

20
00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.369
the standard deviation of 7 tons.

21
00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:28.550
The cost to ESI to produce one
ton of solvent is 9,500 Euros.

22
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.560
If the actual production exceeds 35 tons,
the extra production above

23
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.460
35 tons must be salvaged
at a price of 9,000 Euros.

24
00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.856
If the production falls short of 35 tons,

25
00:01:42.856 --> 00:01:47.548
ESI is penalized at the amount of
2,000 Euros for each ton below 35.

26
00:01:47.548 --> 00:01:52.660
So here are the questions we would
like to answer in this problem.

27
00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:57.050
First, we will calculate the profit ESI
earns on a day when its production turns

28
00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.062
out to be 31 tons.

29
00:02:00.062 --> 00:02:04.920
Then, we'll repeat this calculation for
a day when the production is 37 tons.

30
00:02:07.138 --> 00:02:11.155
Answering these first two questions
will prepare us to write down

31
00:02:11.155 --> 00:02:14.630
an algebraic formula for
the daily profit V.

32
00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.050
As a function of the production output p.

33
00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.830
Finally, we will set up and
run a simulation for

34
00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.390
the daily profit value using 100
simulation runs and the seed 123

35
00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.069
to estimate the expected value and
the standard deviation of daily profits.

36
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.965
Okay, let's start by calculating
ESI's profit on a day when its

37
00:02:36.965 --> 00:02:38.969
production happens to be 31 tons.

38
00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:43.601
Since the production on that day is below
35 tons, the company will earn revenue by

39
00:02:43.601 --> 00:02:47.460
selling all of its production
at 10,000 Euros per ton.

40
00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.870
And will also incur production
costs of 9,500 Euros per ton.

41
00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:58.060
In addition, it will also incur a cost
of 2,000 Euros per ton below 35 tons.

42
00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.593
So on the revenue side,
ESI will earn 310,000 Eeuros.

43
00:03:02.593 --> 00:03:08.227
On the cost side,
it will incur the production

44
00:03:08.227 --> 00:03:12.132
cost of 294,500 Euros.

45
00:03:15.576 --> 00:03:24.162
It will also incur a penalty
cost of 8000 Euros on that day,

46
00:03:24.162 --> 00:03:29.184
so the profit will be 310000-

47
00:03:29.184 --> 00:03:35.503
294500- 8000, 7500 Euros.

48
00:03:35.503 --> 00:03:41.950
Now let's do the same calculation for
a day when ESI's production is 37 tons.

49
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.580
Since production on that
day is above 35 tons

50
00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.100
the company will earn revenue in two ways.

51
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.230
First it will sell 35 tons
at 10,000 Euros per ton.

52
00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.530
Second, it will sell the remaining
2 tons at a discount price

53
00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.580
of 9,000 euros per ton.

54
00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:03.850
It will incur a production
cost of 9500 Euros per ton.

55
00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.210
So let's count.

56
00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:10.442
The regular revenue on
that day will be 350,000,

57
00:04:10.442 --> 00:04:16.110
the discount revenue on that
day will be 180,00 Euros,

58
00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:21.560
the production cost will
amount to 351,500 Euros.

59
00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.162
So the total profit on that day

60
00:04:26.162 --> 00:04:30.780
will be 16,500 Euros.

61
00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.382
Now let's put together both cases,
with production

62
00:04:35.382 --> 00:04:40.403
being below versus at or
above 35 tons, using algebra.

63
00:04:40.403 --> 00:04:46.560
If P<35,
three components contribute to the profit.

64
00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.223
Now let's put both cases together,
with production

65
00:04:51.223 --> 00:04:56.312
being below versus at or
above 35 tons, using algebra.

66
00:04:56.312 --> 00:04:59.890
If P<35,
three components contribute to the profit.

67
00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:05.574
First the firm incurs
a production cost of 9500*P.

68
00:05:05.574 --> 00:05:10.180
Then there's a revenue of 10,000*P.

69
00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:15.467
Finally there's a penalty
cost of 2000*35-P.

70
00:05:15.467 --> 00:05:21.134
So putting these three
components together we get,

71
00:05:21.134 --> 00:05:27.836
10000*P-9500*P-2000*(35-P) and

72
00:05:27.836 --> 00:05:33.127
the final answer is 2500*P-70000.

73
00:05:33.127 --> 00:05:37.127
In the second case,
when the production P is at or

74
00:05:37.127 --> 00:05:42.260
above 35,
we also have three profit components.

75
00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.694
First we have a production cost of 9500*P.

76
00:05:45.694 --> 00:05:51.231
On the revenue side we have
regular revenue of 35*10000

77
00:05:51.231 --> 00:05:56.059
plus the discount revenue of 9000*(P-35).

78
00:05:56.059 --> 00:06:01.055
So the first 35 tons ESI
sells at 10000 Euros per ton.

79
00:06:01.055 --> 00:06:06.890
And everything above 35 it sells at
the discount price of 9000 Euros per ton.

80
00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:14.824
So putting these three
components together we get,

81
00:06:14.824 --> 00:06:22.310
100000*35 + 9000*P- 35- 9500*P.

82
00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:29.903
And the final answer is -500*P + 35,000.

83
00:06:29.903 --> 00:06:35.520
So we can combine both cases
using IF function in Excel.

84
00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:42.740
If P is less than 35,
then the first formula applies and

85
00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:46.730
if P is at or above 35,
then the second formula applies.

86
00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:51.650
The last question in this problem,
asks us to set up and run a simulation of

87
00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:57.148
the daily profit value using 100
simulation runs and the seed = 123.

88
00:06:57.148 --> 00:07:01.127
We have prepared an Excel
template Europa Solvent_0 that we

89
00:07:01.127 --> 00:07:04.962
will use to simulate the distribution
of the daily profit.

90
00:07:04.962 --> 00:07:09.050
Let's open this file and
set up and run our simulation.

91
00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:14.430
Let us set up a simulation of the daily
production and daily profit values for

92
00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:18.000
the ESI company using 100
simulation runs and the seed 123.

93
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.750
We will start with
the file Europa Solvent_0.

94
00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:27.120
This file contains the problem data and
is ready for the simulation set up.

95
00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:31.000
For convenience, we have also copied here
the formula from the PowerPoint slides

96
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.335
that calculates the daily profit value
V for any daily production value P.

97
00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:41.191
Okay, in order to prepare our simulation,

98
00:07:41.191 --> 00:07:45.790
let's first add headers to the sales D1,
E1, and F1.

99
00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:47.791
In D1 we enter Simulation Run.

100
00:07:53.051 --> 00:07:55.895
This header will indicate that below,
in the column D,

101
00:07:55.895 --> 00:07:58.629
we will count the instances
of our random variables.

102
00:08:00.611 --> 00:08:03.904
In E1, we will enter Daily Production.

103
00:08:10.895 --> 00:08:14.540
In tons.

104
00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:19.270
So in the column E we will be generating
random instances of the ESI's

105
00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:20.670
daily production values.

106
00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:29.174
Finally, in the cell F1 we
will enter profit in Euros.

107
00:08:41.749 --> 00:08:42.328
Okay.

108
00:08:55.799 --> 00:09:00.628
This column will contain the daily profit
calculated using the random instances

109
00:09:00.628 --> 00:09:02.909
of the data production from column E.

110
00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:07.545
This simulation will have
100 simulations runs,

111
00:09:07.545 --> 00:09:12.175
in other words we will generate 100 random
instances of daily production and for

112
00:09:12.175 --> 00:09:16.360
each which of those we will calculate
a corresponding daily profit value.

113
00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:20.710
First let's number our
simulation runs in column D.

114
00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:24.150
Let's put 1 in the cell D2.

115
00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:30.061
And let's keep adding ones until
we get 100 simulation runs.

116
00:09:40.321 --> 00:09:44.500
Okay, let's double check,
yes we have 100 simulation runs

117
00:09:47.441 --> 00:09:52.280
Now it is time to generate 100
random daily production values.

118
00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:55.820
These values will be stored
in the cells E2 through E101.

119
00:09:55.820 --> 00:10:02.330
In order to generate random production
values we will use the Analysis ToolPak.

120
00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:07.060
We go to Data > Data Analysis,

121
00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:10.000
select Random Number Generation, click OK.

122
00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:17.960
In the Random Number Generation dialog,
we put 1 in the Number of Variables box.

123
00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:26.250
We put a 100 in the Number
of Random Numbers.

124
00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:32.900
So, we instruct Excel to generate 100
instances of a single random variable.

125
00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:38.910
Then in the distribution we select normal.

126
00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:44.406
And then for the parameters of
this normal we must select 35 for

127
00:10:44.406 --> 00:10:50.060
the mean and 7 for standard deviation.

128
00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:55.407
This will instruct Excel to generate 100
random instances of daily production

129
00:10:55.407 --> 00:10:58.415
values using a normal distribution
with these parameters.

130
00:10:58.415 --> 00:11:03.475
Now let's use 123 for the random seed and

131
00:11:03.475 --> 00:11:08.536
finally in the output
options we will select

132
00:11:08.536 --> 00:11:13.473
an output range, and we put cell E2 here.

133
00:11:16.533 --> 00:11:20.745
This will instruct Excel to put
the random instances of the daily

134
00:11:20.745 --> 00:11:24.414
production values into
the cells E2 through E101.

135
00:11:24.414 --> 00:11:26.060
Now let's click OK.

136
00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:34.770
Excel has now filled the cells, E2 through
E101 with random instances of the normal

137
00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:39.630
random variable with mean 35 and
standard deviation seven, as we requested.

138
00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:44.760
Let's hide some rows to make
our presentation more compact.

139
00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:51.690
Select some rows, for
example 12 through 100,

140
00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:55.930
and hide.

141
00:11:57.590 --> 00:11:58.090
Here we go.

142
00:12:00.834 --> 00:12:04.518
And let's color the E column values

143
00:12:08.849 --> 00:12:13.650
And make them bold to indicate that we're
dealing with simulation inputs here.

144
00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:20.290
Okay, now it is time to turn to
the output of our simulation.

145
00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:22.150
The daily profit values.

146
00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:25.860
Let's go into the cell F2 and

147
00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:29.740
put in the formula that will calculate
the daily profit value P for

148
00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:34.650
any given value of
the production in the cell E2.

149
00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:38.010
As the formula we copied
from the slides indicates,

150
00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:42.118
we must enter in the cell
F2 the full in expression.

151
00:12:42.118 --> 00:12:48.450
= If the production,
which is E2, is less than 35,

152
00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:53.587
then the value of the profit
is given by 2,500 times

153
00:12:53.587 --> 00:12:59.245
the value of the production minus 70,000.

154
00:12:59.245 --> 00:13:04.332
Otherwise, it's equal to minus 500

155
00:13:04.332 --> 00:13:10.776
times the value of production plus 35,000.

156
00:13:13.273 --> 00:13:18.304
As the result for
this particular case indicates,

157
00:13:18.304 --> 00:13:24.279
Europa will lose more than
21,000 Euros on a such day.

158
00:13:26.102 --> 00:13:31.273
Now we copy and paste the profit formula

159
00:13:31.273 --> 00:13:38.019
from the cell F2 to
the cells F3 through F101.

160
00:13:42.373 --> 00:13:45.832
We also color the cells F2 through F101

161
00:13:50.764 --> 00:13:54.430
to indicate that we're dealing
with the output of the simulation.

162
00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:58.560
Okay, the final step is to
calculate the sample mean and

163
00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:03.770
the standard deviation of the simulated
values of the daily profit.

164
00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:08.359
Let's put the corresponding headers

165
00:14:08.359 --> 00:14:12.810
into the cells E103 and E104.

166
00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:14.270
Sample Mean.

167
00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:22.590
Simple Standard Deviation.

168
00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:25.340
And let's calculate the values themselves.

169
00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:31.170
Average of all the profit values

170
00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:39.660
and standard deviation,
STDEV of all the profit values.

171
00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:50.140
We can make them blue and bold to
indicate that those are output values.

172
00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:51.639
As the results indicate,

173
00:14:51.639 --> 00:14:55.670
the sample mean of the daily profit
value is around 8,752 Euros.

174
00:14:55.670 --> 00:15:04.131
And the simple standard
deviation is around 9,415 Euros.

175
00:15:04.131 --> 00:15:06.560
Okay, to reiterate,

176
00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:10.330
here's a snapshot of the complete
simulation setup with formulas.

177
00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:13.320
We saved it in the Excel
file called Europa Solvent.

178
00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:17.660
As the results of the simulation indicate,
the estimate for

179
00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:22.810
the expected daily profit is about
8,752 Euros, and the estimate for

180
00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:28.790
the standard deviation of the daily
profit is about 9,415 Euros.
