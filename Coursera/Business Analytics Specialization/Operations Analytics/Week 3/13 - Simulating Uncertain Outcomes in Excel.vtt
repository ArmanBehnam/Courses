00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.780
In session one, we compared decision
making processes in business settings with

2
00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:06.930
and without significant uncertainty.

3
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.930
We have used the wireless data
plan problem as an example

4
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.820
illustrating a high
uncertainty business setting.

5
00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.200
We have learned about reward and
risk measures, and in this session,

6
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.040
we will look at how we can
estimate the values of reward and

7
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.420
risk for any course of action we
choose using a simulation toolkit.

8
00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.950
Let's begin.

9
00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.140
Okay, in section two, we're going
to build an algebraic model for

10
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.340
evaluating a wireless data plan,
and then use the simulation toolkit

11
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.380
to obtain estimates of the reward and the
risk measures associated with this plan.

12
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.930
Here's a reminder of the business
context we're looking at.

13
00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.602
The current wireless data plan that
our consultant has charges $10 per

14
00:00:46.602 --> 00:00:47.815
gigabyte of data.

15
00:00:47.815 --> 00:00:54.006
The new data plan charges a fixed fee for
all data usage up to 20 gigabytes,

16
00:00:54.006 --> 00:00:59.260
and then it also charges $15
per gigabyte of data above 20.

17
00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:05.650
For example, if the data usage in
a particular month is 22 gigabytes,

18
00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:13.140
she'll have to pay $160 for the first
20 gigabytes and $30 for the next two.

19
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.084
So her total payment in
such month will be $190.

20
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.920
If, on the other hand,
her data usage in a particular month

21
00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.787
does not exceed 20 gigabytes,
her monthly payment will be just $160.

22
00:01:25.787 --> 00:01:31.170
Based on historical data usage values,
our consultant estimates

23
00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.115
that her family's monthly data usage is
normally distributed with mean 23 and

24
00:01:35.115 --> 00:01:38.520
a standard deviation of 5 gigabytes.

25
00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:47.371
So she also knows the distribution of her
monthly payments under the current plan,

26
00:01:47.371 --> 00:01:53.020
normal with mean $230 and
a standard deviation of $50.

27
00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.790
What about the distribution of
monthly payments under the new plan?

28
00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.220
If we want to estimate the reward and
the risk measures for

29
00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.560
this new plan, in other words,
the expected monthly payment and

30
00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.270
the standard deviation of
monthly payments, what are they?

31
00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.887
Let us use the verbal description of
the new plan to connect the random input,

32
00:02:11.887 --> 00:02:14.134
data usage U to the random output,

33
00:02:14.134 --> 00:02:19.196
whose probability distribution we're
interested in, monthly payment P.

34
00:02:19.196 --> 00:02:24.854
If U is below or at 20,
then the monthly payment P is 160.

35
00:02:24.854 --> 00:02:29.209
If U is above 20, then the monthly

36
00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:34.300
payment is 160 + 15 x (U- 20).

37
00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:40.830
In other words, extra payment of $15 for
every gigabyte above 20.

38
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:47.640
Now we can combine both cases
using one EXCEL formula, IF.

39
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.430
The IF formula has the following form,

40
00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:00.710
IF(Condition, Choice1, Choice2).

41
00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:04.699
This function evaluates condition and
IF happens to be true,

42
00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:07.420
then U becomes equal to Choice1.

43
00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.740
And if the condition happens to be false,
then IF becomes equal to Choice2.

44
00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:17.840
So in this case, if U is greater than 20,

45
00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:24.659
then IF selects Choice1,
which is 15 x (U- 20).

46
00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:29.881
Otherwise, it selects Choice2,
no extra payment.

47
00:03:32.935 --> 00:03:37.430
We have a formula that expresses
the monthly payment P as a function of

48
00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.710
monthly data usage U.

49
00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:41.670
So let's return to our main question.

50
00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.010
If U is distributed as a normal random
variable with mean 23 gigabytes and

51
00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.740
standard deviation of 5 gigabytes,
what is the probability distribution of P?

52
00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:57.050
What reward value does our consultant
get if she subscribes to the new plan?

53
00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:58.800
What risk will she be facing?

54
00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.950
As far as the reward is concerned, the
expected payment value, can we just plug

55
00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.690
in the expected value of U 23 into our
formula, and get the expected value of P?

56
00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.060
It's very tempting to try and

57
00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.040
get the estimate of the expected value
of a random key performance indicator

58
00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.450
by replacing all the random factors
it depends on by the expected values.

59
00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:26.477
For example, if we plug in 23 gigabytes
into that formula, we get a value of $205.

60
00:04:26.477 --> 00:04:29.350
Is this the expected value
of our monthly payment P?

61
00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:35.290
Unfortunately, while there are cases when
you can get the correct estimate for

62
00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:38.980
the expected value of a key
performance indicator in this way,

63
00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.660
in many other cases,
this is the wrong way to go.

64
00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.660
If you have a contract where payment,
P, is a linear function of U,

65
00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.750
in other words,
P is equal to U times constant plus or

66
00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:53.330
minus another constant,
then this approach will work.

67
00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:59.220
For example, in the old data plan,
our consultant pays $10 for each gigabyte.

68
00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:04.270
So under that plan, the monthly payment
P is equal to 10 times the data usage U.

69
00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:09.290
10 times U is a linear function of U, and
the expected value of P in this case is

70
00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:14.384
just 10 times the expected value of U,
or 10 times 23, which is 230.

71
00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.542
But here's a simple example showing
us how it all can go wrong.

72
00:05:19.542 --> 00:05:24.125
Let's say our data usage
U can only take 2 values,

73
00:05:24.125 --> 00:05:30.316
each with 50% probability,
18 gigabytes and 28 gigabytes.

74
00:05:30.316 --> 00:05:34.319
The expected value of U under this
probability distribution is still 23

75
00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:37.840
gigabytes, and the standard
deviation is still 5 gigabytes.

76
00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.840
Let's see what kind of
distribution we will get for

77
00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.540
the monthly payment amount, P.

78
00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:47.680
If U is 18, then P is equal to 160.

79
00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:54.181
If U is 28, then P is 280.

80
00:05:54.181 --> 00:05:59.349
The expected value of P, is 0.5

81
00:05:59.349 --> 00:06:05.421
x 160 + 0.5 x 280, $220.

82
00:06:05.421 --> 00:06:10.310
Now this is very different from
$205 we obtained earlier by

83
00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:15.820
replacing the random variable,
U, by its expectation.

84
00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:17.800
Please keep this observation in mind.

85
00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:21.680
In general, we cannot simply replace
random variables in our formulas and

86
00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.750
hope to get the right estimates
of the key performance measures.

87
00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:28.110
So we're back to asking the same question.

88
00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:31.960
What are the reward and
risk measures that describe our new plan?

89
00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:33.740
How do we estimate them?

90
00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.250
The answer is use simulation.

91
00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.780
Simulation is a tool for converting
probability distributions of random

92
00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:45.220
factors we cannot perfectly control,
like data usage, into probability

93
00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:49.580
distributions for outcomes we're
interested in, like monthly payment.

94
00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:54.710
In simulation, we'll call random factors
like data usage random inputs, and

95
00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:58.590
outcomes with distribution would
like to obtain random outputs.

96
00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:01.700
Here's how simulation works.

97
00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:03.430
In each simulation step,

98
00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:08.880
we generate a random instance of
the input quantity like data usage U.

99
00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:12.890
In other words, we know the distribution
of this random input, in our case,

100
00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:17.400
it is normal with mean 23 and
standard deviation of 5 gigabytes.

101
00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:22.399
And we will instruct Excel or
any other simulation tool we use

102
00:07:22.399 --> 00:07:25.935
to pull one value from that distribution.

103
00:07:25.935 --> 00:07:30.907
Then, we use the formula that connects
our random input U, in our case, and

104
00:07:30.907 --> 00:07:33.160
the random output P, in our case,

105
00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:38.059
to calculate the value of the output
random variable corresponding to that

106
00:07:38.059 --> 00:07:41.895
instance of the random input
variable we just generated.

107
00:07:41.895 --> 00:07:47.591
In other words, we ask a simulation tool
to generate an instance of a random data

108
00:07:47.591 --> 00:07:53.471
usage value U, and then calculate the
corresponding monthly payment value, P.

109
00:07:53.471 --> 00:07:55.969
We can repeat the simulation step,

110
00:07:55.969 --> 00:08:00.141
which we will call a simulation
run As many times as we like.

111
00:08:00.141 --> 00:08:05.650
Since at every simulation run, we convert
a random input value, such as data usage U

112
00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:11.162
into the corresponding output value, such
as payment P, the simulation basically

113
00:08:11.162 --> 00:08:16.880
converts the set of random input numbers
into a set of random output numbers.

114
00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:19.560
We will use the term input sample and

115
00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:24.110
output sample to describe the sets of
numbers generated during the simulation.

116
00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:28.100
Once we generate a sample
of output values, for

117
00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:30.740
example, is sample of payment values.

118
00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:34.318
Or can use the sample to estimate
the expected value of the output,

119
00:08:34.318 --> 00:08:37.960
standard deviation etc.

120
00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:40.950
In other words, we can estimate reward and

121
00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:45.940
risk measures that we will use later
to choose the best course of action.

122
00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:52.510
We will use Excel for running simulations
and for analysing their results.

123
00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:59.347
Specifically, we will use an Excel
add-in called Analysis Tool Pak to run

124
00:08:59.347 --> 00:09:01.080
simulations.

125
00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:05.090
This add-in is a part of standard
Excel installation on Windows.

126
00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:07.660
If you're using Mac,

127
00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:12.877
here's a link to a free software that has
similar capabilities as Analysis Tool Pak.

128
00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:16.070
If you're using Google Sheets,

129
00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:21.060
an add-on called XLMiner Will
have similar functionality.

130
00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:23.140
Okay.

131
00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:24.700
We're ready to use Excel to set up and

132
00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:29.870
run a simulation for the monthly payment
values under the new wireless data plan.

133
00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:32.864
We have created an Excel template,
dataplan_0,

134
00:09:32.864 --> 00:09:35.800
you can use to follow our setup.

135
00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:40.190
In this first example, we'll set up and
run a simulation with just

136
00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:45.670
ten simulation runs to help us
understand how simulation works.

137
00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:47.635
Okay let's go to dataplan_0.

138
00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:52.430
We start with a template dataplan_0

139
00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:56.100
that contains all the data we
need to set up a simulation.

140
00:09:56.100 --> 00:10:00.270
In our analysis,
we'll use Excel 2013 on Windows.

141
00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:03.930
We'll be setting up our simulation
using Analysis Tool Pack,

142
00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:06.180
which is a standard add-in in Excel.

143
00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:10.970
It is usually located under data
tab in the portion called analysis,

144
00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:12.340
right next to the solver button.

145
00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:19.024
If you do not see data analysis there,
you should go to file, options,

146
00:10:19.024 --> 00:10:21.980
add-ins.

147
00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:25.122
And here what says,
manage Excel add-ins, you click go, and

148
00:10:25.122 --> 00:10:28.040
you wanna make sure that
the Analysis Tool Pak is checked.

149
00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:34.020
While setting up our simulation, keep in
mind that the ultimate purpose of running

150
00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:36.190
a simulation is to obtain estimates for

151
00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:40.210
the measures of reward and
risk associated with a new data plan.

152
00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:42.590
As we discussed earlier,

153
00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:46.480
we will use the expected monthly payment
under the new plan as a measure of reward,

154
00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:49.730
and the standard deviation of monthly
payment as a measure of risk.

155
00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:57.032
Okay, in order to prepare our simulation
let's first add headers to cells C1,

156
00:10:57.032 --> 00:10:58.196
D1, and E1.

157
00:10:58.196 --> 00:11:01.353
In C1, let's enter simulation run.

158
00:11:11.916 --> 00:11:14.348
This header will indicate
that in column C,

159
00:11:14.348 --> 00:11:17.315
we will count the instances
of our random variables.

160
00:11:17.315 --> 00:11:26.021
In D1, let's put data usage,

161
00:11:26.021 --> 00:11:30.550
U in gigabytes.

162
00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:35.010
In column D, we will be generating random
instances of the monthly data usage.

163
00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:39.332
Finally, in E1,

164
00:11:39.332 --> 00:11:44.498
let's put payment, P in dollars.

165
00:11:50.454 --> 00:11:54.548
Column E will contain the monthly
payment amounts calculated

166
00:11:54.548 --> 00:11:59.047
using the random instances of
the monthly data usage from column D.

167
00:11:59.047 --> 00:12:03.635
In this example, we will generate
ten random instances of monthly data

168
00:12:03.635 --> 00:12:08.230
usages U and calculate ten corresponding
values of monthly payment P.

169
00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:12.580
Every time we generate a random
instance of data usage,

170
00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:15.780
we will count it as a simulation run.

171
00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:21.457
So let's number the simulation
runs will conduct 1 through 10,

172
00:12:21.457 --> 00:12:28.442
and place the simulation run identifiers
in column C, in cells C2 through C11.

173
00:12:39.981 --> 00:12:44.099
Okay, the actual random instances
of monthly data usage for

174
00:12:44.099 --> 00:12:49.130
each simulation run will be store
in the cells D2 through D11.

175
00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:53.020
In particular, the cell D2 will contain
the first random instance of monthly data

176
00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:58.350
usage, the cell D3 the second random
instance of monthly data usage, and so on.

177
00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:02.480
But how do we generate
those random instances?

178
00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:06.550
Well, Analysis Tool Pad provides us with
the tool to generate random numbers.

179
00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:09.170
And that's the tool we're going to use.

180
00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:13.110
Let's go to data, click on data analysis,

181
00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:16.340
select random number generation,
and click okay.

182
00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:21.450
In the random number generation dialogue,

183
00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:26.430
let's put in one,
into the number variables box.

184
00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:30.728
This tells Excel that we're going to
generate the instances of a single,

185
00:13:30.728 --> 00:13:33.584
random variable monthly
data usage in our case.

186
00:13:33.584 --> 00:13:35.567
Next, we'll put ten.

187
00:13:38.839 --> 00:13:41.860
Into number of random numbers box.

188
00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:47.729
This will instruct Excel to generate ten
random instances of monthly data usage.

189
00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:54.440
Next, in the distribution pull down menu,
we choose

190
00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:59.090
normal and specify 23 and five

191
00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:08.180
as mean and standard deviation
of the normal random variable.

192
00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:13.220
Now, we have instructed Excel to
generate ten random instances of monthly

193
00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:17.880
data usage using a normal distribution
with the parameters we specified.

194
00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:24.220
As you can see from this drop down menu,
Excel can generate random variables

195
00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:28.130
using a number of different probability
distributions, in addition to the normal.

196
00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:35.720
Now, let's put some combination
of numbers say, one,

197
00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:39.280
two, three into the random seed box.

198
00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:43.270
Random seed instructs itself to generate
random numbers from the distribution with

199
00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:45.350
specified in a particular way.

200
00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:49.780
We do not need to worry to much about
the seed value in order to run and

201
00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:51.120
interpret the simulation.

202
00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:54.530
Just keep in mind that if you
are running Excel 2013 and Windows, and

203
00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:57.970
you set up your model in
the same way as I do, and

204
00:14:57.970 --> 00:15:02.410
use the same number of simulation runs and
the same seed, you will generate exactly

205
00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:05.650
the same sequence of monthly
usage values that I do.

206
00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:09.550
So, if you want to compare your
simulation results to mine,

207
00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:13.730
you should be setting up your simulation
model in the same way as I do.

208
00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:18.150
Use the same number of simulation runs,
like ten that I use in this case, and

209
00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:21.610
the same seed, like 1, 2,
3 that I use in this case.

210
00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:25.440
In practice, it does not matter much
what seed you select as long as you run

211
00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:27.540
a fairly long simulation.

212
00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:32.410
In otherwords, as long as the value in
the number of random numbers box is high.

213
00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:35.350
We'll talk more about short
versus long simulations and

214
00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:38.070
about different seed
values later this week.

215
00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:39.050
Okay.

216
00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:42.951
One last thing, in the output options,

217
00:15:42.951 --> 00:15:48.132
let's select output range
starting in the cell D2.

218
00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:54.696
This way Excel will put the first random
monthly usage number it generates into

219
00:15:54.696 --> 00:15:55.467
the cell D2.

220
00:15:55.467 --> 00:16:00.847
The second random monthly usage
number into the cell D3 and so on.

221
00:16:00.847 --> 00:16:05.370
Now, when you click OK,
Excel will generate 10 random

222
00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:09.516
monthly data usage numbers
in cells D2 from D11,

223
00:16:09.516 --> 00:16:15.110
using the distribution and
the parameters we specified.

224
00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:19.190
The numbers in the cells D2
through D11 are all instances of

225
00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:24.420
a normal random variable with mean 23 and
standard deviation 5.

226
00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:29.300
In other words Excel generated, or
using another word, simulated for us,

227
00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:34.550
ten instances of what the future might
hold in terms of monthly data usage.

228
00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:38.250
Let's make sure that the values
in the cells D2 through

229
00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:41.790
D11 are visually distinguishable
from the other values.

230
00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:46.130
Let's change the font in
the cells into green and bold.

231
00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:48.362
We'll use this same visual designation for

232
00:16:48.362 --> 00:16:50.779
the random inputs into
our simulation models.

233
00:16:58.199 --> 00:17:00.800
Now, what about the simulation outputs?

234
00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:04.370
The quantity we're interested in
is the monthly payment amount, P.

235
00:17:05.590 --> 00:17:10.180
Let's go into the cells E2 through E11 and
put in formulas that will

236
00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:15.240
calculate the monthly payment value P,
for any monthly Data Usage, U.

237
00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:17.140
Let's start with the cell E2.

238
00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:21.850
The way the new data plan works is by

239
00:17:21.850 --> 00:17:27.330
charging $160 up front, and then by
adding $15 for each gigabyte above 20.

240
00:17:27.330 --> 00:17:32.020
Let's put this formula into
the cell E2 using the value in

241
00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:35.940
the cell D2 as the first possible
instance of the monthly data usage.

242
00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:38.980
We have already discussed
an algebraic formula that calculates

243
00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:42.910
the monthly payment for
any value of monthly data usage.

244
00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:49.582
The algebraic formula we
put in the cell E2 is $160,

245
00:17:49.582 --> 00:17:54.725
that's B5, plus if the data usage, D2,

246
00:17:54.725 --> 00:18:01.536
exceeds 20, B4,
then we're charged extra $15 for

247
00:18:01.536 --> 00:18:05.719
each gigabyte of usage above 20.

248
00:18:05.719 --> 00:18:09.559
Otherwise, there are no extra charges.

249
00:18:09.559 --> 00:18:12.783
The result in this instance is $160

250
00:18:12.783 --> 00:18:17.579
since the monthly usage in
this instance fell below 20.

251
00:18:17.579 --> 00:18:21.585
If we want to calculate the values
of monthly payment corresponding

252
00:18:21.585 --> 00:18:25.731
to the remaining nine random instances
of data usage We need to copy and

253
00:18:25.731 --> 00:18:29.199
paste the formula in E2 into
the cells E3 through E11.

254
00:18:29.199 --> 00:18:33.828
But before we do this we must
use absolute cell references for

255
00:18:33.828 --> 00:18:38.479
the cells B4, B5, and B6 for
the formula in the cell E2.

256
00:18:38.479 --> 00:18:41.810
Those are the parameters
of our data plan and

257
00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:46.499
they do not change when we copy and
paste the payment formula.

258
00:18:46.499 --> 00:18:51.419
So we go to the cell E2, And

259
00:18:51.419 --> 00:18:57.659
use the shortcut F4 to put the dollar
signs around B4, B5, and B6.

260
00:18:57.659 --> 00:19:01.967
Let's start with B5, And

261
00:19:01.967 --> 00:19:05.975
then move to B4, and

262
00:19:05.975 --> 00:19:11.328
then B6 and then B4 again.

263
00:19:15.748 --> 00:19:18.689
Okay.

264
00:19:18.689 --> 00:19:20.933
After that, we can copy and

265
00:19:20.933 --> 00:19:25.920
paste the payment formula into
the cells E3 through E11.

266
00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:34.040
So we now have 10 random
monthly payment values that

267
00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:38.560
correspond to 10 random monthly
data usage that Excel generated.

268
00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:40.450
In other words,

269
00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:46.480
Excel generated a random sample of the
future data usage values and we have used

270
00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:52.030
the payment formula to convert the sample
into a sample of future payment values.

271
00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:57.070
This random sample of payment values
is the output of our simulation.

272
00:19:57.070 --> 00:20:02.126
We will use blue color and bold font to
make sure that those values look different

273
00:20:02.126 --> 00:20:06.814
from the random input values, and
from other values on the spreadsheet.

274
00:20:15.474 --> 00:20:20.084
To facilitate the future analysis
of the results of our simulation,

275
00:20:20.084 --> 00:20:24.933
let us calculate the average and
the standard deviation of the simulated

276
00:20:24.933 --> 00:20:30.594
samples of the monthly data usage, and
the corresponding monthly payment values.

277
00:20:30.594 --> 00:20:35.480
The average of a sample of random
numbers is also called sample mean.

278
00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:38.620
And the standard deviation of
a sample of random numbers

279
00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:41.960
is also called a sample
standard deviation.

280
00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:48.930
Let's put out these headers
into the cells C13 and C14.

281
00:20:48.930 --> 00:20:52.975
Sample mean, and

282
00:20:52.975 --> 00:20:59.722
sample standard deviation.

283
00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:04.900
Let's look first at the sample
of monthly data usage,

284
00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:10.330
where we'll calculate the average of
these ten numbers in the cell D13.

285
00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:15.039
So we put in the formula,

286
00:21:15.039 --> 00:21:20.879
average of D2 through D11.

287
00:21:25.339 --> 00:21:29.809
As we can see,
the sample mean in this case is about 25.

288
00:21:29.809 --> 00:21:32.848
25 gigabytes.

289
00:21:32.848 --> 00:21:34.455
And in the cell D14,

290
00:21:34.455 --> 00:21:40.290
we will calculate the value of
the standard deviation of the same sample.

291
00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:45.460
The formula we put in the cell D14 is,

292
00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:51.269
STDEV of the same cells, (D2:D11).

293
00:21:51.269 --> 00:21:54.583
There's several formulas for calculating
the standard deviation in Excel, and

294
00:21:54.583 --> 00:21:57.140
those formulas are applicable
in different settings.

295
00:21:57.140 --> 00:22:01.630
The STDEV formula is used for
a sample of random numbers.

296
00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:09.200
The sample standard deviation for this
particular sample is around 7.8 gigabytes.

297
00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:13.320
Let's use the font for the cells D13 and

298
00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:17.680
D14, as we did for the cells D2 and D11.

299
00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:22.080
So it's a green font and bold.

300
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.000
Now we're ready to compute
the estimates of the reward and

301
00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.040
risk measures associated
with the new data plan.

302
00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:33.610
As we discussed earlier, we will use
the estimate of the expected value of

303
00:22:33.610 --> 00:22:38.500
the monthly payments as a reward measure,
and the estimate of the standard deviation

304
00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:41.440
of the monthly payments
as the measure of risk.

305
00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:47.219
In order to calculate the sample mean and
sample standard deviation for

306
00:22:47.219 --> 00:22:52.704
our sample of payment values,
all we have to do now is to just copy and

307
00:22:52.704 --> 00:22:59.276
paste the formulas from the cells D13 and
D14 into the cells E13 and E14.

308
00:22:59.276 --> 00:23:06.260
We'll use the same font scheme for
E13 and E14 as we did for

309
00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:11.245
E2 through E11, so it's blue and bold.

310
00:23:11.245 --> 00:23:17.196
So, The estimate for

311
00:23:17.196 --> 00:23:22.913
the measure of reward associated with
the new data plan is about $253 and

312
00:23:22.913 --> 00:23:26.949
the estimate for
the measure of risk is about $92.

313
00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:33.690
For completeness, here's the picture of
the Excel file data plan 10 we created

314
00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:38.070
with all the formulas that helped us
to set up and run the simulation.

315
00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:42.180
In the next session, we'll have a more
detail look at the simulation results.

316
00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:47.490
In this session, we have learned to use
simulation to estimate the reward and

317
00:23:47.490 --> 00:23:51.030
risk measure associated with any
potential decision we can make.

318
00:23:51.030 --> 00:23:54.950
Next time, we'll look at the
interpretation of the simulation results.

319
00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:58.800
In particular, we will compare the results
of short and long simulations,

320
00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:01.360
to see how precise our
simulation estimates are.

321
00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:05.710
We will also look at histograms as
a convenient way of presenting the results
