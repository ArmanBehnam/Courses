1
00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.090
In week two you have learned how to use
the optimization analytics tool kit,

2
00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:07.000
how to setup an optimization model,
how to create a spreadsheet

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.800
implementation of your model, and how to
identify the best decision using software.

4
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.360
All the examples we looked at in week two
assumed that the data you have is certain,

5
00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.620
and that the outcomes of any course of
action you choose are also certain.

6
00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:24.130
In particular, for every decision we
considered, we knew exactly what its

7
00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.790
financial impact would be and whether it
would satisfy all business requirements.

8
00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.110
This week, we'll look at the settings
where the business environment contains

9
00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.450
a substantial degree of uncertainty.

10
00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:35.980
In environments like that,

11
00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.380
a particular course of action
may lead to uncertain outcomes.

12
00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.710
For example,
uncertain values of profit or cost.

13
00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.660
How do we value it and compare
decisions when we do not know exactly

14
00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.240
how they impact our profits or costs?

15
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.600
This is what we will
focus on in week three.

16
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.340
In particular, we will learn how to use
another important analytics tool kit,

17
00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.770
simulation.

18
00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:58.100
Mustering the optimization and

19
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.890
the simulation analytics tool kits will
prepare you for tackling complex business

20
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.389
decisions that involve choosing
the best alternative and uncertainty.

21
00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.500
In week three we will have
three class sessions.

22
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.870
In session one we will discuss
how different high uncertainty

23
00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.350
settings are from low uncertainty settings

24
00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.490
when it comes to charting
the best course of action.

25
00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.980
We will look at a specific example that
focuses on evaluating a wireless data

26
00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.200
plan, and
discuss the notions of reward and

27
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.000
risk that play a central role in
decision making and uncertainty.

28
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.070
In session two, we will introduce
a simulation tool kit that we will use to

29
00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:40.110
estimate measures of reward and risk when
making choices in uncertain environments.

30
00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.400
We will look at how to set up
an algebraic model for a simulation,

31
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.170
how to implement it in a spreadsheet form,
and how to run a simulation model.

32
00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.370
Finally, in session three we'll
focus on interpretation and

33
00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.630
visualization of simulation results.

34
00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.110
Let's start with session one.

35
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.170
One important feature of
low uncertainty settings,

36
00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.870
is that each particular course of
action results in certain outcomes,

37
00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:11.590
single values, rather than multi
value probability distributions.

38
00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.960
Take Zooter example, if a company chooses
to produce 500 units of each scooter,

39
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.900
it knows exactly how much
profit it will make, and

40
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.980
how much of each resource it will consume.

41
00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.310
Now, in high uncertainty settings,
the situation could be different.

42
00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.460
Let's look again at the news
vendor example from week one.

43
00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.320
Consider a product that sells for
12 talers per unit.

44
00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.100
It costs three talers to produce
one unit of this product, and

45
00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.259
all units that are not
sold cannot be salvaged.

46
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.620
In this case, as in many other settings,
decision on how many product q to put

47
00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:54.450
on the market, must be made before
the demand for the product is known.

48
00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.490
So, the overall profit,
which is the combination

49
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:05.420
of decision q and random demand d,
may also become random.

50
00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.220
Let's start with random demand.

51
00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.000
We can model the demand
using scenarios approach.

52
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.610
For example,
we can take historical demand values and

53
00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.400
use those as possible scenarios for
the future, attaching the same probability

54
00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.240
to each scenario, or
we can find a continuous

55
00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:29.320
probability distribution that provides
the best fit for our historical data.

56
00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.030
Whichever way we choose to
model the future demand,

57
00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.420
its random nature may translate
into random profit values.

58
00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:37.510
Let's look at an example.

59
00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.610
Let's choose three data points from our
historical demand values, he first one,

60
00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:50.630
29, the one from the middle,
63 and the last one observed, 41.

61
00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:57.250
Let's say we put on the market
q equals 50 units of a product.

62
00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.300
Let's calculate the profit we will
generate from each of those three

63
00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:03.310
demand values.

64
00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:10.590
If we have 50 products on the market,

65
00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.580
and the demand happens to be 29,
our profit is $198,

66
00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.670
as we produce 50 and
sell only 29 units of our product.

67
00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:26.466
On the other hand,
if the demand turns out to be 63,

68
00:04:26.466 --> 00:04:33.193
we sell all 50 units we produce,
and get a profit of 450 talers.

69
00:04:33.193 --> 00:04:40.043
Now, if the demand turns out to be 41,
we generate a profit of 342 talers,

70
00:04:40.043 --> 00:04:44.559
since we sell only 41 units
out of 50 we produce.

71
00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:52.910
So, a certain decision today results
in an uncertain outcome tomorrow.

72
00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:58.410
One q value can generate
three profit values

73
00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.900
depending on what demand
value is realized.

74
00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:06.780
So, let's compare the process of
selecting the best option in low and

75
00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.200
in high uncertainty settings.

76
00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:14.270
In low uncertainty settings, for each
combination of decision variables we must

77
00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:18.850
calculate the value of the objective, and
determine the feasibility of the solution.

78
00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:23.550
In other words, determine whether it
satisfies all problem constraints or not.

79
00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:29.132
After that,
one must find the best feasible solution.

80
00:05:31.767 --> 00:05:35.130
In contrast, in high uncertainty settings,

81
00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:39.272
we must understand how to
calculate the distribution for

82
00:05:39.272 --> 00:05:43.859
any key performance indicator,
profit, costs, etcetera.

83
00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:49.580
So, if we want to choose the best option,
we must understand how to choose

84
00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:54.340
one probability distribution, such as
the distribution of profit, over another.

85
00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:58.570
We will look at how to generate
probability distributions of key

86
00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:02.050
performance indicators such as profit,
cost, etcetera, in week three.

87
00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:07.520
In week 4 you will learn how to use
these probability distributions

88
00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:08.770
to make the best decisions.

89
00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:14.400
Let's start our analysis of how to make
decisions in high uncertainty environments

90
00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:15.610
by looking at an example.

91
00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:19.310
Consider a business analytics consultant

92
00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:23.420
that explores new options on
the wireless data plan for her family.

93
00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:30.650
She's currently subscribed to a plan that
charges $10 for each gigabyte of data.

94
00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:35.720
Now, she found an alternative plan,
and in this plan her family

95
00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:41.089
gets 20 gigabytes of data every month for
$160.

96
00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.750
In addition, for
data usage amounts above 20 gigabytes,

97
00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:49.620
the new plan will charge $15 for
each gigabyte above 20.

98
00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:55.470
For example, if monthly data usage
turns out to be 22 gigabytes,

99
00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:59.380
then the plan will charge
a fixed fee of $160

100
00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:04.260
plus 15 times $230 for
the two gigabytes of data above 20.

101
00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:08.786
So the total monthly charge in this case

102
00:07:08.786 --> 00:07:13.182
will be 160 plus 30, $190.

103
00:07:13.182 --> 00:07:14.800
Consider another example.

104
00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:18.880
Let's say that in a particular month,
the data usage is 17 Gigabytes.

105
00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:23.524
Well, in that case,
our consultant will still pay $160.

106
00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:29.150
The consultant is interested in the amount
she will have to pay on monthly basis

107
00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:30.720
under this new plan.

108
00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:34.750
Since the amount of monthly payment is
a function of monthly data usage, and

109
00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:37.680
monthly data usage cannot be
predicted with certainty,

110
00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:42.755
her monthly payment cannot be
predicted with certainty as well, but

111
00:07:42.755 --> 00:07:47.060
she can use predictive analytic methods,
like the ones discussed in week one,

112
00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:51.090
to convert the past data usage values
into a forecast for the future.

113
00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:57.571
Let's suppose that our consultant, after
analyzing past monthly data usage values

114
00:07:57.571 --> 00:08:02.718
for her family, came up with a prediction
model for the future data usage values.

115
00:08:02.718 --> 00:08:07.627
Let's say this prediction model tells
her that her future monthly data usage

116
00:08:07.627 --> 00:08:11.253
values will be distributed
as a normal random variable,

117
00:08:11.253 --> 00:08:15.880
with mean of 23 gigabytes and
a standard deviation of five gigabytes.

118
00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:22.170
Then, since under the current
plan she pays $10 per gigabyte,

119
00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:27.220
she knows that her future monthly payments
under the old plan will be distributed as

120
00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:33.720
a normal random variable with mean of
230 and a standard deviation of $50.

121
00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:38.550
This is because when we multiple
a normally distributed random variable,

122
00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:43.450
like the data usage u,
by a constant like 10,

123
00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:47.780
the result is a new random variable with
the mean equal to the product of that

124
00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:51.250
constant, and the mean value of
the old normal random variable,

125
00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:55.750
and the standard deviation equal to
the product of that constant, and

126
00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:58.520
the standard deviation of
that old random variable.

127
00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:02.820
In our case,
if we multiply random data usage u by 10,

128
00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:05.860
we get a normal random variable with
mean equal to 23 times 10, 230, and

129
00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:10.650
the standard deviation of five times 10,
50.

130
00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:15.205
In other words,
if our consultant keeps her old plan,

131
00:09:15.205 --> 00:09:19.669
she knows the distribution
of her monthly payments.

132
00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.900
So, we have a distribution of outcomes,

133
00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:27.540
monthly payments, associated with
the decision to keep the old plan.

134
00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:30.800
If we want to compare this
decision to any other decisions,

135
00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:34.290
for example a decision to
subscribe to some other plan,

136
00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:40.320
we must extract from this distribution of
outcomes some key performance indicators.

137
00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:45.690
The idea is to then use one of these
performance indicators as an objective and

138
00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:51.040
the rest is constraining factors when
choosing between different decisions.

139
00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:53.730
So, what are those performance indicators?

140
00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:55.820
Let's start with the so called reward.

141
00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:58.500
Expected value of profit or

142
00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:03.090
cost Is often used as a measure of
attractiveness of a particular decision.

143
00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:07.270
In our example an expected monthly
payment is what consultant would

144
00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:11.320
pay per month on average if she
stays with the plan forever.

145
00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:18.440
In general the lower is the expected
payment under particular plan,

146
00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:21.342
the more attractive this blend would be,
all other things being equal.

147
00:10:21.342 --> 00:10:23.770
Note that the term reward

148
00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:27.450
basically reflects the attractiveness
of a particular decision.

149
00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:31.250
So, higher reward can mean
higher expected profit, but

150
00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:33.660
it can also mean lower expected cost.

151
00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:38.880
Now, expected payment is what
one get if calculates an average

152
00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:42.660
monthly payment over
infinite number of months.

153
00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:46.170
In any particular month,

154
00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:49.830
the actual payment can be quite
different from the expected value.

155
00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:54.740
So, for any decision we consider in
high uncertainty settings we must,

156
00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:58.320
in addition to our reward measure,
have a key performance indicator or

157
00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:01.900
indicators that tell us how
risky our decision can get.

158
00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:07.190
One candidate for the measure of risk
in our wireless data plan example

159
00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:11.215
is a standard deviation of
actual monthly payments.

160
00:11:11.215 --> 00:11:16.540
The standard deviation tells us, roughly
speaking, how far away from the expected

161
00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:21.430
value our actual payments in any
particular month will be on average.

162
00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:28.700
A decision maker may prefer lower
values of the standard deviation

163
00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:31.270
of monthly payments,
all other things being equal.

164
00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:36.020
Now, a risk may mean different
things to different decision makers.

165
00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:40.070
Some would like to control the value
of the standard deviation of monthly

166
00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:45.030
payments, yet others may be concerned
about the likelihood that their payment,

167
00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:50.054
in any given month, exceeds a particular
threshold, for example $300.

168
00:11:50.054 --> 00:11:55.020
In other words, risk measures can
come in all shapes and sizes.

169
00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:59.200
They can reflect multiple key performance
indicators that a particular decision

170
00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:04.590
maker, a firm, a manager,
wants to keep track of and control.

171
00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:07.950
So, here's a road map that we will
be charting when making decisions in

172
00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:09.680
high uncertainty settings.

173
00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:13.680
First, we'll decide which key
performance indicators we will select

174
00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:17.174
as measures of reward and risk.

175
00:12:17.174 --> 00:12:21.060
Then, we will use simulation to
get the estimates for reward and

176
00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:24.440
risk measures, for all different
courses of action we consider.

177
00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.100
Finally, we will use
optimization tool kit,

178
00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:32.100
to select the best course of action using,
for example,

179
00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:37.520
reward estimate as the objective function,
and risk measures as constraints.

180
00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:43.890
Simulation tool kit is what we're
going to focus on next, and

181
00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:47.110
the process of selecting the best
alternative based on the results of

182
00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:50.310
simulation will be covered next week.

183
00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:53.800
>> In this session, we have looked at
differences in the way a decision making

184
00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:59.070
process unfolds in low uncertainty versus
high uncertainty business settings.

185
00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:01.770
We have looked at the data
plan evaluation example and

186
00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:05.650
identified performance measures,
broadly defined as reward and risk,

187
00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:10.600
that will help us to evaluate and compare
decisions in high uncertainty settings.

188
00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:14.680
Next time, we're going to look
at a simulation as a tool for

189
00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:20.090
estimating the values of reward and risk,
for any course of action we choose.

190
00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:20.880
See you in session two.
