00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.470
Welcome to the review session for
week two of Operations Analytics Scores.

2
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.980
This review session is
completely optional.

3
00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.260
If you feel confident in your knowledge
of the optimization tool kit,

4
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.750
take a look at the practice
problems we've prepared for you.

5
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.820
And if you feel ready to take
on week two homework questions.

6
00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.960
On the other hand, if you feel you can
benefit from looking at additional

7
00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.950
examples of resourceful location, and

8
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.130
network optimization models before
moving to the practice problems.

9
00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:26.050
This session is for you.

10
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:27.680
In this review,

11
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.140
we will go over two additional
examples of optimization problems.

12
00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.480
A resource allocation,
and a network management.

13
00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.940
Here's the context for
the resource allocation example.

14
00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.610
A UN agency is planning to
build housing units for

15
00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.450
victims of a recent natural disaster.

16
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.180
Four types of housing units
are considered, A, B, C, and D.

17
00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.400
Each type of housing unit
requires four basic resources,

18
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.550
bricks, iron sheets,
wooden poles, and labor hours.

19
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.910
For example, each unit of type B
requires 600 bricks, 10 iron sheets,

20
00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:09.110
32 wooden poles, and 200 labor hours.

21
00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.760
Different types of housing units provide
shelter for different numbers of people.

22
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.930
For example,
each type of B unit will house six people.

23
00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.540
Its resource has limited availability.

24
00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.580
For example, there's only 1.5 million
bricks available for this project.

25
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.490
The agency is trying to decide how many
units of each type to build, to house as

26
00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.560
many people as possible without
exceeding the resource availabilities.

27
00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.030
So we have a verbal
description of the problem.

28
00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.870
The next step is to convert this verbal
description into algebraic formulas.

29
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.370
We must identify decision variables and
write formulas for

30
00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.910
the objective function and
for the constraints.

31
00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.540
Let's start with the decision variables.

32
00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.050
We need to decide how many
units of each type to build.

33
00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:04.860
So, we let NA designate the number
of units of type A to build,

34
00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.300
and the number of units of
type B to build, and C and D,

35
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.770
the number of units of types C and
D to build respectively.

36
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.230
We have four decision variables.

37
00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.010
Okay, the agency would like to
maximize the total number of people

38
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.010
receiving shelter.

39
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.750
If it builds NA type A units

40
00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.220
the total number of people sheltered
in those units will be seven times NA.

41
00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:38.970
In the same way if it builds NB,
NC, and ND units.

42
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.252
The contributions of those decisions
to the objective function will be

43
00:02:42.252 --> 00:02:49.010
6xND+5xNC+7xND, and in this

44
00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.810
contribution were all unit types, we get
the expression for the objective function.

45
00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.250
Let's move to the constraints.

46
00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.240
First, resource availabilities.

47
00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.470
The number of required bricks cannot
exceed the availability of bricks.

48
00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:12.640
If we build N-A of type A units,
they will require 400 times N-A Bricks,

49
00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:20.050
if we build N-B of type B units,
we will require 600 times N-B bricks.

50
00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.490
And so on, 400 NC and

51
00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:29.990
300 time ND breaks for
NC type C units and ND of type D units.

52
00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:34.599
The total number of
required breaks will be

53
00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:40.820
400xNA+600xNB+400xNC+300xND.

54
00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:47.525
And that should not exceed 1.5 million
bricks that the agency has available.

55
00:03:49.104 --> 00:03:50.520
What about iron sheets?

56
00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.180
The constraint on iron
sheets looks the same way.

57
00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.700
The number of required
iron sheets cannot exceed

58
00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.520
the number of iron sheets available.

59
00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.230
So we add all the requirements for

60
00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.380
iron sheets across four unit types.

61
00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:16.396
20xNa+10xNb+25xNc=18xNd, and

62
00:04:16.396 --> 00:04:22.102
that should not exceed 100,000 iron

63
00:04:22.102 --> 00:04:27.200
sheets that the agency has available.

64
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.130
In a similar way the number
of required wooden poles

65
00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.850
cannot exceed the wooden
pole availability.

66
00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:43.174
The number of required
poles will be 35*Na + 32*Nb

67
00:04:43.174 --> 00:04:47.722
+ 26*Nc + 30*Nd.

68
00:04:47.722 --> 00:04:52.730
And that total sum cannot exceed 125,000

69
00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:56.600
wooden poles that
the agency has available.

70
00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:04.900
Finally, a similar requirement must be
satisfied for the number of labor hours.

71
00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:09.600
The total number of labor hours
available is 1.5 million, and

72
00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:15.310
that could not be exceeded by the total
requirement for the number of labor hours,

73
00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:22.060
300 times na plus 200
times nb + 200*Nc +400*Nd.

74
00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:29.930
So, let's put together all
the resource availability constraints.

75
00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:30.930
We have four of them.

76
00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:35.550
One for bricks, one for iron sheets,
one for wooden poles, and

77
00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.290
one for labour hours.

78
00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:42.845
Finally, we need to ensure that the
numbers of housing units are integer and

79
00:05:42.845 --> 00:05:45.550
non-negative.

80
00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:47.930
So this is our complete model.

81
00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:52.520
We need to identify the numbers of
each type of housing unit to build

82
00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.600
to maximize the total
number of sheltered people,

83
00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.860
subject to limitations on
our resource availabilities.

84
00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:03.320
Here's the template Housing Relief_0.

85
00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.020
We have posted it for you.

86
00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.870
You might find it useful to open and
follow my steps.

87
00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.310
So we have the problem data here.

88
00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:16.276
In order to complete our model we
need to define decision variables.

89
00:06:16.276 --> 00:06:19.730
Objective function and constraints.

90
00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:21.680
First, decision variables.

91
00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.790
In this problem, we need to determine the
number of houses of each of four types, A,

92
00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:27.640
B, C & D, to build.

93
00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:30.030
So, we need four decision variables.

94
00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:33.629
An A, and B and C and D.

95
00:06:33.629 --> 00:06:40.530
We will use the cells C5 through F5,
for those four variables.

96
00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:45.986
Let's put some trial values in the cell,
say 1,000 into each.

97
00:06:55.482 --> 00:06:59.737
Now let's use our convention to
distinguish these cells from the rest by

98
00:06:59.737 --> 00:07:01.350
making them bold and blue.

99
00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:08.670
Next, the objective function.

100
00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:09.330
In this problem,

101
00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:14.040
the UN agency is trying to maximize
the total number of sheltered people.

102
00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:18.370
So, H5 will be used to store
the value of this objective.

103
00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:20.816
The formula is sum product

104
00:07:22.859 --> 00:07:27.294
A five decision variables, C5:F5.

105
00:07:27.294 --> 00:07:31.520
And of the cells C6:F6.

106
00:07:35.165 --> 00:07:39.225
Because those cells reflect the numbers
of people sheltered in each type of

107
00:07:39.225 --> 00:07:40.070
housing unit.

108
00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:44.050
So that's the formula.

109
00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:48.711
As we can see the objective
function value for

110
00:07:48.711 --> 00:07:52.306
the current set of these certain
variables, is equal to 25,000.

111
00:07:52.306 --> 00:07:57.249
Again following our convention
let's change the font

112
00:07:57.249 --> 00:08:01.551
in the objective function cell to bold and
red.

113
00:08:01.551 --> 00:08:04.990
Finally, we need to specify
the constraints for our problem.

114
00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:08.560
In trying to maximize its objective,
the agency is restricted by the amounts of

115
00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:14.480
four resources, bricks, wooden poles,
iron sheets, and labor hours.

116
00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:18.080
So for any set of number of housing
units the agency plans to build,

117
00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:21.370
it must calculate the corresponding
resource requirements and

118
00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:26.550
ensure those requirements do not exceed
the availabilities of these resources.

119
00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:31.413
Let's first write down the formula that
calculates the required number of bricks

120
00:08:31.413 --> 00:08:35.869
associated with the set of decision
variables in the cell C5 through F5.

121
00:08:35.869 --> 00:08:38.839
We will put this formula
into the cell G10.

122
00:08:38.839 --> 00:08:42.929
So in order to calculate
the required number of bricks,

123
00:08:42.929 --> 00:08:47.803
we write down the formulas SUMPRODUCT
of our decision variables,

124
00:08:47.803 --> 00:08:51.807
C5, F5, and
the respective brick requirements for

125
00:08:51.807 --> 00:08:57.221
each type of housing unit,
which are located in the cells C10, F10.

126
00:09:01.661 --> 00:09:06.309
The resulting requirement is 1.7 million
bricks, this is more than the amount of

127
00:09:06.309 --> 00:09:10.181
bricks the agency has, but we will
let the solver sort this out later.

128
00:09:10.181 --> 00:09:13.225
Now in order to calculate
the required amounts for

129
00:09:13.225 --> 00:09:16.197
the remaining resources
we can go to cell G10,

130
00:09:16.197 --> 00:09:20.341
use the absolute cell references for
the decision variable cells.

131
00:09:29.941 --> 00:09:36.080
And then copy and paste this formula
into the cells G11 through G13.

132
00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:42.230
Just to make sure that we have
copied everything correctly,

133
00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:45.690
let's go to the cell G13 and
have a look at the formula.

134
00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:49.560
We're using the shortcut
F2 to display the formula.

135
00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:50.649
Okay, it looks correct.

136
00:09:52.689 --> 00:09:56.167
Okay, now we're ready to call the solver.

137
00:09:56.167 --> 00:10:00.510
Data > Solver.

138
00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:04.870
Now we need to specify three components
of our decision model to the solver.

139
00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:08.230
Objective function,
decision variables and constraints.

140
00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:13.839
For the objective function,
we'd point to the cell H5.

141
00:10:13.839 --> 00:10:16.021
And we want to maximize this objective,

142
00:10:16.021 --> 00:10:18.599
that's the total number
of people sheltered.

143
00:10:18.599 --> 00:10:23.908
Decision variables are the number
of units of each type to build,

144
00:10:23.908 --> 00:10:27.779
so that's C5 through F5, and constraints.

145
00:10:27.779 --> 00:10:33.874
Well, the main constraints here
are the availability of our resources,

146
00:10:33.874 --> 00:10:40.450
so we point out the cells G10 through
G13 as our resource requirements.

147
00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:44.720
And those should not exceed
our resource availabilities,

148
00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:48.000
which are stored in I10 through I13.

149
00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:53.020
We also need to tell the solver that our
decision variable is the number of housing

150
00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:55.645
units must be integer, so we'll click Add.

151
00:10:55.645 --> 00:11:03.000
We select our decision variables,
and we select int,

152
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.850
integer as an option here, we click OK and
we see that our constraint is added here.

153
00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:14.440
We wanna make sure that the number of
housing units we build is non-negative.

154
00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:19.340
We leave the solving method as it is,
GRG nonlinear.

155
00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:25.720
And in the options, we uncheck Ignore
Integer Constraints to make sure that

156
00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:31.090
our requirements for the number of housing
units to be integer is not ignored.

157
00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:38.040
We click OK, we click Solve and we see
the solution displayed on the spreadsheet.

158
00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:43.940
Here's a picture of the optimized
spreadsheet with the formulas put in.

159
00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:48.820
As you can see, the optimal portfolio of
housing units is dominated by the units of

160
00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:53.890
type D and type B with only two units
of type C recommended to be built.

161
00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:58.700
Units of type A housed seven people each,
just like the units of type D, but

162
00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:01.440
they apparently take too
much resources to build and

163
00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:03.250
are not included in the optimal solution.

164
00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:06.750
In the second example
in this review session,

165
00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:09.690
we're looking at the network
optimization problem.

166
00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:11.740
In particular,
we're considering a company,

167
00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:14.319
Columbia Parquet,
that makes hardwood floors.

168
00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:19.030
The company operates two plants
in different parts of Germany,

169
00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:20.620
plant A and plant B.

170
00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:23.310
During the next quarter,

171
00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:27.670
each plant can produce only up to
a certain amount of hardwood floors.

172
00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:32.160
For example,
plant A has a quarterly production

173
00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:37.200
capacity of 2,500 of thousand
square feet of hardwood floors.

174
00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:42.280
Company's hardwood floors
are sold in three regions.

175
00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:45.900
Each region has a minimum required
amount of hardwood floors

176
00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:48.410
it must receive in next quarter.

177
00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:52.560
Colombi may decide to ship more than
those minimum values to each region, but

178
00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:53.559
it cannot ship less.

179
00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:56.320
When shipping floors between plants and

180
00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:59.620
marketing regions,
the company incurs the following costs.

181
00:13:01.290 --> 00:13:07.000
For example, if it ships 1,000 square
feet from Plant B to region 2,

182
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.820
it will incur costs of 25.5 Euros.

183
00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:17.340
So Colombi needs to understand how
much it should ship from each plant,

184
00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:22.270
to each marketing region, to achieve
the lowest possible shipping cost,

185
00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:28.889
while ensuring that all demands are
satisfied by the available plant capacity.

186
00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:33.450
In order to convert this verbal
description of the problem

187
00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:38.060
into an algebraic one,
we must specify decision variables,

188
00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:41.080
objective function and constraints.

189
00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:43.330
So let's start with
the decision variables.

190
00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:48.360
First, two variables that count
amount ship to region 1 from plant

191
00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:50.260
A and from plant B.

192
00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:59.109
Now let's add amounts shipped
to region 2 from plant A and

193
00:13:59.109 --> 00:14:05.109
from plant B and,
the amounts shipped to region 3.

194
00:14:05.109 --> 00:14:09.849
All and all, we have six decision
variables in this network.

195
00:14:09.849 --> 00:14:13.755
The objective in this problem
is the total shipping cost,

196
00:14:13.755 --> 00:14:17.829
and it has six components,
one for each decision variable.

197
00:14:21.069 --> 00:14:25.269
On the constraints side,
we have two constrained types.

198
00:14:25.269 --> 00:14:28.940
The first one is the supply constraints.

199
00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:33.190
Plant A cannot produce and
ship more than its capacity.

200
00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:40.534
So all shipments that originate from
plant A cannot add up to more than 2,500.

201
00:14:40.534 --> 00:14:46.685
In a similar fashion, the total shipments
from plant B cannot exceed 3,000.

202
00:14:46.685 --> 00:14:51.420
Demand constraints is
the second constrained type.

203
00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:56.327
For region 1 the total shipment
must be at least the minimum demand

204
00:14:56.327 --> 00:14:58.350
requirement of 2000.

205
00:14:58.350 --> 00:15:02.920
Region 2 must receive at least 930.

206
00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:09.460
For region 3 the minimum
requirement is 2,200.

207
00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:14.020
Finally, we cannot ship negative amounts.

208
00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:17.960
Since it is possible to ship fractions of

209
00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:20.430
thousands of square feet
of hardwood floors,

210
00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:24.190
we do not impose a requirement that our
decision variables must be an integer.

211
00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:28.860
Here's the complete algebraic
formulation for the Colombi's Problem.

212
00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:33.540
We can now use the Excel template
Colombi_0 we have prepared,

213
00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:38.240
to set up the spreadsheet model and
optimize it using solver.

214
00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:44.350
As usual we start with the zero
version of the Excel file, Colombi_0.

215
00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:48.218
The first task is to define decision
variable cells on the spreadsheet.

216
00:15:48.218 --> 00:15:53.213
The decision variables in this problem are
the quantities expressed in thousand of

217
00:15:53.213 --> 00:15:57.298
square feet to be shipped from each
plant to each marketing region.

218
00:15:57.298 --> 00:16:04.042
We will put the values of those decision
variables in the cells B11 through D12.

219
00:16:04.042 --> 00:16:09.223
So for example, the cell B11 will hold
the value for the number of 1,000

220
00:16:09.223 --> 00:16:14.025
of square feet of hardwood floors to
be shipped from Plant A to Region 1.

221
00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:18.124
Let us put in some trial values
into the decision variable cells.

222
00:16:18.124 --> 00:16:20.792
Say, 1,000 for each cell.

223
00:16:34.709 --> 00:16:36.842
As before, we use blue color and

224
00:16:36.842 --> 00:16:41.667
bold font to distinguish the decision
variable cells from other cells.

225
00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:47.360
Now the objective function.

226
00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:52.500
In the Columbi example, the objective
function is the total shipping cost.

227
00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:55.590
This is the objective function
the company would like to minimize.

228
00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:59.640
We'll place the formula for
this objective function into the cell F3.

229
00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:07.710
We start with the equality sign and put in
SUMPRODUCT of our decision variable cells,

230
00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:13.478
B11, D12, and
the corresponding transportation costs,

231
00:17:13.478 --> 00:17:17.441
B6 through D7.

232
00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:25.840
The result in the cell F3 is,
according to Excel, 124,000 euros.

233
00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:29.460
So we have the objective function cell.

234
00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:33.350
Let's change the font in this cell to
bold and red, for it to stand out.

235
00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:35.950
Now it's constraint's turn.

236
00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:40.240
In the Columbia example, we have two plan
capacity constraints and thee market and

237
00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:42.290
region demand constraints.

238
00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:45.380
On the capacity side,
the total amount shipped from each plant

239
00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:48.520
cannot exceed that plant's
manufacturing capacity.

240
00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:53.070
In a cell e11, let's calculate
the total amount shipped from plant A.

241
00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:59.216
So we write, SUM of B11,

242
00:17:59.216 --> 00:18:02.917
C11, and D11.

243
00:18:02.917 --> 00:18:08.459
And we get the result for the trial
values of decision variables, 3000.

244
00:18:08.459 --> 00:18:11.031
This amount exceeds
the Plant A capacity so

245
00:18:11.031 --> 00:18:15.676
the solar will have to adjust the values
of the decision variables to make sure

246
00:18:15.676 --> 00:18:18.041
that we have a feasible shipping plan.

247
00:18:18.041 --> 00:18:21.223
Now we can copy and
paste the formula in the cell

248
00:18:21.223 --> 00:18:26.126
E11 into the cell E12 to calculate
the amount shipped from Plant B.

249
00:18:30.668 --> 00:18:32.417
3,000.

250
00:18:32.417 --> 00:18:36.400
Now let's move to the demand
constraints for each marketing region.

251
00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:38.080
We will write the formula for

252
00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:42.000
the total amount currently shipped
to Region 1 in the cell B13.

253
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:48.416
So the formula is *SUM(B11,B12).

254
00:18:53.792 --> 00:19:00.133
In a similar way, we get the amounts
shipped to Regions 2 and 3, by copying and

255
00:19:00.133 --> 00:19:05.834
pasting the formula from the cell
B13 into the cells C13 and D13.

256
00:19:09.792 --> 00:19:12.459
Now, if we look into the cell D13,

257
00:19:16.209 --> 00:19:21.015
We see that the formula there
is the sum of D11 and D12,

258
00:19:21.015 --> 00:19:26.917
which is the sum of the quantity shipped
to Region 3 from Plants A and B.

259
00:19:26.917 --> 00:19:31.420
We have specified the decision variables,
the object functions in the constraints.

260
00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:34.240
And now we can use the solver
to find out optimal solution.

261
00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:39.260
So we'll go to data, click on solver and
start with the objective function.

262
00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:42.210
Objective function cell is F3 and

263
00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:48.080
we're minimizing this objective because
this is the total shipping cost.

264
00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:52.010
The decision variables
are the cells B11 through D12 and

265
00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:57.220
there are two types of the constraints.

266
00:19:57.220 --> 00:20:02.802
First type is to make sure that
the amount shipped from each plant,

267
00:20:02.802 --> 00:20:06.501
does not exceed
the capacity of each plant.

268
00:20:11.751 --> 00:20:13.501
Let's click OK.

269
00:20:13.501 --> 00:20:18.633
The second type of constraint
is to make sure that

270
00:20:18.633 --> 00:20:24.268
whatever each region receives,
B13 through D13

271
00:20:24.268 --> 00:20:30.290
is at least what this region requested,
B15, D15.

272
00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:37.260
Now we do not need the integer constraints
here because we can ship fractional

273
00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:41.900
amounts, but we do need to specify that
our shipping quantities are now negative.

274
00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:48.000
We leave this solving method as
GRG nonlinear, we click Solve, and

275
00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.770
the optimal solution is
displayed on the spreadsheet.

276
00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:53.060
Here's the optimised spreadsheet.
