00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.460
Hi, I'm Sergei Savin.

2
00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.830
Welcome back to the second week
of Operations Analytics course.

3
00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:08.600
We're about to start
session three of this week.

4
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.960
In session two,
we have learned how to set up and

5
00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.420
solve optimization problems using Solver.

6
00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.110
As an example,
we have used a resource location problem.

7
00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.090
In this session, we will look at another
frequently encountered business setting

8
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.090
where the optimization tool kit can
be used to make the best decisions.

9
00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.260
It is a network setting, a setting
where demand and supply are spread

10
00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.690
across a network of locations, and the
goal is to make sure that the demand and

11
00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.060
supply match at the lowest possible cost.

12
00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:38.140
Let's have a look.

13
00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.890
In section two,
we used Zooter example to set up and

14
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.520
solve a resource allocation problem.

15
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.090
In this session, we will look at
a different kind of optimization,

16
00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.190
a problem where optimization
involves a network of locations.

17
00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.360
Here's the business context
we're going to analyze.

18
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.170
Keystone Dry Goods Logistics is a company
that moves goods for its customers.

19
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.910
This particular customer needs
Keystone to transport powdered drink.

20
00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.700
The network of locations that client
owns include three warehouses and

21
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.456
three distribution centers.

22
00:01:14.456 --> 00:01:19.314
Here are the warehouses,
here are the distribution centers, so

23
00:01:19.314 --> 00:01:22.520
this is the complete network.

24
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.380
From each warehouse,

25
00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.609
Keystone must transport out
a certain amount of powdered drink.

26
00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:35.801
For example, out of the Chicago
warehouse it must move exactly 20 tons.

27
00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:42.292
So here's an illustration of
what must be shipped out.

28
00:01:42.292 --> 00:01:47.778
15 tons out of Los Angeles,
20 tons out of Chicago,

29
00:01:47.778 --> 00:01:51.180
and 30 tons out of New York City.

30
00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.480
Each distribution center has
a minimum requirement for

31
00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.140
the amount it must receive.

32
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.989
For example, at least 10 tons must be
shipped to the Denver distribution center.

33
00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.030
So here's the picture illustrating
these two types of requirements.

34
00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.190
Requirements for exact amounts that
must be shipped out of warehouses, and

35
00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.380
the minimum requirements for

36
00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.710
the amounts to be shipped into
the distribution centers.

37
00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.750
Now shipping is costly.

38
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.470
Here are the costs that Keystone
will incur when shipping one ton

39
00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.210
of powdered drink from each warehouse
to each distribution center.

40
00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:36.004
For example, if it tries to ship 10
tons from New York City to Austin,

41
00:02:36.004 --> 00:02:40.736
it will incur a shipping cost of $132 for
each ton, and

42
00:02:40.736 --> 00:02:44.138
the total cost will be 132 times 10.

43
00:02:44.138 --> 00:02:47.446
$1,320.

44
00:02:47.446 --> 00:02:51.480
So here's the problem
Keystone is trying to solve.

45
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.720
It is trying to find out the cheapest
way to transport the goods

46
00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.530
while making sure that certain
amounts are moved from warehouses, and

47
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.640
some minimum amounts are delivered
to each distribution center.

48
00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.900
So let's cast this problem
formulation into three pieces.

49
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.630
What kind of decisions must Keystone make?

50
00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.170
The amounts to ship from each
warehouse to each distribution center.

51
00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.420
What objective does Keystone have?

52
00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.799
It wants to minimize the shipping cost.

53
00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.000
What kind of constraints does it face?

54
00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.490
There are supply constraints
at the warehouses and

55
00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:34.400
the demand constraints at
the distribution centers.

56
00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:42.390
We can specify decision variables,
objective function, and constraints.

57
00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.200
Let's start with decision variables.

58
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.730
The company needs to determine how much to
ship from each warehouse like Los Angeles,

59
00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.815
Chicago and
New York to each distribution center,

60
00:03:54.815 --> 00:04:00.770
Denver, Washington D.C. and Austin.

61
00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:06.000
So let's assign one variable, X LD to
stand for the amount sent from Los Angeles

62
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.650
to Denver, and another one to describe the
amount shipped from Los Angeles to Austin.

63
00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.260
And the third one,

64
00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.940
to denote the amount shipped from
Los Angeles to Washington, DC.

65
00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.436
Let's add three more
variables to designate

66
00:04:22.436 --> 00:04:27.285
shipments from Chicago to Denver,
Austin, and

67
00:04:27.285 --> 00:04:31.899
Washington, D.C. And let's do the same for

68
00:04:31.899 --> 00:04:39.136
shipments from New York City to Denver,
Austin and Washington, D.C.

69
00:04:39.136 --> 00:04:44.329
So we have 3 plus 3 plus 3,
9 decision variables.

70
00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.440
So what about the objective?

71
00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.880
Keystone tries to select
the decision variable values

72
00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.970
to make the total shipping
cost as small as possible.

73
00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:59.560
So if I try to ship XLD tons
from Los Angeles to Denver,

74
00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.170
what are the cost implications
of such a decision?

75
00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:09.270
Okay, I ship from
Los Angeles to Denver and

76
00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:13.289
it'll cost me $105.00 per ton.

77
00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:17.620
So shipping XLD tons from
Los Angeles to Denver creates a cost

78
00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:22.140
contribution of 105 times XLD.

79
00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:26.680
And shipping XLA tons from
Los Angeles to Austin

80
00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.120
creates a cost contribution
of 135 times XLA.

81
00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:37.930
In the same way, shipping XLW tons
from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C.,

82
00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:43.710
creates a cost contribution
of 153 Times XLA.

83
00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:48.170
So the objective function has three
contributions from shipments originating

84
00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:53.940
in Los Angeles, three more from
shipments that originate in Chicago,

85
00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.430
and three more from shipments
that come from New York.

86
00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:02.720
Now the objective function must be
minimized in the presence of supply

87
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:08.790
constraints at the warehouses, and demand
constraints at the distribution centers.

88
00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.380
Okay, here's a reminder of what
the supply constraints are.

89
00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:18.229
Keystone must ship exact
amounts from each warehouse.

90
00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:25.140
For example, all shipments from the Los
Angeles warehouse either to Denver or

91
00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:30.880
Washington D.C., or Austin,
must stood up to 15 tons.

92
00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:36.510
So the supply constraint for
the Los Angeles warehouse looks like this.

93
00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:39.599
In the same way, all shipments from
Chicago must add up to 20 tons.

94
00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:46.116
Finally, all shipments from
New York must add up to 30

95
00:06:46.116 --> 00:06:51.010
tons.

96
00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:53.970
So to summarize,
we have supply constraints for

97
00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:58.830
Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York.

98
00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:00.740
What about the demand constraints?

99
00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:05.920
Here's a reminder of what the requirements
for each distribution center are.

100
00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:08.770
Let's start with Denver
distributions center.

101
00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:15.950
Denver must receive at least ten tons, so
here's how this constraint will look like.

102
00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:23.960
And the Austin center must
receive at least 13 tons.

103
00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:31.400
Finally, the Washington, DC distribution
center must receive at least 20 tons.

104
00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:34.240
Here's the summary of demand constraints.

105
00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:39.291
We have one for Denve,
one for Austin, and one for

106
00:07:39.291 --> 00:07:44.298
Washington D.C. To put it all together,
we have an algebraic

107
00:07:44.298 --> 00:07:49.622
model with nine variables, and
we have expressed the objective function,

108
00:07:49.622 --> 00:07:53.879
the total shipping cost,
in terms of these nine variables.

109
00:07:53.879 --> 00:07:57.717
We have also put together expressions for
the supply constraints.

110
00:07:57.717 --> 00:08:00.056
And the demand constraints.

111
00:08:00.056 --> 00:08:04.620
We must also ensure that shipping
quantities are non-negative.

112
00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:08.190
Now, we do not have to restrict
the shipping quantities to integer values,

113
00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:10.140
since it is possible to
ship fractional amounts.

114
00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:11.430
For example, 12.5 tons.

115
00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:16.460
Now that we have formulated
an algebraic model for

116
00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:21.060
the Keystone problem, We can go to Excel,
set up a spreadsheet formulation of this

117
00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:25.220
model, and find the optimal
shipping plan using solver.

118
00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:26.370
Let's do it now.

119
00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:29.330
We have prepared for
you a template called keystone_0.

120
00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:34.760
Go ahead use it and follow the steps
we go through in setting up the model.

121
00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:36.645
Okay, here is our Excel template.

122
00:08:36.645 --> 00:08:37.950
Keystone_0.

123
00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:43.170
As you can see, the spreadsheet contains
the data for the keystone example but

124
00:08:43.170 --> 00:08:46.286
none of the formulas that we will
need to find the best solution.

125
00:08:46.286 --> 00:08:51.040
As in the example,
we must convert our algebraic optimization

126
00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:55.360
model into a spreadsheet formulation and
in order to accomplish this task

127
00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:59.290
we will define on the spreadsheet three
components of an optimization model.

128
00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:03.750
Decision variables and
objective function and constraints.

129
00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:05.640
Let's start with the decision variables.

130
00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.810
In this problem the decision variables
are the amounts of powder drink

131
00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:12.420
to ship between each warehouse and
each distribution center.

132
00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:15.160
There are three warehouses and
three distribution centers so

133
00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:17.370
we have nine decision variables.

134
00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:19.850
In our template we have
nine cells B12 to D14

135
00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:24.950
that have the header shipping
quantities let's use those cells for

136
00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:28.805
the values of our decision variables
just like we did in the zooter example.

137
00:09:28.805 --> 00:09:32.250
Let's put in some trial values
in those cells say lets put

138
00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:34.824
ten in each of those nine cells.

139
00:09:34.824 --> 00:09:41.205
Okay, shipping

140
00:09:41.205 --> 00:09:47.589
ten times from

141
00:09:47.589 --> 00:09:54.160
each warehouse to each distribution center
certainly is not a feasible solution.

142
00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:59.770
For example, the L.A. warehouse Would
need to ship out the total of 30 tons and

143
00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:02.250
it only has 15 but that's okay for now.

144
00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:04.720
Those numbers we have put into
each of the decision variables so

145
00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:08.830
they're just trial values and the solver
will be able to change those values later.

146
00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:12.490
Okay we have defined
the decision variable cells.

147
00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:16.100
Let's color them in blue and
make the font bold.

148
00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:19.763
Just like we did for the decision
variable cells in the example.

149
00:10:24.531 --> 00:10:28.220
Next the objective function cell,
in this example the objective is the total

150
00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:32.020
shipping cost and
we would like to minimize this objective.

151
00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:36.380
As the template suggests let us use the
cell F3 as the objective functions out.

152
00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:41.440
So, how do we calculate the total shipping
resulting from the shipping plan and

153
00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:43.380
the decision variable self.

154
00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:47.990
We should multiply each of nine shipping
quantities by the corresponding shipping

155
00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:55.190
costs from the cells b6 d8 and
then add those nine products.

156
00:10:55.190 --> 00:11:00.160
This all sounds like a sum product
of our decision variables and

157
00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.890
the corresponding cost values.

158
00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:07.020
Let's see how we can use the sum
product formula in this case.

159
00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:15.553
In cell F3 we type in SUMPRODUCT of our
decision variable cells B 12 d 14 and

160
00:11:15.553 --> 00:11:20.486
the corresponding cost values, B 6, D 8.

161
00:11:22.992 --> 00:11:28.789
The result is,
according to Excel, $11,570.

162
00:11:28.789 --> 00:11:32.140
So, we have the objective function cell.

163
00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:34.939
Let's change the form to bold and
red as we did for

164
00:11:34.939 --> 00:11:37.473
the objective function in the Zooder case.

165
00:11:43.249 --> 00:11:45.640
Now we move to the constraints.

166
00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:48.600
In the Keystone problem,
there are six main constraints.

167
00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:51.320
Three supply constraints,
one for each warehouse, and

168
00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:55.600
three minimum demand constraints,
one for each distribution center.

169
00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:57.480
Let's start with the supply constraint.

170
00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:00.640
The first supply constraint states
that the total amount shipped from

171
00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:03.180
the LA warehouse must be
exactly equal to 15 tons.

172
00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:09.000
Let's go to the cell E12 and calculate
the total amount shipped from the LA

173
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.590
warehouse under our trial shipping plan.

174
00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:15.840
We need to sum the shipping
amounts from the LA warehouse

175
00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:18.310
to each distribution center.

176
00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:22.470
So, we'll put in sum B12, ship to Denver,

177
00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:29.370
C12 Austin and D12 Washington.

178
00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:34.420
The result is 30 tons.

179
00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:39.410
Now we can do the same calculation for
the remaining two warehouses.

180
00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:45.669
We just copy and paste the formula in
the cell E12 to the cells E13 and E14.

181
00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:57.406
As you can see under the trial shipping
plan we're considering the amount shipped

182
00:12:57.406 --> 00:13:01.443
from each warehouse is 30 tons
that is certainly not feasible but

183
00:13:01.443 --> 00:13:03.410
let's worry about this later.

184
00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:07.870
Next we deal with the minimum
demand constraints.

185
00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:12.840
For each distribution center there is
a minimum amount that it must receive.

186
00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:15.440
Let us start with the Denver
distribution center and

187
00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:18.360
let us calculate in the cell B 15.

188
00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:21.020
The the total amount this
distribution will receive

189
00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:22.350
under the current shipping plan.

190
00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:28.730
We are summing the shipping quantities

191
00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:33.999
that go to Denver from each warehouse,

192
00:13:33.999 --> 00:13:38.638
SUM of B12, B13, and B14.

193
00:13:42.639 --> 00:13:46.861
And the answer is 30 tons.

194
00:13:46.861 --> 00:13:50.627
We can do the same calculation for
the remaining two distribution centers.

195
00:13:50.627 --> 00:13:53.688
All we have to do is to copy and

196
00:13:53.688 --> 00:13:59.692
paste the formula in B15
to the cells C15 and D15.

197
00:14:05.291 --> 00:14:12.179
This is, for example,
what we have now in D15.

198
00:14:12.179 --> 00:14:16.879
It sums the shipping quantities
that go to Washington from LA,

199
00:14:16.879 --> 00:14:19.104
Chicago, and New York City.

200
00:14:21.751 --> 00:14:25.059
We have specified the decision variables,
the objective function, and

201
00:14:25.059 --> 00:14:27.970
the constraints and
we are ready to call the solver.

202
00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:30.180
We go to data, we click on solver.

203
00:14:32.055 --> 00:14:34.840
Let's first show the solver
where the objective function is.

204
00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:36.731
It is in the cell F 3.

205
00:14:39.464 --> 00:14:42.120
And this time,
we would like to minimize that function.

206
00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:46.860
In other words, we would like to make
the shipping cost as small as possible.

207
00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:51.660
Next, we specify where our
decision variable are.

208
00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:57.240
They're located in the cells,
B12 though D14.

209
00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:01.490
Finally the constraints.

210
00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:04.840
The supply constraint state that
whatever amounts which was to ship,

211
00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:07.250
the total shipping amount
from each warehouse,

212
00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:10.750
must be exactly equal to
the amount we have specified.

213
00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:15.732
So, we click add and
tell the solver that the number is

214
00:15:15.732 --> 00:15:20.161
in the cells E 12 through
E 14 must be exactly

215
00:15:20.161 --> 00:15:24.723
equal to the numbers in the cells G12,
G14.

216
00:15:28.295 --> 00:15:33.423
The minimum demand
constraints state that each

217
00:15:33.423 --> 00:15:39.960
distribution center can not get
less than what is required,

218
00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:45.086
thus we click Add again and
state that numbers in

219
00:15:45.086 --> 00:15:49.956
the cell B15, D15 must be greater than or

220
00:15:49.956 --> 00:15:56.132
equal to the value specified
in the cells B17, D17.

221
00:15:59.513 --> 00:16:04.210
We do not need to specify that
the shipped amounts are integer.

222
00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:08.200
We can ship 9.4 tons between
a particular warehouse and

223
00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:10.696
a particular distribution
center if we choose to,

224
00:16:10.696 --> 00:16:16.040
which have the non-negativity of
the decision variable selection.

225
00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:20.920
We leave the solver method as it is.

226
00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:23.910
The GRG now linear, and we click Solve.

227
00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:29.690
Here's our optimal solution.

228
00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:34.674
Here's the picture of
the optimized spreadsheet.

229
00:16:34.674 --> 00:16:42.427
As we can see, the lowest cost that
can be achieved here is $7485.

230
00:16:42.427 --> 00:16:46.871
Solver is a useful tool for learning
the optimization techniques using problems

231
00:16:46.871 --> 00:16:50.540
with small numbers of variables and
constraints.

232
00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:54.979
However, real size problems represent
a serious challenge for Solver.

233
00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.930
Fortunately, there's a number of
commercially available optimization tools

234
00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:02.430
that can tackle large problems.

235
00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:05.220
The good news is that,
whether you're using Solver or

236
00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:08.450
a commercial optimization tool,
you will still have to work with

237
00:17:08.450 --> 00:17:12.050
decision variables,
objective function, and constraints.

238
00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:17.609
Here's a link to a recently compiled
list of commercial optimization tools.

239
00:17:18.815 --> 00:17:21.970
A journal called Interfaces
publishes articles on

240
00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:24.630
actual business applications
of analytics techniques.

241
00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:30.880
Interfaces' articles is a great source of
practical knowledge on how to identify

242
00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:35.020
analytic opportunities, how to build
the models, and how to implement them.

243
00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:38.050
Here we've picked two examples.

244
00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:41.960
The first article is about optimization
of profits from refinery operations at

245
00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:46.600
Chevron, one of the world's largest
integrated energy companies.

246
00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:49.080
The second is about
applying analytics tools,

247
00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:53.660
including optimization, at one of the
world's leading fashion retailers, Zara.

248
00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:56.560
Please keep in mind that,

249
00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:01.410
in practice, analytics projects may
often involve multiple analytics tools.

250
00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:05.120
In particular, optimization will need
to be combined with descriptive and

251
00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:07.240
predictive analytics tools,
like forecasting.

252
00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:12.140
Often the best course of action must
be charted in settings with significant

253
00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:13.530
uncertainty.

254
00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:15.670
We will look at such
settings in Week Three.

255
00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:20.500
We're at the end of Week Two of
operations and analytics course.

256
00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:23.870
This week we have focused on
an optimization toolkit that allows us to

257
00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:28.860
find the best course of action in business
settings with lower levels of uncertainty.

258
00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:32.410
We have used an algebraic formulation
to create a concise way of expressing

259
00:18:32.410 --> 00:18:36.280
any optimization problem by
specifying its decision variables,

260
00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:38.231
objective function, and constraints.

261
00:18:38.231 --> 00:18:42.435
We have looked at how algebraic models
should be converted to a spreadsheet

262
00:18:42.435 --> 00:18:47.785
format, and how Solver can be used as
a tool for identifying the best decisions.

263
00:18:47.785 --> 00:18:51.655
We have covered two examples of how
an optimization toolkit can be applied to

264
00:18:51.655 --> 00:18:57.257
different business contexts, resource
allocation and network optimization.

265
00:18:57.257 --> 00:19:00.807
In order to help you master the
optimization concepts and get ready for

266
00:19:00.807 --> 00:19:05.227
Week Two's homework, we have prepared
a video review session where we cover

267
00:19:05.227 --> 00:19:09.287
optimization examples similar to
the ones covered in our sessions.

268
00:19:09.287 --> 00:19:11.097
This video review session
is completely optional,

269
00:19:11.097 --> 00:19:14.227
and if you feel comfortable with
the optimization examples you have seen so

270
00:19:14.227 --> 00:19:17.360
far, you can move on to
the practice problems.

271
00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:20.340
We provide you with two practice
problems with solutions.

272
00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:23.300
One particular reason you may want
to look at the practice problems

273
00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:27.070
is that the types of questions we're
asking you to answer are very similar

274
00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:29.509
to the questions you will see
on Week Two of schoolwork.

275
00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:32.990
We hope you will find these
additional materials useful

276
00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:34.720
when you work on the homework questions.

277
00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:37.350
So, what's next?

278
00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:39.570
Remember the news fender
problem of Week One?

279
00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:43.350
It was also about making the best
decision, but in a business setting where

280
00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:48.120
the impact of any course of action
cannot be identified with certainty.

281
00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:51.280
In order to understand how to make
the best decisions in such settings,

282
00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:56.400
we must first understand how to evaluate
and compare decisions under uncertainty.

283
00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:58.870
This will be the subject of
Week Three of our course.

284
00:19:58.870 --> 00:19:59.750
See you all next week.
