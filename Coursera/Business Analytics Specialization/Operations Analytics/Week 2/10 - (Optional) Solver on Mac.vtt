00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.020
In our main video for session two, we have
looked at how to set up and solve and

2
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.830
optimization problem in Excel
2013 on the Windows platform.

3
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.930
Please make sure that you watch that
main video before looking at this one.

4
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.868
In this video, we will go over
the differences in the way the Excel and

5
00:00:17.868 --> 00:00:20.710
the solver is set up
on Mac versus Windows.

6
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.679
Here's a spreadsheet for the Zooter
problem loaded on to Excel for Mac 2011.

7
00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:32.788
On the spreadsheet, we have entered
a trial solution 500 and 500.

8
00:00:32.788 --> 00:00:35.324
And all the formulas for
the objective function and for

9
00:00:35.324 --> 00:00:36.659
the used resource amounts.

10
00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.290
First, let's find where the Solver is.

11
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.299
Solver is an Excel add-in, and in order
to locate it, you must go to Tools,

12
00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:52.474
Add-Ins, and
make sure that the Solver is checked here.

13
00:00:58.394 --> 00:01:02.710
After that the Solver will either
appear on the tools right here.

14
00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.150
Or you can find Solver
directly under Data tab.

15
00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.850
There will be a button Solver right there.

16
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.130
Before we look at the Solver,

17
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:20.350
let's go over a couple differences in
the shortcuts used on Windows versus Mac.

18
00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.320
Let's first see how we can display and
edit a formula in a particular cell.

19
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.990
On the Windows platform, we have used
the shortcut F2 for this purpose.

20
00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.750
On the Mac,
we use the shortcut Ctrl + U instead.

21
00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.940
For example, if I go to the cell F10,
where the profit formula is located.

22
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.927
I can display and
edit this formula by pressing Ctrl + U.

23
00:01:47.175 --> 00:01:48.620
Okay.

24
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.680
The second difference we want to point out
is the way you introduce absolute cell

25
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.030
references.

26
00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:00.762
On the Windows platform the shortcut for
this was F4, on Mac it is Cmd + T.

27
00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:09.852
For example, if I go into the cell E14 and
display the formula using Ctrl + U.

28
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.780
I can highlight the decision
variable cells, C10 and D10.

29
00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.680
And then I can change the addresses
of the cells between absolute and

30
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:27.012
relative by repeatedly pressing Cmd + T.

31
00:02:27.012 --> 00:02:32.110
Okay, let's call the Solver.

32
00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.241
I will do it from the Data tab.

33
00:02:38.419 --> 00:02:43.214
As you can see, the Solver dialogue
box looks pretty much the same as

34
00:02:43.214 --> 00:02:46.280
the Solver dialogue box for Windows.

35
00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.730
We specify constraints and

36
00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.050
objective function and
decision variables in the same way.

37
00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.860
We click
Make Unconstrained Variables Non-Negative,

38
00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.180
we select the same solving method.

39
00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.600
We click on Options to make sure that, for

40
00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.580
example, the Ignore Integer Constraints
is unchecked.

41
00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.230
And now we're actually ready
to click the Solve button.

42
00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.660
Let's hope it starts working.

43
00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.018
And then displays the optimal solution
right there on the spreadsheet.
