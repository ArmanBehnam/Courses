00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:01.330
Hi.

2
00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:02.710
I'm Sergei Savin.

3
00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:05.980
I'm an associate professor in the
Department of Operations, Information, and

4
00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.220
Decisions at the Wharton School.

5
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.690
I will be guiding you through weeks two
and three of operations analytics course.

6
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.860
In week one, you have looked at
the ways and means of describing and

7
00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.120
forecasting uncertain outcomes.

8
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.080
You've also been introduced
to a quintessential problem

9
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.540
of matching demand with
supply in uncertain settings.

10
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.300
A newsvendor problem.

11
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.960
In order to successfully tackle
a newsvendor challenge, we must understand

12
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.420
how to, first, evaluate any course of
action when faced with uncertainty.

13
00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.350
And, second, choose the best course of
action out of all possible alternatives.

14
00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.730
In weeks two and three,
we will learn how to use two basic

15
00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.310
business analytics tool kits
to accomplish this tasks.

16
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.220
First, in week two, we will focus
on the optimization tool kit, and

17
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.600
see how the best alternative is
selected among many choices,

18
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.020
incidents with low uncertainty.

19
00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.730
Then, in week three we will look
at high uncertainty settings, and

20
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.810
we'll use the simulation
toolkit to evaluate reward and

21
00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.460
risk associated with any
possible course of action.

22
00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.620
All this will prepare you for
week four, when this optimization and

23
00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:14.010
simulation tool kits will be used
together to identify the optimal choice.

24
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.550
Let's begin.

25
00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.360
In week two, we will look at how
to identify the best decisions

26
00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.670
in settings with low uncertainty.

27
00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.180
We'll have three class
sessions in week two.

28
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.340
In the first session, we'll look at an
example of a resource allocation problem

29
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.430
faced by a manufacturing company.

30
00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.800
Our focus will be on describing this
problem in terms of decisions the company

31
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:39.460
must make, the objective it wants to
achieve, and the constraints it faces.

32
00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.710
We'll build an analytics model that
expresses this problem using formulas

33
00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.970
that will help us later to conduct
a spreadsheet-based search for

34
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:47.790
the best decision.

35
00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.600
In session two,
we'll convert the analytics model,

36
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.860
built in session one, into a spreadsheet
form, and use an Excel add in called,

37
00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.380
Solver, to find the best course of action.

38
00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.660
Finally, in session three we will model
another decision frequently encountered in

39
00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:06.790
practice.

40
00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.160
A decision that involves shipping
goods through a network of supply and

41
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.890
demand locations.

42
00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.090
As in sessions one and two,

43
00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.050
we will build an analytics model
describing the network management problem,

44
00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.480
convert it into a spreadsheet formulation
and identify the best option using Solver.

45
00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:26.950
Let's start our session one.

46
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.510
We start our analysis of how
to make the best decisions in

47
00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.810
low uncertainty environments by
looking at this small example.

48
00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.800
In this example, a scooter manufacturer
called Zooter, is faced with a problem of

49
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.230
allocating its limited resources between
its two main products, Razor and Navajo.

50
00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.670
Navajos are slightly more
profitable than Razors.

51
00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.500
$160 of profit contribution per unit,
versus $150.

52
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.520
The company is small and

53
00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.550
it projects that this profit margins will
not be affected by the number of scooters

54
00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.300
it can realistically produce and
place on the market.

55
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.950
Each scooter model requires the use
of each of three resources.

56
00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.190
It must go through frame manufacturing,
wheels and deck assembly, and

57
00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.540
quality assurance and packaging.

58
00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.420
Razor and Navajo scooters require
different amounts of each resource.

59
00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.630
For example,
in order to produce one Razor scooter,

60
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.717
the company must spend 4 hours
in manufacturing the frame,

61
00:03:29.717 --> 00:03:35.590
1.5 hours in wheels and deck assembly,
and 1 hour in Q and A and packaging.

62
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.910
And, the corresponding numbers for
Navajo scooter is 5, 2, and .8 hours.

63
00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.330
So, as you can see, Navajos are more
profitable, take less time to do Q and

64
00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:51.060
A and packaging, but use quite a more
of frame manufacturing and wheels and

65
00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.230
deck assembly hours.

66
00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:55.550
In this problem.

67
00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:58.610
Zooter wants to plan its
production from the coming week.

68
00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:59.910
And, during that week,

69
00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.059
it estimates that its resources
will have the following limits.

70
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.630
It will have 5,610 hours of
frame manufacturing available,

71
00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.116
2,200 hours of wheels and
deck assembly available, and

72
00:04:14.116 --> 00:04:18.960
1,200 hours of quality assurance and
packaging available.

73
00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.410
So, it wants to decide how many
units of each scooter model

74
00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.570
should it plan to produce next week, so

75
00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.780
that its limited resources are allocated
in the most profitable way?

76
00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.980
Note that all the data we use in this
example are certain non-random quantities.

77
00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:39.090
In other words,
each piece of data is a single number

78
00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.070
rather than a multi-valued
probability distribution.

79
00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:43.100
For example,

80
00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:48.910
we assume that one razor scooter will make
a profit contribution of exactly $150.

81
00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:52.170
And, that its frame will take
exactly four hours to manufacture.

82
00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.590
What this implies is that any
production plan Zooter chooses for

83
00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:02.640
the next week will result in certain
non-random outcomes in terms of profit

84
00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.030
as well as resource consumption.

85
00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:09.230
The absence of randomness
is a very powerful help

86
00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:13.290
in the task of evaluating different
courses of action and selecting the best.

87
00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:19.830
In the absence of uncertainty, even very
large problems, in other words, problems

88
00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:25.000
with very large numbers of products and
resources, are easier to tackle.

89
00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.260
Assuming away uncertainty may justified
in situations where a company,

90
00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:34.170
faced with a decision, exercises fairly
strong control over its business

91
00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:38.090
environment, either because it
considers the short term planning or

92
00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:42.460
because it benefits from longer term
contracts that allow it to confidently

93
00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.790
predict future data parameters.

94
00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:48.130
Naturally, this may not be such a good
assumption in settings where significant

95
00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:52.620
uncertain factors influencing the outcomes
of managerial actions are present.

96
00:05:54.350 --> 00:06:02.340
We will have a closer look at this more
complex settings in weeks three and four.

97
00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:05.600
Okay, let's return to
the Zooter situation.

98
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.160
The analysis of any problem focused on
finding the best course of action, or,

99
00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.360
using another word,
on optimizing the course of action,

100
00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.970
must start by identifying
the decision variables.

101
00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:20.050
Decision variables reflect
actions that a manager or

102
00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:23.640
company must choose to
achieve a desired outcome.

103
00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:26.230
In a Zooter example,

104
00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:30.620
the company must decide upon the numbers
of each scooter model to produce.

105
00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:33.840
So, the decision variables are R,

106
00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:36.910
the number of Razor scooters to
produce in the coming week, and

107
00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:41.000
N, the number of Navajo scooters
to produce in the coming week.

108
00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:48.660
A solution is the particular choice
of these decision variables.

109
00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:50.280
Such as 500 and 500.

110
00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:53.980
So, if Zooter sets its
decision variables to 500 and

111
00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:57.140
500 It will earn 155,000 in profit.

112
00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:01.770
This calculation brings us to another

113
00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:05.860
important component of
an optimization model, an objective.

114
00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:08.320
Objective is a criterion such as profit or

115
00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:13.690
cost, that a company wants to make as
big as possible or as small as possible.

116
00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:16.500
In the Zooter case,
the objective is a profit and

117
00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:18.100
the company wants to maximize it.

118
00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:22.660
It is important to remember that once
we decide upon values of the decision

119
00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:26.820
variables, we should be able to
calculate the value of the objective.

120
00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:30.190
For example, if the number of
Razor scooters produces R and

121
00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:33.898
the number of Navajo scooters produces N,
the chief profit value will be

122
00:07:33.898 --> 00:07:38.790
150*R + 160*N.

123
00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:43.170
The formula that expresses objective
as a function of decision variables,

124
00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:44.750
is called an objective function.

125
00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:52.340
And, the objective function value is
what we get if we plug in a particular

126
00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:56.580
combination of decision variable
values into the objective function.

127
00:07:56.580 --> 00:08:01.780
So if we plug in 500 and
500 into that formula,

128
00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:05.924
we get the objective
function value of 155,000.

129
00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:12.110
Constraints form the third building
block of an optimization model.

130
00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:17.270
If Zooter makes 500 of each scooter model,

131
00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:20.030
how much of each limited
resource will this require?

132
00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:27.570
Well, on the frame manufacturing front,
Zooter will need 4,500 hours.

133
00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:32.170
No problem,
it has many more hours available.

134
00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:38.390
Well, whatever combination of decision
variables user selects, the number of

135
00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:44.970
required manufacturing hours cannot be
higher than the number of available hours.

136
00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:47.450
This is what we mean by constraint.

137
00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:52.550
Let's see how our production
plan of 500 of each mode

138
00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:55.400
fares in terms of other
resources it requires.

139
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.450
It is okay from the point of view
of wheels and deck assembly hours.

140
00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:05.440
What it requires, 1750 hours,
does not exceed what Zooter has available,

141
00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:06.920
2200 hours.

142
00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:10.790
The same is true regarding Q and
A and packaging hours.

143
00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:14.750
The required number 900, does not
exceed the availability that is 1,200.

144
00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:19.280
We call a solution like
that a feasible solution.

145
00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:23.760
What if the Zooter decides to
produce 500 Razor scooters, and

146
00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:26.710
bump up the production of
Navajo scooters to 750 units?

147
00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:32.310
Well, this production plan requires more
frame manufacturing hours than Zooter has.

148
00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:37.480
And, more wheels and
deck assembly hours than Zooter has.

149
00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:41.470
Well, it is still within our limit on
the number of Q and A and packaging hours,

150
00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:45.640
1100 required,
as compared to 1200 available, but

151
00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:50.970
We still cannot implement it because of
what it requires from other resources.

152
00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:54.110
We call such a solution infeasible.

153
00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:54.770
Note that, for

154
00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:59.840
the solution to be infeasible, it does
not have to violate all constraints.

155
00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:02.030
Even violating one is enough.

156
00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:06.750
So, if we want to write a constraint on
the number of frame manufacturing hours as

157
00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:11.190
a formula that contains decision
variables R and N how do we do it?

158
00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:16.360
Well, in words we'll wanna say
that the number of required

159
00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:20.910
frame manufacturing hours may not
exceed the number of available hours.

160
00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:25.608
And, as a formula, we can write

161
00:10:25.608 --> 00:10:30.164
4*R +5*N ≤ 5,610.

162
00:10:30.164 --> 00:10:33.782
What we have on the left hand side of this
constraint, to the left of the less or

163
00:10:33.782 --> 00:10:34.890
equal than sign,

164
00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:39.620
is number of frame manufacturing hours
required by any pair of R and N.

165
00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:44.230
Four hours for each unit of R and
five hours of each unit of N.

166
00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:47.850
And, what we have on the right hand inside
of this constraint, to the right of

167
00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:51.930
the less or equal than sign, is the number
of frame manufacturing hours available.

168
00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:55.600
Now we can write similar expressions for

169
00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:58.000
the constraints on
the other two resources.

170
00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.900
The first line is the expression for
the constraint on the number of wheels and

171
00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:04.580
deck assembly hours, and the second for
the constraint on the number of Q and

172
00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:05.990
A and packaging hours available.

173
00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:09.980
So, are there any other
constraints we must have?

174
00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:14.900
Well, we must make sure that our R and
N variables cannot be fractional.

175
00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:19.375
In other words,
we cannot decide to produce, for example,

176
00:11:19.375 --> 00:11:25.193
467.4 Navajo scooters, since 0.4
scooters do not really sell well.

177
00:11:25.193 --> 00:11:31.728
So, R and
N must be integer numbers like 350 or 878.

178
00:11:31.728 --> 00:11:36.490
Finally, for obvious reasons, we cannot
produce negative numbers of scooters.

179
00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:38.080
So, let us put it all together.

180
00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:41.920
We want to choose the values of
our decision variables R and

181
00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:44.806
N to make as much profit as possible.

182
00:11:44.806 --> 00:11:48.740
That's 150*R + 160*N.

183
00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:52.230
While making sure that we do not
exceed resource availabilities and

184
00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:56.960
that we manufacture integer,
non-negative scooter numbers.

185
00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:59.141
A model like that, in other words,

186
00:11:59.141 --> 00:12:03.142
the model that uses formulas that
express objective function and

187
00:12:03.142 --> 00:12:07.884
constraints in terms of decision
variables, is called an algebraic model.

188
00:12:10.316 --> 00:12:14.403
Once we convert this algebraic
formulation into a spreadsheet format,

189
00:12:14.403 --> 00:12:18.110
Solver will be the tool that
will optimize the model.

190
00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:23.160
In other words, it will find for us, the
best combination of decision variables.

191
00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.000
A few things to keep in mind.

192
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.805
An optimization module can have many
decision variables and constraints, but

193
00:12:29.805 --> 00:12:31.749
it can only have one objective.

194
00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:37.659
But, what if a company's
interest in a number of

195
00:12:37.659 --> 00:12:41.392
so-called key performance indicators,

196
00:12:41.392 --> 00:12:46.379
such as profit, cost,
customer service levels, etc?

197
00:12:46.379 --> 00:12:49.653
While in general,
it is impossible to optimize all of

198
00:12:49.653 --> 00:12:54.183
the key performance indicators at
the same time, you can always do this.

199
00:12:56.291 --> 00:12:59.438
You can choose one of them
to be an objective and

200
00:12:59.438 --> 00:13:02.760
treat the rest of them
as constraining factors.

201
00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:08.890
For example, you can try to
maximize profit while making sure

202
00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:12.820
that the resource utilization does
not exceed some threshold level.

203
00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:17.470
Here, a profit is chosen as an objective,
and

204
00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:20.430
a resource utilization forms a constraint.

205
00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:22.980
Another thing to keep in mind,

206
00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:26.330
is that some models are easier
to tackle than others.

207
00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:27.240
Look at the Zooter model.

208
00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:33.970
It contained constants, products of
decision variables and constants,

209
00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:38.959
and the addition, it can also contain
subtraction, of the resulting expressions.

210
00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:44.080
Models like that are called linear,

211
00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:48.940
since they contain only linear
functions of decision variables.

212
00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:52.010
Linear models in general
are easier to optimize.

213
00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:57.910
In other words, optimization software,
like Solver, or any commercial software,

214
00:13:57.910 --> 00:14:01.670
will have an easier time in
identifying the best decision.

215
00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:05.740
Then their harder to optimize models.

216
00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:08.550
One example of harder
models is nonlinear models.

217
00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:13.340
When a model contains products of decision
variables, ratios of decision variables,

218
00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:17.450
powers of roots of decision variables,
anything beyond linear function.

219
00:14:17.450 --> 00:14:22.190
Such model is nonlinear, and
those models are harder to optimize.

220
00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:25.171
Especially, if they have large
numbers of variables and constraints.

221
00:14:26.546 --> 00:14:30.419
Even if you're model is linear, adding
integer requirements on the decision

222
00:14:30.419 --> 00:14:34.510
variables, can also significantly
complicate optimization process.

223
00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:38.210
So, to summarize,
the easiest class of models to deal with

224
00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:43.340
are linear models with variables that
are allowed to take any fractional values.

225
00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:46.210
We will see such a model in
session three of this week.

226
00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:48.807
If you add integer requirements to
the variables of your model, or

227
00:14:48.807 --> 00:14:52.750
make it non-linear, or especially
if you do both at the same time,

228
00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:56.480
you're making the model harder to
optimize, whether you're using Solver or

229
00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:58.330
some commercial optimization software.

230
00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:04.530
This distinction may not be that important
for a small problem, like the problem

231
00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:07.948
that Zooter is trying to solve,
two variables and three constraints.

232
00:15:07.948 --> 00:15:11.810
But, it can become quite important
if the numbers of variables and

233
00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:14.240
constraints in your model is large.

234
00:15:17.190 --> 00:15:20.400
If you would like to learn more
about optimization, and the types of

235
00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:24.150
optimization models, there's a number
of books out there that can help you.

236
00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:26.198
Here are two examples.

237
00:15:28.556 --> 00:15:32.588
In this session, we have looked at the
task of selecting the best decision among

238
00:15:32.588 --> 00:15:35.478
many alternatives,
in settings where each piece of data

239
00:15:35.478 --> 00:15:39.690
that goes into a decision making
process is known with certainty.

240
00:15:39.690 --> 00:15:44.020
As an example we looked at a small
instance of a resource allocation problem

241
00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:47.550
in which two products are competing for
limited resources.

242
00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:48.370
Using his example,

243
00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:52.530
we have identified three elements that
any optimization model will have.

244
00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:56.346
Decision variables,
an objective function, and constraints.

245
00:15:56.346 --> 00:15:59.050
Even in low-uncertainty settings,

246
00:15:59.050 --> 00:16:03.060
the task of identifying the best
decision may become very challenging

247
00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:06.690
as the sheer number of possible
decisions can be very large.

248
00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:10.760
So, we may often need the help of
an optimization tool, such as Solver.

249
00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:13.620
Now, before using software
to find the best decision,

250
00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:17.790
it is very useful to express the problem
using an algebraic language.

251
00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:22.200
In particular, it can be much easier to
identify modelling mistakes by looking at

252
00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:25.730
an algebraic formulation than
by looking at a spreadsheet.

253
00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:30.560
And, an algebraic formulation may also
help you to create a well-structured,

254
00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:32.900
easy to read spreadsheet formulation.

255
00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:36.530
In the next session we'll focus on
converting an algebraic formulation

256
00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:40.510
of the Zooter problem we created,
into a spreadsheet formulation and

257
00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:44.210
on using Solver to identify
the best production decision.

258
00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:44.710
See you soon.
