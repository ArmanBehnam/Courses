00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.900
This video focuses on the set up for
the solver on Google Sheets.

2
00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.220
You should watch this video after you
watch the main video for session two.

3
00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.070
I have uploaded the spreadsheet for
the Zooter problem to Google Sheets.

4
00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:18.120
This spreadsheet reflects the trail
solution of 500 units of each Zooter time.

5
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.970
I've also entered all the formulas for
the objective function and for

6
00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:23.800
the use resource amounts.

7
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.060
On Google Sheets the solver
is one of the add-ons.

8
00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:33.010
In order to load the solver,
we need to go to add-ons,

9
00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.660
click on get add-ons,
type solver in the search box.

10
00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.066
And when you find it, install it.

11
00:00:51.631 --> 00:00:55.115
Okay, here we have solver
appearing under add-ons.

12
00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.040
A couple of comments about the shortcuts.

13
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.850
The shortcut for displaying and
editing a formula in a particular

14
00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.710
cell in Google Sheets,
is the same as in Windows F2.

15
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.177
So, if we go to the objective function
cell, F10, we can display and

16
00:01:10.177 --> 00:01:12.933
edit its content, using the same shortcut.

17
00:01:17.874 --> 00:01:22.225
The same applies to the shortcut F4
that can be used to impose absolute cell

18
00:01:22.225 --> 00:01:23.065
references.

19
00:01:23.065 --> 00:01:29.497
If we check the cell E14 and
highlight the decision variable cells,

20
00:01:37.147 --> 00:01:40.333
We can change the addresses of
the cells between absolute and

21
00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:42.280
relative by repeated pressing F4.

22
00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.930
Okay, let's scroll this over.

23
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.664
Let's select add-ons, solver, start.

24
00:01:49.664 --> 00:01:55.740
This solver dialogue window appears
on the right side of the sheet.

25
00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.970
Let's specify the objective function.

26
00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.580
In Google sheets it is
convenient to first go

27
00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.850
to the objective function
cell on the spreadsheet.

28
00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.170
And then go to the said objective.

29
00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.620
So now,
we've selected the objective function.

30
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.770
We do the same thing for
decision variables.

31
00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.340
We highlight C10 and D10 first,

32
00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.860
and then go by changing box,
and C10 and D10 appear there.

33
00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.310
Finally, constraints.

34
00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:36.320
We first click on add,
then we highlight the cells E14,

35
00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:42.290
E16, then go to the left hand side.

36
00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.750
After that, we highlight G14, G16.

37
00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.290
And go to the right-hand side and
then click okay.

38
00:02:57.773 --> 00:03:00.721
And now constrained has been added.

39
00:03:03.066 --> 00:03:06.456
Now, we need to specify that our
decision variable's our integer.

40
00:03:06.456 --> 00:03:07.919
Again, we click add.

41
00:03:10.984 --> 00:03:17.764
We highlight C10 and D10,
we go to left-hand side.

42
00:03:17.764 --> 00:03:24.869
And then in the relation box,
we select integer and we click okay.

43
00:03:30.117 --> 00:03:31.820
And we see that our constraint is added.

44
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:40.080
In solving method, we stay with
the standard SLSGRG nonlinear,

45
00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.150
because it's pretty much the same as
GRG nonlinear we used on Windows.

46
00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.166
Finally, we click on options and

47
00:03:50.166 --> 00:03:56.542
make sure that ignore
integer is unchecked and

48
00:03:56.542 --> 00:04:01.460
assume non-negative is checked.

49
00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:04.490
The last option make sure that our
decision variables are all non-negative.

50
00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:05.010
We click okay.

51
00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:09.640
And then we click solve.

52
00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.930
The solver starts working, and
then displays the optimal solution.
