Welcome to Operations Analytics.

2
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:04.411
My name is Noah Dans.

00:00:04.411 --> 00:00:05.894
&gt;&gt; I'm Sergei Sevons.

4
00:00:05.894 --> 00:00:07.680
&gt;&gt; And I'm Senthil Veeraraghavan.

5
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.550

We are very excited to
have you in the course.

8
00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:17.000
&gt;&gt; Here's what our course is all about.

9
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.860
We'll go over a number of problems that
are important to people in operations.

10
00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.330
We'll have a detailed look at one of
the fundamental problems in operations

11
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.230
called the news vendor problem.

12
00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.980
We'll also introduce you to
a range of related problems,

13
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.330
resource allocation network management and
capacity planning.

14
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.560
&gt;&gt; As we discuss these topics
we'll introduce you to methods

15
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.230
that will help you tackle a wide
variety of problems in operations

16
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.330
as well as other business functions.

17
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.500
First, we'll look at how
descriptive analytics

18
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.800
help you to characterize your data and
to forecast future events.

19
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.830
&gt;&gt; Then we'll discuss how predictive and

20
00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.270
prescriptive analytics help you
to evaluate alternatives and

21
00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:00.210
to select the best course of action both
in low and in high uncertainty settings.

22
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.070
In addition,

23
00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.130
we'll introduce you to software
tools that implement this methods.

24
00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:08.560
&gt;&gt; The course sessions include
lectures that introduce concepts

25
00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.680
as well as illustrative examples.

26
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.560
We'll extensively use Excel
to analyze these examples.

27
00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.760
Throughout the course,
we'll be posting Excel template files

28
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.600
that should be useful to you
as you review the examples.

29
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.270
In particular,
we suggest that you download these

30
00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.730
templates ahead of the lectures so
you can follow along.

31
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.320
&gt;&gt; By the end of the course, you'll be
very familiar with important problems and

32
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.270
operations and with analytics methods for
tackling them.

33
00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:35.310
&gt;&gt; Welcome once again.
