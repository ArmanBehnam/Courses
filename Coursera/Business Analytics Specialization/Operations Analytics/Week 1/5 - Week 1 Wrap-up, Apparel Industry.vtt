00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:01.780
Hi everyone.

2
00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:03.024
I'm.

3
00:00:03.024 --> 00:00:05.240
Welcome to the final session of week one.

4
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.950
We learned about forecasting techniques
in various settings in the past sessions.

5
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.770
Forecasting methods were based on
data from several past observations.

6
00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:16.432
To wrap up,

7
00:00:16.432 --> 00:00:21.420
I'm gonna talk about a specific
setting based on the apparel industry.

8
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.020
In this setting,
we'll use the same forecasting tools

9
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.250
to build a descriptive distribution
based on data from several products.

10
00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.260
Hello welcome back to Week 1,
Session 4 of Descriptive Analytics.

11
00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.725
In this week, Session 4, we're gonna
be Forecasting New Products and

12
00:00:42.725 --> 00:00:45.465
we're going to look at
how to fit distributions.

13
00:00:45.465 --> 00:00:50.350
We're going to look at a New Product
Problem, Forecasting a new product.

14
00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:51.570
In the case of new products and

15
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.050
new designs in the market,
there is very limited demand data.

16
00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.570
How do you Forecast in such settings?

17
00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.490
Often times subjective
techniques are used.

18
00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.230
Let's take a look at some of
the subjective techniques.

19
00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:06.970
Subjective Forecasting Methods.

20
00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.718
Some of the Subjective Forecasting Methods
we're interested in are through

21
00:01:11.718 --> 00:01:13.550
composites.

22
00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.990
For example,
you can look at Sales Force Composites.

23
00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.230
This is, sales personnel demand data and
they estimate,

24
00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.480
and they aggregate all the demand data.

25
00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:28.295
This aggregation of sales personal
estimates makes your composite.

26
00:01:30.198 --> 00:01:32.180
Another method to collect data or

27
00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.020
to forecast demand is to
use customer service.

28
00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.900
Or you could use a jury
of executive opinion,

29
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.110
where there is a committee
of forecasters and

30
00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.920
they come up with the forecast and
use that collective knowledge.

31
00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.130
One method that is often used
is called the Delphi method.

32
00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.330
What Delphi method does is the following.

33
00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.590
Individual opinions are compiled and
then you reconsider them over and

34
00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.610
over again until a group
consensus has reached.

35
00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.110
All of the subjective methods are
eventually based on gut feel and check.

36
00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.940
Let's look at a forecasting application.

37
00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.160
And we are looking at an outdoor
wear company called Andes.

38
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.380
Andes has the a product,
a new men's hiking shoe design.

39
00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.200
Andes Inc has sold this particular design
called the Drifter, for only one season.

40
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.910
In the past season,
they made a forecast of 1200 units.

41
00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:41.263
They made more than 1200 units,
they made Q=1500 units,

42
00:02:41.263 --> 00:02:45.497
out of which, they sold 1397 units.

43
00:02:45.497 --> 00:02:48.570
As you can see,
not much demand data is available.

44
00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.090
Now, how can Andes think about
descriptive statistics for Drifter?

45
00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.742
That's a question we're
going to be looking at.

46
00:02:59.742 --> 00:03:03.010
We're going to learn how to fit
a distribution by tracking errors.

47
00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.590
If there is limited past demand data,
like in the case of Andes for example, for

48
00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.620
new products,
we start with subjective forecasts.

49
00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.460
However, we can do better
than that with more data.

50
00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.930
If you think about it,
often there is additional demand data

51
00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.450
from other products you
have forecast in the past.

52
00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.190
That data is informative of how your
forecast deviated from the true demand.

53
00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:37.200
We will use one approach on how
to fit a normal distribution

54
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.360
to such available data.

55
00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.540
We can use other similar approaches for
other distributions.

56
00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.290
But we're going to look
at normal distribution.

57
00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:50.650
We have data from Andes Inc for
all their men's shoes.

58
00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.340
The table shows you all the products
that they made in the last season,

59
00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.720
their forecast in the second column, the
volume of production in the third column.

60
00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.480
The sales for
those products in the fourth column,

61
00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:11.010
and the demand that they saw for
all these products in the last column.

62
00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.265
For example, if you look at
the product omega, the forecast was

63
00:04:19.265 --> 00:04:24.450
2,400, they made 3000 shoes,
they sold 2967 and

64
00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:28.710
the actual demand was also 2967,

65
00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.630
all of which they sold.

66
00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:37.120
Now, the subjective forecast for
Drifter for the next season is 1000 pairs.

67
00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:41.840
What demand model should Andes use for
drifter?

68
00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.940
If you look at the previous
table that I showed you,

69
00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.310
you will notice that there is
a difference between sales and demand.

70
00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:51.460
What is sales?

71
00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.510
Sales is nothing but censored demand.

72
00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.870
For example,
if your demand was 1,000 units and

73
00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.430
you had only 800 units on the shelf,
the sales is going to be 800 units.

74
00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:06.560
You cannot meet all demand.

75
00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.520
There are several examples
where this happens.

76
00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:12.200
For example, popular music players,

77
00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.480
gaming consoles, are often sold out
because there is limited inventory.

78
00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:21.480
For most operational problems
such as the Newsvendor problem,

79
00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.760
we need the true demand distribution.

80
00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:28.770
We are interested in collecting
the true demand distribution.

81
00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:32.370
In order to do that,
one step we are going to take

82
00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:36.400
is to compare your forecast with
the actual demand in the table.

83
00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:43.890
And here is a graph that shows you the
forecast and the actual demand on a chart.

84
00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:48.701
On the x axis is forecast on
y axis is the actual demand.

85
00:05:50.488 --> 00:05:52.827
For example, here is a product for

86
00:05:52.827 --> 00:05:56.790
which the actual demand was
pretty close to the forecast.

87
00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:01.350
In general,
you'll notice that some demands

88
00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:04.680
are higher than forecast on
the upper triangle in the chart.

89
00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:10.890
And for some products, the demand was
lower than forecast, for example look at

90
00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:17.239
this product, the demand was about 1,000
and the forecast was more than 3,500.

91
00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:22.300
This chart tells you how much typically

92
00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:25.120
the true demands deviates
from your forecast.

93
00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:29.980
If your demand was exactly
equal to your forecast,

94
00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:33.590
you will be on the diagonal
line over here in the chart.

95
00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:38.220
Using the chart that we
saw in the previous slide,

96
00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:40.920
we can measure forecast performance now.

97
00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.120
In order to measure forecast performance,

98
00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:48.200
I'm gonna generate another column,
which has something called the A/F ratio.

99
00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:53.710
The A/F ratio column is nothing but
the actual demand,

100
00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:56.560
stands for A, divided by your forecast.

101
00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:01.290
In the first example, we have 796

102
00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:06.530
divided by 800 which is
almost equal to 1.00.

103
00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:12.040
So we measure the forecast versus
the actual demands, by calculating

104
00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:17.530
a ratio of the actual demand to the
forecast and this is called the AF Ratio.

105
00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:23.310
We are interested in generating
an empirical distribution function of our

106
00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:29.120
forecast accuracy, and
remember that A/F ratio is useful in

107
00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.870
developing our understanding
of forecast accuracy.

108
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:36.440
A/F ratio is just the ratio of
actual demand to the forecast.

109
00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:43.543
We evaluate these actual
demand to the forecast ratio

110
00:07:43.543 --> 00:07:47.675
of the A/F ratio for
all past observations.

111
00:07:47.675 --> 00:07:55.162
A/F ratios measure how much the actual
demand deviated from the forecast.

112
00:07:55.162 --> 00:07:59.725
If your A/F ratio was 0.8, this means that

113
00:07:59.725 --> 00:08:04.415
your actual demand was
80% of the forecast.

114
00:08:04.415 --> 00:08:08.600
The A/F ratios help us pin down the
uncertainty around the current forecast.

115
00:08:10.665 --> 00:08:13.630
We're going to learn how to choose
a normal demand distribution and

116
00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:14.420
fit it on our data.

117
00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:17.960
We start with an initial forecast.

118
00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:21.228
This comes from a subjective method,

119
00:08:21.228 --> 00:08:26.034
lets say hunches, guesses,
committee forecast etc.

120
00:08:26.034 --> 00:08:29.680
We use the initial forecast, let's assume
the initial forecast is 1,000 units.

121
00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:35.968
Then we calculate the A/F
ratios in the historical data.

122
00:08:35.968 --> 00:08:40.461
And recall, A/F ratio is just the ratio
of actual demand to forecast for

123
00:08:40.461 --> 00:08:42.830
all the products that we forecasted.

124
00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:49.710
Now how do we fit in the mu and
the sigma, that is the mean and

125
00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:51.860
the standard deviation of
the normal distribution?

126
00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:57.560
We set the mean of the normal
distribution to the following value.

127
00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:02.900
We calculate the expected A/F ratio and
multiply it by the Forecast and

128
00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:06.050
that's your mean of
the normal distribution.

129
00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:09.090
For the standard deviation
of the normal distribution,

130
00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:13.600
we calculate the standard deviation of the
af ratios and multiply it by the forecast.

131
00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:15.790
Let's look at an example.

132
00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:20.830
In our example,
we had a forecast of 1,000.

133
00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:23.900
We calculated the A/F ratios.

134
00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:26.337
The mean A/F ratio is 1.01 and

135
00:09:26.337 --> 00:09:30.791
the standard deviation of
the actual A/F ratios is .31, so

136
00:09:30.791 --> 00:09:36.254
when we multiply these by the forecast
we get the mean demand is 1,010 and

137
00:09:36.254 --> 00:09:40.224
the standard deviation of
the actual demand is 310.

138
00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:46.180
So for our descriptive data, we can fit
a normal distribution with mean 1010 and

139
00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:50.250
standard deviation 310
to represent our demand.

140
00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:55.900
Note, if you wanna predict demand for

141
00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:59.740
predictive purposes,
we need to update the demand distribution.

142
00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:03.660
We can update the normal demand
distribution as follows.

143
00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:07.423
Mean, we can just keep the same,
which is 1,010, and

144
00:10:07.423 --> 00:10:10.448
the standard deviation
needs to be corrected.

145
00:10:10.448 --> 00:10:17.750
The standard deviation will be corrected
in this data set from 310 to 390.

146
00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:22.040
If you wanna look at how the standard
deviation is corrected for

147
00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:25.930
predictive purposes,
we can go back to Session 2 and

148
00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:30.820
look at the video where I corrected
using our moving averages method.

149
00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:36.570
We just calculated the descriptive
statistics for our data, and

150
00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:38.600
we have the normal demand model.

151
00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:41.840
Here is the normal demand distribution for
our data.

152
00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:46.210
For Drifter,
we use a normal demand distribution

153
00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:50.970
with mean 1010 and standard deviation 310.

154
00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:56.560
This comes because we knew our forecast,
we knew how good our forecast was,

155
00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:02.070
which helps us measure how your forecast
will deviate from the true demand,

156
00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:04.210
and that helps us calculate
the standard deviation.

157
00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:07.920
And this is a good demand
distribution model.

158
00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:10.750
Even though we had very limited data for
a new product,

159
00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:15.150
we used our forecasting process in
the past to come up with some demand

160
00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:20.950
distribution that helps us understand how
the uncertainty in the future looks like.

161
00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:23.320
Our techniques are very
broadly applicable.

162
00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:27.665
For example, they can be used for
understanding GDP forecasts,

163
00:11:27.665 --> 00:11:30.917
Gross Domestic Product for
our country or foran economy.

164
00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:35.825
And we compare the forecast with
the actual observations and

165
00:11:35.825 --> 00:11:38.370
be confident about our
forecasting process.

166
00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:44.290
For more details, you can look at Nate
Silver's book on The Signal and the Noise,

167
00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:47.861
particularly the Chapter 6 on
Drowning in 3 feet of water.

168
00:11:51.506 --> 00:11:56.365
Another example that I will briefly
mention is a company called

169
00:11:56.365 --> 00:11:58.190
Sport Obermeyer.

170
00:11:58.190 --> 00:12:02.980
The forecasting process used in
Sport Obermeyer also measures errors.

171
00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:08.145
You can find out more about this
in a paper by Fisher and Raman.

172
00:12:08.145 --> 00:12:11.725
The paper is on Reducing the Cost
of Demand uncertainty through

173
00:12:11.725 --> 00:12:13.760
Accurate Response to Early Sales.

174
00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:18.340
So far we looked at how to generate
a demand distribution when there is

175
00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:18.910
limited data.

176
00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:24.680
The technique that helped us is
how to measure forecast errors.

177
00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:29.730
Keeping track of forecast
errors informs us how good and

178
00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:32.420
reliable our forecasts are.

179
00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:37.913
In turn, this information is useful in
characterizing the demand uncertainty,

180
00:12:37.913 --> 00:12:41.027
how your demand is
distributed in the future.

181
00:12:43.524 --> 00:12:48.050
Figuring out what's casual and
what's correlated is a hard thing to do.

182
00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:53.516
The tools I have covered leverage
the past data into coming up with

183
00:12:53.516 --> 00:12:56.206
a predictive model for future demand.

184
00:12:57.901 --> 00:13:01.730
That's it for
Descriptive Analytics, let's recap.

185
00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:03.520
We started with the Newsvendor Problem,

186
00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:09.520
we introduced Random Variables and
we looked at Demand Distributions.

187
00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:13.800
We learned how to forecast demand,

188
00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:16.700
we leaned how to forecast
with Past Historical Data.

189
00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:22.520
We looked at Forecast Errors and
Biases in Forecasts.

190
00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:26.895
We looked at two techniques,
moving averages and exponential smoothing.

191
00:13:29.959 --> 00:13:32.659
We learned how to generate
Descriptive Statistics,

192
00:13:32.659 --> 00:13:35.500
particularly mean and standard deviation.

193
00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:39.410
We learned how to adapt them for
future predictive purposes.

194
00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:42.330
We looked at Trends and Seasonality.

195
00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:46.930
Finally, we learned how to
forecast new products and

196
00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:48.270
how to fit demand distributions.

197
00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:52.450
That's it for Descriptive Analytics.

198
00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:55.050
We'll cover more tools in
the weeks to come, and

199
00:13:55.050 --> 00:14:00.270
in those weeks we'll be continuing on to
prescriptive and predictive analytics.

200
00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:03.190
It's been an exciting week.

201
00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:08.185
We saw a fundamental operations problem
called a newsvendor problem that deals

202
00:14:08.185 --> 00:14:11.699
with supply-demand matching
in uncertain settings.

203
00:14:11.699 --> 00:14:15.636
We learned how to describe
our data in such settings.

204
00:14:15.636 --> 00:14:19.733
We learned how to forecast
in stationary settings.

205
00:14:19.733 --> 00:14:21.976
We learned how to describe trend and

206
00:14:21.976 --> 00:14:25.580
seasonality as well as how to
forecast in such settings.

207
00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:32.300
Using Excel examples, we explored how to
implement these toolkits and techniques.

208
00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:38.020
The descriptive analytics that we
have learned, forms a basis for

209
00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:39.640
your future learning in this course.

210
00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:44.758
We have review material, slides for
some advanced material and

211
00:14:44.758 --> 00:14:47.320
example templates available.

212
00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:48.974
We hope you find them useful.
