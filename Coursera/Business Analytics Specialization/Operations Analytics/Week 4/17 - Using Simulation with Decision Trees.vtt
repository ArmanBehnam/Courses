00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:02.720
Hi, I'm Noah Gantz, and

2
00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:06.658
we're starting session two of Week 4
in our operations analytics course.

3
00:00:06.658 --> 00:00:11.530
In Session 1, we introduce decision
trees as a method of analyzing

4
00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.465
ideas choice of a supplier for
it's Krusbar tent.

5
00:00:15.465 --> 00:00:18.645
The demand model we used in
the example was simple, however and

6
00:00:18.645 --> 00:00:22.655
we'd like to enhance it to capture
a more complex pattern of demand.

7
00:00:22.655 --> 00:00:27.485
An extended demand model will be difficult
to evaluate using only a decision tree.

8
00:00:27.485 --> 00:00:29.335
But it will be easy to formulate and

9
00:00:29.335 --> 00:00:33.755
evaluate using the simulation tool
that Sir introduced in Week 3.

10
00:00:33.755 --> 00:00:36.780
Welcome to Week 4 session 2.

11
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.320
In this session we'll use simulation as
a tool to compliment decision trees, and

12
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.850
we'll introduce how they're used

13
00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.070
in the context of idea
supplier selection problem.

14
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.190
To get started let's remember what
ideas selection to problem was.

15
00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.650
There were two possible suppliers
one supplier S from Sweden and

16
00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.100
another supplier P from Poland.

17
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.500
Supplier S had 5,000 units of capacity,
and

18
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.073
if IDEA worked a contract with supplier S,
it would order 5,000 units.

19
00:01:08.073 --> 00:01:12.600
The fixed up front charge
from supplier S was 0, and

20
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.279
the unit cost per tent from
supplier S was 120 euros.

21
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.050
If IDEA were to contract with supplier P,
it would have to order 10,000 units.

22
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.090
Supplier P would charge IDEA
a 50,000 euro upfront charge.

23
00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.330
And the unit cost from
supplier P would be 100 euros.

24
00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.280
Remember also that at
the 150 euro selling price,

25
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.160
IDEA had a two point demand distribution.

26
00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.309
There'd be a 50% chance that
demand would be strong,

27
00:01:43.309 --> 00:01:46.009
in which case it could sell 10,000 units.

28
00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.307
And there would be a 50 % chance
that demand would be weak,

29
00:01:50.307 --> 00:01:54.119
in which case IDEA could
only sell 5,000 units.

30
00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.849
But remember,
demand may be more complex, and

31
00:01:56.849 --> 00:02:00.339
we said that we would introduce
a more complex demand model.

32
00:02:00.339 --> 00:02:02.999
That's exactly what we're
gonna do right now.

33
00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:07.310
Let's assume, for example,
that demand is uniformly distributed.

34
00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:08.540
What does that mean?

35
00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:14.750
Well a uniform distribution is defined by
a minimum outcome and a maximum outcome.

36
00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.900
Any outcome in between the given
minimum and maximum is equally likely.

37
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.290
And I am gonna show you
that in the moment.

38
00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.130
If you're interested in
uniform distributions or

39
00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.630
any other kind of distribution
such as a normal distribution,

40
00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.683
you can look it up in Analytic Text or
Statistics book.

41
00:02:30.683 --> 00:02:32.748
One that we have is by J.R. Evans.

42
00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.500
Here's the more complex demand model.

43
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.090
As before, there will be a 50 -50%
chance that demand is weak or strong.

44
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:48.667
If demand is weak, then it'll be uniformly
distributed between 2,000 and 8,000 units.

45
00:02:48.667 --> 00:02:52.698
And you can see the chart at the upper
right of the screen shows that uniform

46
00:02:52.698 --> 00:02:53.619
distribution.

47
00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:58.437
If you look at the horizontal axis,
you can see that the bar stretches from

48
00:02:58.437 --> 00:03:02.179
the 2000 unit minimum to
the 8000 unit maximum.

49
00:03:02.179 --> 00:03:05.870
And if you look at the height of the bar,
you can see it's completely even.

50
00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.320
The height of the bar
represents how likely it is,

51
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.470
when we sample from the distribution,
to get a demand with that number.

52
00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.480
And because the height is even all the way
across, that means that it's equally

53
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.780
likely that any number between 2,000 and
8,000 units will be selected.

54
00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.630
On the other hand, if demand is strong,

55
00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.720
it's also uniformly distributed, but
this time with a different range.

56
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.325
If demand's strong it'll be uniformly
distributed between 6,000 and

57
00:03:33.325 --> 00:03:34.688
14,000 units.

58
00:03:34.688 --> 00:03:39.321
And again in the chart at the lower right
of this screen you can see a uniform

59
00:03:39.321 --> 00:03:45.700
distribution that stretches from a 6,000
unit minimum to a 14,000 unit maximum.

60
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.630
Again the height of the uniform
distribution is even all the way across

61
00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.280
and that means that
when we sample from it,

62
00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.970
it will be equally likely to get any
value between 6000 and 14,000 units.

63
00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.310
How can we represent this in a tree?

64
00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:03.020
Well, let's take a look.

65
00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:08.300
Consider the choice of supplier S.

66
00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.800
What happens if IDEA chooses
supplier S and the market is weak?

67
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:17.280
Well first of all IDEA decides
to contract with supplier S, and

68
00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.030
it pays a fixed cost of 0.

69
00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.769
Remember supplier S charges
IDEA a 0 fixed cost.

70
00:04:24.829 --> 00:04:27.258
Then we find out that the market is weak.

71
00:04:27.258 --> 00:04:31.960
And that happens with probability 0.5,
or a 50% chance.

72
00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:37.910
In this case IDEA's going to order
5,000 units from Supplier S.

73
00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:38.860
And this time,

74
00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:43.700
rather than writing the number 5,000
we're gonna call the order quantity Q.

75
00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:47.120
That's gonna help us later on
when we look at Supplier P.

76
00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:52.504
If IDEA orders from Supplier S,
it's going to pay 120 euros

77
00:04:52.504 --> 00:04:58.100
per unit times Q units for
a total unicost of 120 euros times Q.

78
00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.429
Remember the demand is uniformly
distributed anywhere between 2,000 and

79
00:05:03.429 --> 00:05:05.882
8,000 units when the market is weak.

80
00:05:05.882 --> 00:05:10.370
I'm gonna call the demand,
which we don't know ahead of time, D, so

81
00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.290
that we can make a general calculation.

82
00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:18.320
So pictorially, we have another event
given that the market is weak, and

83
00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.140
that's what the demand outcome is.

84
00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:24.000
If we try to draw this on a decision tree,
you'd see there'd be many, many,

85
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.200
many branches from 2,000 all
the way up to 8,000 units.

86
00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.710
And that can quickly become unmanageable.

87
00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:32.990
So instead, we're going to use simulation.

88
00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.890
And here's how we're gonna do it.

89
00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:40.340
We're going to say if demand is
less than the quantity ordered,

90
00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:45.880
well then we know the revenue is going to
be 150 euros per unit times the demand.

91
00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:49.710
So, for example, if IDEA ordered 5000 and

92
00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:55.730
demand was 2000, IDEA would only earn
revenue on 2000 units the demand.

93
00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:59.890
On the other hand if demand
were greater than Q then

94
00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:04.610
the revenue would be 150 euros per
unit times the order quantity Q.

95
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:09.870
Again if IDEA ordered 5000 and
demand were 7000,

96
00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:14.290
IDEA would only earn revenue on
the 5000 units that it ordered.

97
00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:17.060
We can put those two
equations together and

98
00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:19.830
write a general equation that's good for
any D.

99
00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:23.310
For any D,
we can say that idea earns a revenue

100
00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:27.950
of 150 euros per unit,
times the quantity sold,

101
00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:33.350
which is just the minimum of D,
the demand, and Q, the order quantity.

102
00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:36.390
And there's a nice little Excel
function that will do that for us.

103
00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:41.890
Now that we've defined all of the cash
flows associated with the fixed cost,

104
00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:46.740
the unit order cost, and the revenues,
we can define the outcomes for

105
00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:50.550
IDEA when it orders from Supplier S and
the market is weak.

106
00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:55.350
We're going to add them together, just as
we always do, to get a general formula for

107
00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:56.270
the profit.

108
00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:59.020
And you can see that at
the bottom of the screen as well.

109
00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:04.810
Profit equals -120 euros times
the order quantity, that's the cost.

110
00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:09.800
Plus 150 euros times the minimum of
demand and Q, that's the quantity sold.

111
00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:16.460
In our case, we're gonna set Q to be 5000
for supplier S, and then we're going to

112
00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:22.410
simulate D as a uniform distribution
to estimate IDEAS expected profit.

113
00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:23.810
And, you know how to simulate.

114
00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:26.740
You saw that last week
when you worked with.

115
00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:32.250
So, let's build a spreadsheet that will
let us simulate, IDEAS average profits,

116
00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:36.180
when it orders from supplier S and
the market is weak.

117
00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:39.760
I've laid out a template
with the labels shown, so

118
00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:43.130
we can just fill it in with numbers and
formulas.

119
00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:44.930
We'll start at the top.

120
00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:49.519
If IDEA orders from supplier S,
the order quantity is 5,000.

121
00:07:51.808 --> 00:07:56.868
If IDEA orders from supplier S,
it pays no fixed cost.

122
00:07:56.868 --> 00:08:02.543
Whenever IDEA sells tenths
The unit revenue is 150 Euros and

123
00:08:02.543 --> 00:08:06.728
the unit cost from
supplier S is 120 Euros.

124
00:08:06.728 --> 00:08:10.570
The next data we need to fill
in are the demand samples.

125
00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:12.960
And you'll remember, from last week,

126
00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:16.370
that we can use Excel's random
number generator to generate them.

127
00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:21.600
We'll go up to the Data tab.

128
00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:26.920
And then, the data analysis menu item.

129
00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:29.970
And finally, random number generator.

130
00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:30.910
And click OK.

131
00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:34.650
That might be small, but I'll show
in a moment a bigger picture of it.

132
00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:39.990
What we're going to do is we're going
to tell the random number generator

133
00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:43.740
that we'd like to generate
samples from one random variable.

134
00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:47.570
We'd like to generate 10 samples.

135
00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:53.890
We'd like the random variable to be
uniformly distributed, with a minimum

136
00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:59.029
of 2,000 units, and
a maximum of 8,000 units.

137
00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:04.680
We'll use the random seed 1234
to generate the random numbers.

138
00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:08.650
Remember if you were to use exactly
the same software I'm using,

139
00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:13.330
the same version of Excel, the same
operating system, and you typed in 1234,

140
00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:16.280
you would get the same
set of random numbers.

141
00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:19.080
But if you don't get exactly
the same set don't worry,

142
00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:22.320
it could be just a subtle
difference in your software.

143
00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:26.580
The last thing that we'll do is
we'll select on output range for

144
00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:28.590
Excel to put the random numbers.

145
00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:31.780
And to do that we're going
to select the cell that

146
00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:35.000
is at the upper left of the range,
that's cell B10.

147
00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:37.249
We click OK.

148
00:09:37.249 --> 00:09:40.850
And we've generated ten random numbers.

149
00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:42.220
I'll come back to those in a minute, but

150
00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:46.300
first I wanted to show you that
random number generator dialog box.

151
00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:47.220
Here's a bigger picture.

152
00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:52.535
1 Random Variable, 10 Samples,
Uniform Distribution,

153
00:09:52.535 --> 00:09:57.235
Lower Bound of 2000,
an Upper Bound of 8000,

154
00:09:57.235 --> 00:10:02.770
Random Seed of 1234,
top of the Output Range is Cell B10.

155
00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:05.850
Okay.
Let's go back to the Excel output.

156
00:10:06.978 --> 00:10:10.460
And I wanna point out that
the random numbers that Excel

157
00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:14.220
has generated in column B
are fractional quantities.

158
00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:17.330
That's the definition of
the uniform distribution.

159
00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:19.430
It will generate random numbers.

160
00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:25.410
Equally likely anywhere between 2000 and
8000, including fractional quantities.

161
00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:30.500
Now, if you wanted to use a different
random variable that perhaps took on only

162
00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:33.130
integer quantities, you could do that.

163
00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:37.310
But, for now for convenience, we're going
to stick with the uniform distribution.

164
00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:39.910
And, I'll come back to that
a little bit later when we get

165
00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:41.669
back to our PowerPoint slides.

166
00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:47.310
Having done that,
let me clean these cells up a little bit.

167
00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:52.910
By reducing the number of digits.

168
00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:56.050
Okay, so
now we have all of the data that we need.

169
00:10:56.050 --> 00:11:00.070
We have the order quantity, the fixed
cost, the price, the unit cost, and

170
00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:01.520
the demand samples.

171
00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:05.920
And we can generate, for example,
for sample 1, our profits.

172
00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:13.500
We'll calculate the revenue
to be the 150 Euro price

173
00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:18.430
times the sales, which is just
the minimum of the order quantity

174
00:11:23.175 --> 00:11:25.170
And the actual demand.

175
00:11:27.215 --> 00:11:31.690
We can calculate the fixed
cost to be 0 in this case.

176
00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:39.053
We can calculate the variable
cost to be the unit price

177
00:11:39.053 --> 00:11:44.247
of 120 times the quantity ordered or 5000.

178
00:11:44.247 --> 00:11:51.220
And the profit is simply the revenue minus
the fixed cost, minus the variable cost.

179
00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:53.813
Lets take a look at our results for
the first sample.

180
00:11:53.813 --> 00:11:59.750
In the first sample,
the demand was for about 2,745 units.

181
00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:04.170
And the revenue is about 411,700 Euros.

182
00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:09.120
That's because the demand in this case is
lower than the order quantity of 5,000.

183
00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:12.830
So IDEA can't sell more
units than are demanded.

184
00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:17.110
And the revenue is simply
the demand times the price.

185
00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:18.990
The fixed cost is 0.

186
00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:21.330
And the variable cost is 600,000.

187
00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:27.500
And you can see when the demand is low,
IDEA loses about 188,000 euros.

188
00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:32.540
Having generated the profit for
one sample, we can simply copy and

189
00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:37.939
paste our formulas to generate
the results for the other samples.

190
00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:42.430
Now you can see that
the fixed cost never changes.

191
00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:44.660
The variable cost never changes.

192
00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:47.440
It's the revenue that's
changing with the demand.

193
00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:51.120
When demand is lower than 5,000
units the order quantity,

194
00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:53.610
the revenue depends on the demand.

195
00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:57.310
When demand is greater than 5,000 units,
for example,

196
00:12:57.310 --> 00:13:02.450
in this sample 5, then the revenue
is driven by the order quantity.

197
00:13:02.450 --> 00:13:06.000
Here you can see that
the demand is 6222 units and

198
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:12.075
the revenue is 5000 times 150 or
750,000 Euros.

199
00:13:12.075 --> 00:13:14.330
Okay.

200
00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:18.210
So we've generated ten samples of demand.

201
00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:20.660
We've calculated 10 different profits.

202
00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:22.980
And now we can calculate
the average of those profits.

203
00:13:35.701 --> 00:13:41.331
Here we can see if IDEA orders
5,000 units from supplier S,

204
00:13:41.331 --> 00:13:45.410
and has these 10 different demand samples.

205
00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:50.066
The average profit is actually
a loss of about 28,300 Euros.

206
00:13:50.066 --> 00:13:51.170
If we're interested,

207
00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:54.299
we could also calculate the standard
deviation of the profits.

208
00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:03.210
And here,
you can see it's almost 159,000 Euros.

209
00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:05.950
So, what have we done?

210
00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:09.700
We had an excel template,
and we built a simulation

211
00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:14.960
that calculated the averages profits for
IDEA from these ten demand samples.

212
00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:18.080
Of course,
ten demand samples are quite small.

213
00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:22.100
And we'd like to be able to
generate a larger simulation,

214
00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:25.300
that's much bigger than what we
can show you for this spreadsheet.

215
00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:30.140
But what we've done is built larger
simulations and taken screenshots of them.

216
00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:32.960
We'll come back to those
in the PowerPoint deck.

217
00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:37.220
Before we move on, I wanna note a couple
of important points on the simulation.

218
00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:41.450
Remember that we used
Excel's Random Number Generator

219
00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:45.850
to generate ten samples of one
random variable for demand.

220
00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:53.560
The random variable was uniformly
distributed from 2,000 to 8,000 units.

221
00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:56.527
And we use the random seed 1234.

222
00:14:56.527 --> 00:14:59.897
And you can see all of those
parameters in the dialogue box for

223
00:14:59.897 --> 00:15:03.480
the random number generator,
in the upper right of the screen.

224
00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:08.920
The second thing I wanna remind you about,
is that our samples from the uniform

225
00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:12.260
distribution include
fractional quantities.

226
00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.960
That's by definition of
the uniform distribution.

227
00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:18.570
And for simplicity,
we've used it in our example.

228
00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:23.235
There are other distributions that ensure
that samples are whole numbers, and if you

229
00:15:23.235 --> 00:15:26.960
wanna learn more about distributions,
you can look at a book on statistics or

230
00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:29.778
business analytics, for
example, the one we list here.

231
00:15:29.778 --> 00:15:34.598
The spreadsheet IDEA.xlsx
has several worksheets,

232
00:15:34.598 --> 00:15:37.749
each with a different simulation.

233
00:15:37.749 --> 00:15:40.479
Okay, let's go back to
our simulation results.

234
00:15:40.479 --> 00:15:45.961
We can rerun the simulation of supplier S,
and a weak market with 1000 samples, to

235
00:15:45.961 --> 00:15:51.539
get a better estimate of IDEA's average or
expected profits and we've done just that.

236
00:15:51.539 --> 00:15:56.539
You can take a look in the Excel
file to see the actual spreadsheet.

237
00:15:56.539 --> 00:16:03.259
Here, you can see that our estimate of
the average profits now 42,405 Euros.

238
00:16:03.259 --> 00:16:05.680
You can see that in the lower
right of the screen.

239
00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:10.580
So, what we've done is
we've used simulation

240
00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:14.120
to roll back the decision tree for
this complex event.

241
00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:17.960
Remember, first IDEA decided
to contract with supplier S

242
00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:20.270
then there was an event
that the market was weak.

243
00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:24.274
Then there was another event that the
actual demand was somewhere between 2,000

244
00:16:24.274 --> 00:16:26.460
units and 8,000 units.

245
00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:32.360
And we had a general formula for any
given Q, where we plugged in Q of 5,000,

246
00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:36.210
and also based on a random D.

247
00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:42.240
What we did was simulation is we
rolled that last node back and

248
00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:48.240
estimated the expected value of that
event node as being 42,405 Euros,

249
00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:53.350
and those are our simulation results
that we can use to compliment

250
00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:55.210
the rest of the decision tree.

251
00:16:55.210 --> 00:16:56.890
We can do the same thing for

252
00:16:56.890 --> 00:17:01.790
the other three important events
nodes in IDEAs decision tree.

253
00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:06.720
That is supplier S with a strong market,
supplier P with a weak market, and

254
00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:08.720
supplier P with a strong market.

255
00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:12.720
So let's go ahead and take a look and
see what those simulations look like.

256
00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:16.230
Here are the results for
supplier S in a strong market.

257
00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:20.370
The spreadsheet looks nearly identical,
but you can see the results of

258
00:17:20.370 --> 00:17:25.920
the simulation in column B for the demand
have numbers that look quite different,

259
00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:31.470
because they are uniformly
distributed between 6,000 and 10,000.

260
00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:37.250
In every single case you can see in
column F, the profit is 150,000 euros.

261
00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:42.200
And that's because IDEA only could
order 5,000 units from supplier S.

262
00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:46.240
So no matter what demand was,
anywhere between 6,000 and 10,000 units,

263
00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:52.920
IDEA would always sell 5,000 units and
make a profit of 150,000 euros.

264
00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:57.949
The average profits 150,000 and
the standard deviation which is

265
00:17:57.949 --> 00:18:04.008
the variation around the average is 0
because every single times is 150,000.

266
00:18:04.008 --> 00:18:08.760
The next spread sheet I'll show
you is when IDEA supplier P and

267
00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:10.100
has a weak market.

268
00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:14.982
Here we need to look carefully at
column B you can see the order

269
00:18:14.982 --> 00:18:18.429
quantity is now 10,000 in cell B3,

270
00:18:18.429 --> 00:18:23.142
you can see the fixed cost
is now 50,000 in cell B4.

271
00:18:23.142 --> 00:18:27.720
And you can see the unit cost
is now down to 100 in cell B6.

272
00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:32.990
The sample demand numbers in
the rest of column D are exactly

273
00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:38.490
the same 1,000 numbers that we had
before for supplier S in a weak market.

274
00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:42.910
Because we've used the same random seed,
one two three four.

275
00:18:42.910 --> 00:18:47.860
Again the rest of the spreadsheet's
exactly the same, and with those demand

276
00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:52.440
numbers we can calculate another 1,000
profits and calculate the average and

277
00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:58.160
we see that the average profit If IDEA
chooses supplier P and the market is weak.

278
00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:03.010
The estimated profit for
IDEA if it chooses supplier P and

279
00:19:03.010 --> 00:19:07.450
the market is weak is
293,391 Euros of loss and

280
00:19:07.450 --> 00:19:11.640
the standard deviation
is also quite large.

281
00:19:13.650 --> 00:19:17.860
The last simulation I'll show you
is when IDEA chooses supplier P and

282
00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:19.670
the market is strong.

283
00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:23.840
Again, the order quantity is 10,000,
the fixed cost is 50,000,

284
00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:27.180
and the unit cost is 100 Euros per unit.

285
00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:30.770
Then demand samples,
which you can see in the rest of column B

286
00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:34.930
are exactly the same as those
when IDEA chose supplier s and

287
00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:38.095
the market was strong because
we've used the same random seed.

288
00:19:38.095 --> 00:19:39.100
1,2,3,4.

289
00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:43.170
Again, if we look in column F
we have a 1,000 profits, and

290
00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:48.120
when we calculate the average we see our
estimate of the expected profits for

291
00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:53.750
IDEA when it chooses supplier S and the
market is strong, is around 306,500 Euros.

292
00:19:56.890 --> 00:20:00.110
So now we've got four
estimates of expected values.

293
00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:01.940
And let's take a look at
them in the decision tree.

294
00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:04.510
Here's what it looks like.

295
00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:07.180
Remember, looking from
the left to the right,

296
00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:10.320
the first node is a decision node for
IDEA.

297
00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:13.650
The first choice that IDEA could make
would be to contract with no one,

298
00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:17.790
in which case its average
profits would be 0.

299
00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:21.770
The second choice would be for
IDEA to contract with supplier S.

300
00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:23.840
In that case there
are two market outcomes.

301
00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:28.740
There'd be a weak market and a strong
market, each of course of probability .5.

302
00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:33.770
From the simulation we can see that we
estimated IDEA's expected profit for

303
00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:37.850
a weak market for
supplier S as 42,405 Euros.

304
00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:42.470
We also see that IDEA's expected profit

305
00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:47.270
with a strong market in
supplier s are 150,000 Euros.

306
00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:52.330
Finally if IDEA chooses supplier P and
the market is weak our estimate

307
00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:59.320
of ideas expected profit from this
simulation is -293,391 Euros.

308
00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:03.300
Whereas, if IDEA chooses Supplier P and
the market is strong,

309
00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:07.757
our estimate of the expected
profit is 306,540 Euros.

310
00:21:07.757 --> 00:21:11.720
Now we've got a decision
tree in the familiar form.

311
00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:15.850
And we can analyze the expected
value just as we always have.

312
00:21:19.015 --> 00:21:21.750
First we'll analyze Supplier S.

313
00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:27.120
Here we can calculate the expected
value of choosing supplier S

314
00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:32.590
as 0.5 times the outcome
when the market is weak,

315
00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:36.120
plus 0.5 times the outcome
when the market is strong.

316
00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:38.480
Or an expected value of
around 96,200 Euros.

317
00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:44.020
At the bottom we can
calculate the expected value

318
00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:46.270
of contracting with supplier P.

319
00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:49.370
Again, we use the familiar calculation of

320
00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:53.470
multiplying the probabilities with
the values given those outcomes and

321
00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:57.110
we can calculate the expected
value to be around 6,575 Euros.

322
00:21:57.110 --> 00:22:03.210
We'll substitute those expected values for
the event notes.

323
00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:07.560
Finally we're back to deciding
with whom IDEA should contract.

324
00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:11.750
And if we compare the three decision
notes, we can see contracting with no one

325
00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:16.810
brings an expected value of 0, contracting
with Supplier S brings in an estimated

326
00:22:16.810 --> 00:22:22.390
expected value of around 96,000 euros,
and contracting with Supplier P

327
00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:25.840
brings in an estimated expected
value of about 6,575 Euros.

328
00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:33.900
Contracting with supplier S clearly
maximizes the IDEA's expected value.

329
00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:35.630
We're ging to choose supplier S.

330
00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:42.055
We see though that when we choose
supplier S expected profits drop

331
00:22:42.055 --> 00:22:45.895
by about a third from the demand
model that was much simpler,

332
00:22:45.895 --> 00:22:49.435
that had only 5,000 units or
10,000 units demand.

333
00:22:49.435 --> 00:22:52.645
Before IDEA's expected
profits were 150,000,

334
00:22:52.645 --> 00:22:54.725
and now they're only around 96,000 Euros.

335
00:22:56.205 --> 00:23:01.020
Even more dramatic are IDEA's expected
profits for contracting with supplier P,

336
00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:06.530
they've dropped by more than 90% and
the simpler demand model, the expected

337
00:23:06.530 --> 00:23:11.140
value was 75,000 Euros and now
the expected value is around 6,600 Euros.

338
00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:17.099
To maximize expected profit IDEA
would still contract with supplier S.

339
00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:20.930
So that's it for session two of week four.

340
00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:25.390
How did IDEA's problem change
from last session to this one?

341
00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:29.050
Well, a lot of the overall
problem structure did not change.

342
00:23:29.050 --> 00:23:35.210
First, IDEA had to decide on a supplier,
either supplier S, supplier P, or no one.

343
00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:38.000
The fixed costs and the order
quantities were the same as before.

344
00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:40.960
Then IDEA saw if the market were weak or

345
00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:44.970
strong, the same 50/50
probabilities as before.

346
00:23:44.970 --> 00:23:48.130
What did change were the outcomes for
the weak and strong markets.

347
00:23:48.130 --> 00:23:49.930
They became more complex.

348
00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:55.240
In the initial model, when the outcome
was weak or strong, we just got numbers

349
00:23:55.240 --> 00:24:00.450
of 5,000 or 10,000, and in either case we
could simply calculate IDEA's profits.

350
00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:03.430
In the new demand model,
which is more complex.

351
00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:06.680
If demand were weak it would
be uniformly distributed, and

352
00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:09.480
if demand were strong it would
be uniformly distributed.

353
00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:12.220
In either case,
demand was still random and

354
00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:16.990
we needed to use simulation to
estimate IDEA's expected profits.

355
00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:21.540
Simulation let us evaluate the outcomes
of this more complex event.

356
00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:25.780
In the next session, you can see how
optimization in a complementary way

357
00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:28.730
to help evaluate more complex decisions.

358
00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:33.991
In this session, we added some nuance
to the model of demand for tent.

359
00:24:33.991 --> 00:24:37.240
Even after learning whether
the market would be strong or weak,

360
00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:41.720
there remains some uncertainty about the
exact number of tents that could be sold.

361
00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:45.980
We used uniform distributions to
model that residual uncertainty.

362
00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:48.730
And at the event nodes with
these uniform distributions

363
00:24:48.730 --> 00:24:52.260
we used simulation to
estimate expected values.

364
00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:55.410
So simulation was helpful
to evaluate event nodes

365
00:24:55.410 --> 00:24:58.140
whose distribution were more complex.

366
00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:02.510
Next time we'll see how we can use
optimization to evaluate complex decision

367
00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:04.730
nodes that have many potential choices.
