00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.290
Hi, I'm Noah Gans, I'm a Professor
in the Department of Operations,

2
00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:08.740
Information and
Decisions at the Wharton School.

3
00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.520
I'll be your guide for week four of our,
Operations Analytics course.

4
00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:18.080
Before we get started though, I wanted to
remind you of where we are in the course.

5
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.905
In week one,

6
00:00:18.905 --> 00:00:22.870
Sentil introduced you to the news
vendor problem, which is a fundamental

7
00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:27.175
operations problem of matching your
supply with uncertain future demand.

8
00:00:27.175 --> 00:00:30.680
Sentil also offered you
a look at the first steps

9
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.570
of the business analytic cycle.

10
00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.710
The problem of characterizing
data with descriptive analytics.

11
00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.230
Then in weeks two and three,
Sergei introduced predictive and

12
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.510
prescriptive tools, that are helpful
when deciding the best course of action

13
00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.778
when faced with uncertainty.

14
00:00:46.778 --> 00:00:50.930
In week two, you saw how you can use
optimization methods to find the best

15
00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.998
course of action, when there's little
uncertainty regarding the data.

16
00:00:53.998 --> 00:00:59.620
In week three, you then saw how
you can use simulation to evaluate

17
00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.730
any single course of action, when you're
faced with more significant uncertainty.

18
00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.680
And along the way,
Sergei introduced you to production and

19
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.630
distribution problems,
often faced in operations.

20
00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.610
Because of their complexity,
Sergei introduced optimization and

21
00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.140
simulation one at a time.

22
00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.540
Sometimes though you need to optimize in
settings with significant uncertainty.

23
00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.310
This is often called decision
making under uncertainty.

24
00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.400
And that's where we pick up in week four.

25
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.960
In session one, we'll begin by introducing
a new tool that provides a useful way to

26
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.920
think about and
evaluate decisions made under uncertainty.

27
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.940
They're called decision trees.

28
00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.780
Then in sessions two and three, we'll
look at how simulation, optimization, and

29
00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.710
decision trees can be used together,

30
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.880
to solve more complex problems of
decision making under uncertainty.

31
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.710
To keep the sessions focused on how
the tools can complement each other,

32
00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.820
we'll use the same example
in sessions one to three.

33
00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.010
That of a Scandinavian furniture
retailer that we call IDEA.

34
00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:02.810
Finally, in session four.

35
00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.790
We'll go back to the news vendor problem,
Sentil introduced in week one.

36
00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.970
And we'll see that we can
use the simulation and

37
00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.380
optimization framework we've
developed to tackle the problem.

38
00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.670
That's our agenda for the week.

39
00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.040
In session one, we'll introduce decision
trees, and we'll introduce them through

40
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.900
the example of IDEA,
a Scandinavian furniture retailer.

41
00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.860
IDEA plans to introduce a gazebo
tent that it calls, Krusbar.

42
00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.880
The tent's to be sold next
summer in Scandinavia, for

43
00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.680
a price that's about 150 euros.

44
00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.080
It will be manufactured in advance,
next spring and summer.

45
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.380
At that 150 euro price, there's
uncertainty regarding the demand for

46
00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:45.126
Krusbar though.

47
00:02:45.126 --> 00:02:49.160
There's a 50 50 chance that
sales will be weak or strong.

48
00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.810
If sales are strong,
IDEA will be able to sell 10,000 units.

49
00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.030
If sales are weak, IDEA will only
be able to sell 5,000 units.

50
00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.930
This demand distribution is quite simple.

51
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.510
It only has two points,
5,000 units of demand or 10,000 units.

52
00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.890
But that simplicity let's
us focus on the analysis.

53
00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.920
We'll consider more complex demand
distributions later this week.

54
00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:21.720
IDEAs considering two potential
suppliers to manufacture the Krusbar.

55
00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.410
One's in Sweden, and
the other is in Poland.

56
00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:30.200
We'll call the Swedish supplier, supplier
S and the Polish supplier, supplier P.

57
00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.880
Each of the suppliers requires that
IDEA uses all of its capacity.

58
00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.230
And IDEA will contract with at
most one of the two suppliers.

59
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.690
That is, IDEA may decide to use
supplier S, or to use supplier P,

60
00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:49.030
or IDEA may decide not to use a supplier
at all and not sell the Krusbar tent.

61
00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.360
Here are the statistics for
the two suppliers.

62
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.150
They have different capacities.

63
00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.900
You can see that supplier S has
5,000 units of capacity, and

64
00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.136
if IDEA contracts with it,
it will order 5,000 units of the tent.

65
00:04:03.136 --> 00:04:06.762
Supplier P has 10,000 units of capacit,
and

66
00:04:06.762 --> 00:04:12.085
if IDEAs contracts with it,
it will order 10,000 units of the tent.

67
00:04:12.085 --> 00:04:16.845
The two suppliers also have
different up-front charges to IDEA.

68
00:04:16.845 --> 00:04:21.170
If IDEA contracts with supplier
S there is no up-front charge.

69
00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:26.810
Where as, if IDEA contracts with Supplier
P, there's a 50,000 euro upfront charge.

70
00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.880
Unit costs are also different.

71
00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:36.190
You can see that Supplier S has a unit
cost to IDEA of 120 euros per tent.

72
00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.790
Whereas Supplier P, has a unit
cost of a hundred euros per tent.

73
00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:45.670
So, we can compare Supplier S
has no upfront charge, but

74
00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:50.870
it has a higher unit cost,
whereas Supplier P has an upfront charge,

75
00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.479
but it has a lower unit cost.

76
00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.500
We can use a decision tree
to represent IDEA's choices.

77
00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.090
Before I get in to it,
I wanna just review quickly for

78
00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.210
you, what the elements
are of a decision tree.

79
00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.070
The structures of a decision trees
made up of three building blocks.

80
00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:12.030
They're decision nodes,
which we'll represent with squares.

81
00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:15.851
Decision nodes are points at which a
decision maker has to decide on an action.

82
00:05:15.851 --> 00:05:21.122
For IDEA, those actions are which
supplier to select, if any.

83
00:05:21.122 --> 00:05:24.988
Event nodes are represented with circles.

84
00:05:24.988 --> 00:05:30.096
Event nodes are points of uncertainty
at which the outcome is random.

85
00:05:30.096 --> 00:05:34.210
For IDEA, that's whether
the market will be weak or strong.

86
00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:39.760
Finally, outcomes
are represented as triangles.

87
00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:44.340
Outcomes are payouts that occur, that are
due to specific sequences of decisions and

88
00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:45.380
events.

89
00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:48.200
For IDEA, the outcomes are its profits.

90
00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:53.130
They depend on which supplier
IDEA chooses, S, P, or none.

91
00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:57.428
And it depends on whether
the market is weak or strong.

92
00:05:57.428 --> 00:06:00.300
Now that we've defined the decision nodes,
the event nodes, and

93
00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.550
the outcomes we'll build the tree.

94
00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:07.340
The first thing that we need to do to
build the tree, is include a decision.

95
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:09.570
With whom will IDEA contract?

96
00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:13.600
If IDEA contracts with no one,
it earns no revenue and pays no costs.

97
00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.750
And you can see we have put
a cash flow of zero euros.

98
00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:19.050
And that's the end of
that part of the tree.

99
00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:23.880
The outcome for IDEA in that case,
would be to earn zero euros.

100
00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:28.040
A second possible decision would
be to contract with Supplier S.

101
00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:33.050
If IDEA contracts with Supplier S,
it pays no upfront fixed fee,

102
00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:34.610
so we've written zero euros there.

103
00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:40.880
If IDEA contracts with Supplier P however,
it will pay an upfront fixed

104
00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:45.300
fee of 50,000 euros, and you can see
we've written it on that choice as well.

105
00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:48.110
Those are the three choices that IDEA has.

106
00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:50.290
Now that we have defined
the decision node,

107
00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:54.040
the next thing that happens is an event,
whether the market is weak or strong.

108
00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:57.900
If the market is strong and

109
00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:02.690
IDEA contracts with Supplier S,
that happens with a probability of 0.5.

110
00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:06.550
In that case,
we can calculate the gross profit.

111
00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:11.420
Remember that Supplier S
has 5000 units of capacity.

112
00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:14.880
And a strong market has
10,000 units of demand.

113
00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:17.280
So IDEA would be capacity limited.

114
00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:22.370
It would sell everything that it had
ordered, and it would earn 5,000

115
00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:28.060
units times 150 euros per unit,
but pay unit costs of 120 euros

116
00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:32.610
on all 5,000 units for
a gross profit of 150,000 euros.

117
00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:37.670
That gives us an outcome
of 150 thousand euros.

118
00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:41.790
And we calculated it by
adding the zero upfront cost,

119
00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:44.310
with 150 thousand euros of gross profit.

120
00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:50.772
If on the other hand, the market is weak,
that happens with a probability of 0.05.

121
00:07:50.772 --> 00:07:54.580
And in that case, again,
we can calculate the gross profit.

122
00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:59.386
Remember, if the market's weak,
demand is only 5,000 units.

123
00:07:59.386 --> 00:08:04.690
At the same time, supplier S only
supplies 5,000 units to IDEA.

124
00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:09.300
So again, IDEA earns 150 euros per tent,

125
00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:14.140
times 5,000 tents revenue, and
it pays 120 euros per tent

126
00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:18.680
times 5,000 tents, unit cost to supplier
S for a gross profit of 150,000.

127
00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:24.520
And again, now we can calculate
the profits for IDEA's outcome,

128
00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:29.765
if it orders from supplier S and
the market is weak, it's going to earn

129
00:08:29.765 --> 00:08:34.830
150,000 euros, that's no money upfront and
150,000 euros in gross profit.

130
00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:41.710
Finally, if IDEA contracts with supplier
P, there are again, two outcomes.

131
00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:45.660
One is if the market is strong,
that happens with probability .05.

132
00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:50.722
And here the gross profit is
calculated knowing that demand

133
00:08:50.722 --> 00:08:56.600
is 10,000 units and IDEA has ordered
10,000 units from supplier P.

134
00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:01.780
So the gross profit is 10,000
units times the 150 euro revenue,

135
00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:09.600
minus 10,000 units times the 100 euro unit
cost, for a gross profit of 500,000 euros.

136
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:14.910
Now that we've got the gross profit, we
can calculate the total profits for idea.

137
00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:17.650
If it orders from supplier P and
the market is strong,

138
00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:22.390
by adding the -50,000 up
front fixed cost with

139
00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:28.030
the 500,000 euro gross profit to
get a net profit of 450,000 euros.

140
00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:33.110
If IDEA orders from supplier P and
the market is weak, that happens

141
00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:37.930
with a probability of .5, and we can
calculate these gross profits as well.

142
00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:42.080
Remember, when IDEA
orders from supplier P,

143
00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:46.300
it orders 10,000 units, but when the
market is weak, it only sells 5,000 units.

144
00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:52.480
So the gross profit is 5,000 units sold,
times 150 Euros per unit,

145
00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:57.830
minus 10,000 units ordered,
times 100 Euros per unit cost,

146
00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:01.360
for a gross profit of
negative 250,000 Euros.

147
00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:07.760
We can finally calculate this
last outcome as -300,000 Euros.

148
00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:12.649
That's the 50,000 Euro up front cost,
fixed cost,

149
00:10:12.649 --> 00:10:17.670
plus the 250,000 euro
negative gross profit.

150
00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:20.310
So that's the entire decision tree.

151
00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:21.660
Before I move on,

152
00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:26.390
I wanna point out two important facts
about the construction of decision trees.

153
00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:32.210
The first is that, to calculate
the profit for IDEA or the outcome,

154
00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:37.010
we always move from the root of the tree
all the way along the branches leading to

155
00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:42.790
an outcome, and add up all of the cash
flows associated with those branches.

156
00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:47.029
You can see for
this bottom branch it's -50,000 euros,

157
00:10:47.029 --> 00:10:53.190
minus 250,000 euros,
gives idea -300,000 euros gross profit.

158
00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:58.420
The second point that I would like to
make is that when we look at event nodes,

159
00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:02.810
we always want to make sure that the sums
of the probabilities add up to one.

160
00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:05.800
As always,
probabilities are always greater than or

161
00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:08.520
equal to zero, and
they ought to add up to one.

162
00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:14.050
Just looking at the finished tree provides
us with some interesting information.

163
00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:17.620
If IDEA contracts with no one,
it earns no revenue or

164
00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:22.100
pays no costs, and
it has a net profit of zero for certain.

165
00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:28.630
If IDEA orders from supplier S,
with a probability of 0.5,

166
00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:33.700
it earns a net profit of 150,000
euros when the market is strong.

167
00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:35.210
And with a probability of 0.5,

168
00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:40.150
it earns a net profit again of
150,000 euros when the market is weak.

169
00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:42.130
So, even though there are two outcomes and

170
00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:45.740
they're random,
both yield the same net profit.

171
00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:50.620
Finally, if IDEA orders from supplier P,
if the market's strong,

172
00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:56.050
IDEA earns a net profit of 450,000 euros,
with probably 0.5, and

173
00:11:56.050 --> 00:12:01.600
with probability 0.5 the market's weak,
and IDEA would lose 300,00 euros.

174
00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:06.170
So you can see that ordering
from supplier P has a chance of

175
00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:10.880
making the most money, but it also
has the chance of the largest loss.

176
00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:17.200
If we compare the outcomes with supplier
S or with ordering from no one,

177
00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:21.340
we can see that both provide sure profits.

178
00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:24.760
Ordering from no one provides
a sure profit of zero,

179
00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:30.073
while ordering from supplier S
provides a sure profit of 150,000.

180
00:12:30.073 --> 00:12:35.071
In that sense, looking at the tree
gives us a sense of the risk

181
00:12:35.071 --> 00:12:38.604
as [INAUDIBLE] had
defined it in week three.

182
00:12:38.604 --> 00:12:41.390
But that's just looking
at a small decision tree.

183
00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:45.430
It turns out that there
are systematic ways of evaluating

184
00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:49.120
the risks of decisions and
the rewards from decisions.

185
00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.580
And that's what we're gonna turn to next.

186
00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:55.050
There are three common approaches for
evaluating these options, and

187
00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:58.600
they bound the risk posture
of the decision maker.

188
00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:01.200
First, there's the Maxi-min strategy.

189
00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.220
What's that?

190
00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:07.120
That chooses the action always that
maximizes the minimum outcome.

191
00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:11.820
By maximizing the minimum outcome,
the decision maker is minimizing his or

192
00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:12.500
her losses.

193
00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:14.830
So that's a risk adverse strategy.

194
00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:16.400
It avoids bad outcomes.

195
00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:19.335
But notice it doesn't say
anything about good outcomes.

196
00:13:19.335 --> 00:13:22.035
It ignores the possibility
of good outcomes.

197
00:13:22.035 --> 00:13:26.745
At the other end of the spectrum,
there are maxi-max strategies.

198
00:13:26.745 --> 00:13:30.015
Those are actions that
maximize the maximum outcome.

199
00:13:31.255 --> 00:13:35.435
They seek good outcomes, but then again
they completely ignore bad outcomes.

200
00:13:35.435 --> 00:13:38.549
So those are risk seeking or
gain seeking strategies.

201
00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:45.490
In the middle are strategies that maximum
the expected values of the outcomes.

202
00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:49.450
They give equal weight to good and
bad outcomes by calculating the expected

203
00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:52.860
value, and we'll come back to
that calculation in a moment.

204
00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:57.820
There are risk neutral strategies that
lie somewhere in between the natural

205
00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:02.690
extremes of a maxi-min strategy and
maxi-max strategy.

206
00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:06.860
We can use IDEA's decision tree to
determine each of those strategies, and

207
00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:08.020
that's what we're gonna do next.

208
00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:12.970
So first,
we'll start with maxi-min strategies.

209
00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:17.420
And I wanna review for you how we're
going to determine the strategy.

210
00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:22.930
First, remember that maxi-min decisions
maximize the value of the minimum outcome.

211
00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:27.010
We'll start at the tree's outcomes and
work backwards towards it's root.

212
00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:32.750
At each event node, we'll look for
the outcome with the minimum value, and

213
00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:35.210
we'll replace that event node
with that minimum value.

214
00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:38.140
At each decision node,

215
00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:42.800
we'll choose the action that
maximizes the associated values.

216
00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:46.620
So we'll be maximizing
those minimum values.

217
00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:49.200
And we can illustrate that
using IDEA's decision tree.

218
00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:54.840
Here's the decision tree and remember
we're gonna start at the trees outcomes

219
00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:56.600
and work backwards towards its root.

220
00:14:58.050 --> 00:15:00.920
If we look at the outcomes and
start working backwards,

221
00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:04.470
we can see the first set of
things we hit are event notes.

222
00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:09.870
Remember, at each event node we wanna
find the outcome with the minimum value.

223
00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:12.130
We wanna see how bad things can get.

224
00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:15.940
If we look down at the bottom,
we can see when the market is weak or

225
00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:18.630
strong for supplier P.

226
00:15:18.630 --> 00:15:24.390
The worst outcome is when the market is
weak and the idea loses 300,000 euros.

227
00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:28.310
So we'll replace that event
node with the 300,000.

228
00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:32.400
Moving up now to supplier S,
if the market is weak or

229
00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:36.870
the market is strong,
IDEA always earns 150,000 euros.

230
00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:42.020
So, in this case, the minimum and
the maximum value are both 150,000.

231
00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:45.470
Finally, there's nothing to do
if IDEA contracts with no one.

232
00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:48.000
Because we already know
that IDEA makes no money.

233
00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:54.427
The last step of determining the maxi-min
set of decisions is to go and

234
00:15:54.427 --> 00:15:56.584
look at the decision nodes.

235
00:15:56.584 --> 00:15:58.899
Here there's one last decision node, and

236
00:15:58.899 --> 00:16:02.319
we wanna find the action that
maximizes the associated value.

237
00:16:02.319 --> 00:16:04.548
That decision's who to contract with.

238
00:16:04.548 --> 00:16:10.470
And we can see the value maximizing
decision is to contract with supplier s.

239
00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:13.370
So what we'll do is
we'll cut away those two

240
00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:18.050
little red lines that are supposed
to be cuts on branches of the tree,

241
00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:23.900
to indicate that we've chosen contracting
with supplier s as the maxi min strategy.

242
00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:29.900
The next strategy that we'll demonstrate
is the maxi-max set of decisions.

243
00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:35.850
Remember, maxi-max set of decisions
maximize the value of the maximum outcome.

244
00:16:35.850 --> 00:16:39.820
So we want to see how good we can
make the best possible outcome.

245
00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:43.200
To roll back a maxi-max decision tree,

246
00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:47.970
we again start with the tree's outcomes
and work backwards towards its root.

247
00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:52.290
At each event node, we now find
the outcome with the maximum value and

248
00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:55.170
we replace the event node
with that maximum value.

249
00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:57.500
Then at each decision node as before,

250
00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:00.770
we choose the action that
maximizes the associated value.

251
00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:05.810
So let's take a look and
see what happens with IDEAS decision tree.

252
00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:10.980
Again, we start at the tree's outcomes and
we work backwards towards its root.

253
00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:13.400
Starting at the outcomes and
moving to the left,

254
00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:16.390
we see that the first set
of nodes are event nodes.

255
00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:17.710
We'll start at the bottom.

256
00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:22.280
We'll evaluate the decision
to contract with supplier P.

257
00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:25.130
Remember, at this event node,
we going to look for

258
00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:27.190
the outcome with the maximum value.

259
00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:34.600
And for IDEA, that maximum value is
450,000 euros when the market is strong.

260
00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:36.480
So we'll replace that event node.

261
00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:38.440
And now we'll move to supplier S.

262
00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:43.220
Again, in either case,
the outcome is 150,000 euros.

263
00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:50.510
So, by contracting with supplier S,
the maximum value is 150,000 euros.

264
00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:55.870
And finally, we'll move to the decision
node, which is whom to contract with,

265
00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:59.740
and we'll choose the action that
maximizes the associated value.

266
00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:04.920
In this case, you can see
the maximum value is 450,000 euros,

267
00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:07.080
for contracting with supplier P.

268
00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:11.260
And so, we'll eliminate the other two
choices contracting with no one or

269
00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:13.160
contracting with supplier S.

270
00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:17.500
That is, the maxi-max strategy
is to contract the supplier P.

271
00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:24.240
Finally, we're going to determine what
the expected value maximizing strategy is.

272
00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:27.900
We'll start at the tree's outcomes and
work backwards towards its root.

273
00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:32.080
At each event node, we'll now calculate
the expected value of the outcomes, and

274
00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:35.090
we'll replace the event node
with that expected value.

275
00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:37.190
How do we calculate the expected value?

276
00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:39.110
We take each of the outcomes and

277
00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:43.080
we weight it by the estimate of
the probability that it will occur.

278
00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:46.750
At each decision node we'll then
choose the action that maximizes

279
00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:48.280
the associated value.

280
00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:50.880
So let's take a look at how it works for
idea.

281
00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:54.600
Again we'll start at the tree outcomes and
work backwards towards it's root.

282
00:18:55.930 --> 00:18:58.410
The first set of nodes we
see are event nodes, and

283
00:18:58.410 --> 00:19:02.670
first we'll evaluate the event
node associated with supplier P.

284
00:19:02.670 --> 00:19:05.040
And we'll calculate the expected value.

285
00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:07.980
The outcomes are four
hundred fifty thousand, and

286
00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:09.620
negative three hundred thousand.

287
00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:12.670
And we need to weight them by
the probabilities that they occur.

288
00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:13.890
Point five each.

289
00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:21.700
The calculation is that we take
.05*(450,000)+ .05*(-300,000) to

290
00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:27.540
get an expected value of 75,000 for
contracting with supplier p.

291
00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:30.560
Well take that expected value and
substitute it for

292
00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:33.830
the event node and move up to supplier s.

293
00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:38.870
The same calculation for
supplier s has 150,000 for both outcomes.

294
00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:41.440
And it's not hard to see
that when we weight both

295
00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:45.670
outcomes by 0.5 the expected
value is also 150,000.

296
00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:50.970
We'll take that expected value and
replace the event node by it.

297
00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:57.480
And finally we can decide who Idea should
contract with to maximize expected value.

298
00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:01.620
Here you can see the expected
value that highest is 150,000.

299
00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:03.880
That's contracting with supplier S.

300
00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:06.580
And so
we'll eliminate the two other options.

301
00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:12.270
The expected value maximizing strategy for
idea is to contract with supplier S.

302
00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:15.460
So those are the three strategies.

303
00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:21.000
Maximin, maximax, and
expected value maximizing strategies.

304
00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.200
The maxi-min strategy was
to chose supplier S, and

305
00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:26.950
it had a maxi-min value of 150,000 Euros.

306
00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:32.010
That is, that was the strategy that would
ensure that the worst that could happen

307
00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:35.140
would be IDEA would earn 150,000 Euros.

308
00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:38.240
The maxi-max strategy
was to chose supplier P,

309
00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:42.846
and it had a maxi-max
value of 450,000 Euros.

310
00:20:42.846 --> 00:20:46.630
The maxi-max strategy ensures

311
00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:51.076
that idea has the chance of
earning up to 450,000 euros.

312
00:20:51.076 --> 00:20:55.300
Finally the risk-neutral strategy
was to choose supplier S.

313
00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:59.068
And again,
it had an expected value of 150,000 euros.

314
00:20:59.068 --> 00:21:02.600
So you can see the maxi-min strategy and

315
00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:06.120
the risk-neutral strategy
have the same value.

316
00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:10.850
That is the expected value
maximizing strategy is also

317
00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:15.520
a very safe strategy because it's
also maximizing the minimum payout.

318
00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:19.640
We've completed the building and
the analysis of the decision tree, and

319
00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:24.530
it's a good point to review the mechanics
of what we do to analyse decision trees.

320
00:21:24.530 --> 00:21:27.300
First we construct a decision tree.

321
00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:29.160
A decision tree has three parts.

322
00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:33.850
It has decision nodes, those are points
at which you make choices among options.

323
00:21:33.850 --> 00:21:38.540
It has event nodes, those are moments in
time when there's a random occurrence.

324
00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:40.070
And finally, there are outcomes.

325
00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:44.290
They capture all the costs and rewards
leading up to each leaf of the tree.

326
00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:47.520
Having built the decision tree,
we just take a look at it.

327
00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:50.480
And looking at the range of outcomes and
the probabilities,

328
00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:52.260
itself can be instructive.

329
00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:55.130
But for a very big tree,
it's useful to have

330
00:21:55.130 --> 00:22:01.080
a more systematic way of taking
a look at the range of possibilities.

331
00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:05.330
And to do that we use three classic
decision making strategies,

332
00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:10.870
to look at risk seeking, risk avoiding and
risk neutral strategies.

333
00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:14.050
For all three of them, we started
at the end with the outcomes, and

334
00:22:14.050 --> 00:22:15.970
worked backwards to the root.

335
00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:19.990
At event notes,
we then calculated either the minimum,

336
00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:24.911
the maximum value or the expected value,
and that differed with the max/min,

337
00:22:24.911 --> 00:22:28.680
max/max, or
expected value maximizing strategy.

338
00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:29.210
And finally,

339
00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:33.140
at decision nodes, we cut away the
decision that did not maximize the value.

340
00:22:34.250 --> 00:22:39.320
This procedure identifies a range of
risk-sensitive strategies from highly risk

341
00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:45.380
avoiding max/min strategies,
to risk-seeking maxi max strategies,

342
00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:50.360
to expected value maximizing strategies
that are somewhere in between.

343
00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:54.430
When using decision trees, it's also
worth keeping the following in mind.

344
00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:58.210
The tree that we constructed in
this session was quite small.

345
00:22:58.210 --> 00:23:01.060
Specifically so
that it all could fit on one screen.

346
00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:04.050
But in real life decision trees
can be very, very large and

347
00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:07.810
have many branches and
layers of decisions and events.

348
00:23:07.810 --> 00:23:12.460
Cash flows in decision trees sometimes
stream in over long periods of time.

349
00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:17.690
Like years, In that case you need to worry
about the discounting of the cash flows.

350
00:23:17.690 --> 00:23:20.890
Where do the cash flows and probabilities
come from in the first place?

351
00:23:20.890 --> 00:23:22.610
Sometimes it comes from past data.

352
00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:27.790
For example, maybe IDEA had sold tents
similar to the Krusbar in previous years.

353
00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:29.970
Sometimes it comes from "expert judgment".

354
00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:35.070
But in either case, these are predictions
about cash flows and probabilities, and

355
00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:38.540
that's a form of "predictive" analytics
that we've touched on already in week one.

356
00:23:39.810 --> 00:23:43.080
You can even do sensitivity
analysis to address shaky data.

357
00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:47.090
For example, we might be interested
in knowing at which probability

358
00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:52.300
we become indifferent between contracting
with supplier S, and supplier P.

359
00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:54.750
Whether than saying what
the probability is,

360
00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:57.489
we find out what
the break-even probability is.

361
00:23:58.710 --> 00:24:03.160
Finally, it's easiest to use a fence
that have just a few discreet scenarios.

362
00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:04.120
That's what we did this time.

363
00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:08.060
There are only two scenarios,
a weak market and a strong market.

364
00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:10.440
But again,
the reality can be more complex.

365
00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:14.010
And that's what we're gonna look
at in session two this week.

366
00:24:14.010 --> 00:24:18.040
Finally, it's worth mentioning that
decision trees are widely used in

367
00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:19.170
practice.

368
00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:23.660
IDEA is just a small example that we've
designed to convey the essential ideas.

369
00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:24.390
But in practise,

370
00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:28.920
decision trees are used to evaluate
a really wide range of complex problems.

371
00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:32.630
And I'm gonna list just a few of them that
you can find published in Interfaces, but

372
00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:34.420
they are many many more out there.

373
00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:38.230
One example would be in research and
development licensing.

374
00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:42.790
For example, there's an interfaces article
on Phytopharm, which was deciding whether

375
00:24:42.790 --> 00:24:47.080
to keep developing its products or
to license them.

376
00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:51.290
Eventually Phytopharm was actually
bought out by another Pxharma company.

377
00:24:51.290 --> 00:24:53.440
Another nice example is credit scoring.

378
00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:58.290
There's an Interfaces article on Bank One,
which was subsequently bought by Chase.

379
00:24:58.290 --> 00:25:00.390
And when people apply for credit cards and

380
00:25:00.390 --> 00:25:04.235
other forms of credit, a common thing
to do is to use decision trees.

381
00:25:04.235 --> 00:25:09.585
Is to figure out, whether to accept
that person or to not accept the person.

382
00:25:09.585 --> 00:25:13.515
Finally, there's a nice article
on the eradication of Polio,

383
00:25:13.515 --> 00:25:17.975
in which the Center for Disease Control in
the United States is using decision trees

384
00:25:17.975 --> 00:25:20.455
to figure out what's the best
course of action is.

385
00:25:20.455 --> 00:25:24.095
There also exists different software
packages to help analyse and

386
00:25:24.095 --> 00:25:26.190
manage large decision trees.

387
00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:31.030
They range from single user products,
such as TreePlan, to massive enterprise

388
00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:35.290
wide products such as those made by
DecisionTools and Logical Decisions.

389
00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:40.030
Problems of decision making under
uncertainty are all around us.

390
00:25:40.030 --> 00:25:43.420
We find them whenever we have to
choose among competing actions, and

391
00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:45.980
our choices lead to uncertain outcomes.

392
00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:50.620
In this session, we look to the simple
one stage decision of which supplier to

393
00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:55.255
select, along with a simple model of
uncertainty in the market outcome.

394
00:25:55.255 --> 00:26:00.055
But decisions made under uncertainty can
have more complex decisions, and outcomes,

395
00:26:00.055 --> 00:26:04.525
and in the next two sessions we'll extend
our analysis to cover these cases.

396
00:26:04.525 --> 00:26:07.505
That's it for week four and
session one, see you at session two.
