00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:03.740
Welcome to Week 4's review
session on decision trees.

2
00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.390
I'm Noah Gantz your instructor for
the week.

3
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:07.330
Before we get started,

4
00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:10.430
I wanna point out that this review
session is completely optional.

5
00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.290
If the decision tree concepts we
introduced in Session 1 are clear to you,

6
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:21.010
then you can skip this review and
move onto the practice problems.

7
00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.380
After that, go ahead and
tackle week 4's homework.

8
00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.500
However, if before trying the practice
problems, you'd like an additional look

9
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.660
at how to set up and analyze a decision
tree, then join me for a review.

10
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.533
Our review is going to use
an example from patent litigation.

11
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:43.583
The two companies involved are Cellectis
and Precision BioSciences.

12
00:00:43.583 --> 00:00:48.130
Let's start with some background on
Cellectis and Precision BioSciences.

13
00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.780
Both companies developed genomic editing
technologies, that they sell for

14
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.070
use in genetic engineering.

15
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.500
In 2008,
Cellectis sued Precision BioSciences for

16
00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.680
patent infringement, and
the litigation ended in 2015.

17
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.370
Imagine now that it's 2008.

18
00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.170
Cellectis's legal advisors
note that the litigation

19
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.668
process has three well established stages.

20
00:01:10.668 --> 00:01:15.378
In stage 1, the court decides whether or
not Cellectis's patent is valid.

21
00:01:15.378 --> 00:01:18.030
In stage 2,

22
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.520
if the patent has been considered valid,
then the court will determine whether or

23
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.470
not Precision BioSciences has
infringed on select business patent.

24
00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.120
In stage 3,

25
00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:33.120
if there had been a determination
of infringement by the court, then

26
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.830
the court will determine the magnitude
of the damages payable to Cellectis.

27
00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.280
Note that if the court rules against
Cellectis, in either the first or

28
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.750
the second phase,
then the litigation ends.

29
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.780
Cellectis estimates the probabilities and

30
00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.040
the cash flows together
with it's attorneys.

31
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.790
First of all,
they estimate the probabilities of

32
00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.160
litigation advancing from
one stage to the next.

33
00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.780
They estimate that the chance of
the patent being found valid in stage 1 or

34
00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:02.740
2 and 3.

35
00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.860
So there's a 1 in 3 chance
that it won't be found valid.

36
00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.977
Then, given a valid patent,
they estimate the chances that

37
00:02:11.977 --> 00:02:17.133
Precision BioSciences will be found to
have infringed as only 1 in 4, so there's

38
00:02:17.133 --> 00:02:22.160
a 3 in 4 chance that Precision BioSciences
will be found not to have infringed.

39
00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:28.860
Finally, they estimate the possible
damage awards in phase 3 by multiplying

40
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.960
royalty percentages by the value of
Precision BioSciences contracts.

41
00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.240
And when they do the multiplication,

42
00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.790
they come out with four equally
likely damage estimates.

43
00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.481
$20 million, $30 million,
$40 million, and $50 million,

44
00:02:43.481 --> 00:02:46.320
each occurs with a probability of 1/4th.

45
00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.438
The legal team also estimates its fees for
each of the three trial stages.

46
00:02:52.438 --> 00:02:57.680
It estimates $3 million dollar charge for
the first stage, patent validity.

47
00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.520
It estimates its expenses as $5
million for the second stage,

48
00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.170
the determination of infringement.

49
00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.310
And it estimates a $1 million dollar
charge for the third stage, damages.

50
00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.260
Cellectis has the following decision
problem, when moving from one

51
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.170
stage of litigation to the next,
if Cellectis loses at that stage,

52
00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.560
it has to stop and pay its attorney's fees
up through that stage, and that's it.

53
00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:31.150
Even if Cellectis wins at that stage,
it can decide to stop litigation,

54
00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.780
and pay only its attorney's
fees up through that stage.

55
00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:40.060
More generally, Cellectis must
decide the following, whether or

56
00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.690
not to litigate in the first place.

57
00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.370
That is, whether it should
sue Precision BioSciences for

58
00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:46.720
patent infringement, or not.

59
00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.510
And if it does litigate,

60
00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.190
then after each stage it wins,
should it continue litigation, or stop?

61
00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.410
So, we want to do two things.

62
00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.212
First, we'd like to construct
a decision tree for Cellectis.

63
00:04:01.212 --> 00:04:05.968
We wanna construct the tree with decision
nodes, event nodes, and payouts.

64
00:04:05.968 --> 00:04:07.620
We also wanna write down the name and

65
00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.330
cash flows associated with
each decision and event.

66
00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.842
Next, for each event node, we wanna write
down the probabilities that they occur.

67
00:04:15.842 --> 00:04:20.650
We wanna make sure that the probabilities
at each event node add up to one.

68
00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.440
Then, for each payout,
we wanna use the revenues and

69
00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.770
costs on the branches that lead up to
the payout, to calculate its value.

70
00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.530
Having constructed the decision tree,
we then want to analyze it.

71
00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.950
We'd like to determine Cellectis's
maxi-min set of decisions.

72
00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.630
We'd then like to determine
Cellectis's maxi-max set of decisions.

73
00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.080
Finally, we'd like to
determine Cellectis's

74
00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.400
expected value maximizing
set of decisions.

75
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.810
And then we can compare the three.

76
00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:51.470
So let's get started.

77
00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.460
First we're going to construct the tree
with decision nodes, event nodes, and

78
00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:56.360
payouts.

79
00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.780
Remember that decision nodes are squares,
event nodes are circles, and

80
00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.080
outcomes or payouts are triangles.

81
00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.710
Cellectis's first decision is whether to
enter into phase one of the litigation,

82
00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:09.779
whether to litigate it at all.

83
00:05:11.082 --> 00:05:15.040
All right, and if it doesn't,
then it pays nothing.

84
00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:20.550
On the other hand, if it does, it's going
to pay its legal team $3 million dollars.

85
00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.130
Having decided to go into litigation, we

86
00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:27.580
encountered the first event node; that's
whether the patent is found valid or not.

87
00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.010
If its not found valid,
then litigation is over.

88
00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:33.620
If it is found valid,

89
00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:38.020
then Cellectis can decide whether to
proceed to phase 2 of the litigation.

90
00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:44.380
At that point, it can decide to stop, or
it can decide to proceed with phase 2, in

91
00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:48.290
which case it's going to pay its attorneys
an estimated fee of $5 million dollars.

92
00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:51.791
Having entered into phase two,

93
00:05:51.791 --> 00:05:55.265
the court will then decided whether
the patent is infringed or not.

94
00:05:56.308 --> 00:06:00.540
If it's not infringed,
then the litigation ends.

95
00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:01.980
If it is infringed,

96
00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:06.930
then Cellectis can decide whether to
proceed into phase 3 of the litigation.

97
00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:08.650
That's the damages phase.

98
00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:13.910
At that point it can decide not to, or
it can decide to proceed into the damages

99
00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:18.400
phase, and pay it's attorneys
an estimated fee of $1 million dollars.

100
00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.570
In the damages phase,
there are four equally likely outcomes.

101
00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:27.455
Cellectis might be awarded damages
of $50 million, $40 million,

102
00:06:27.455 --> 00:06:32.230
$30 million or $20 million,
so that's the full tree.

103
00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:36.580
Next, we want to decide what the
probabilities are of the different event

104
00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:40.430
nodes, so let's start at the beginning,
and work towards the end.

105
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:43.770
In the first event,
whether the patent's found valid or not,

106
00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:47.478
we know that there's a two-third chance
that the patent will be found valid.

107
00:06:47.478 --> 00:06:51.680
And a one-third chance that
the patent will not be found valid.

108
00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:54.260
So notice that those two
probabilities add up to one.

109
00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:59.630
In the second litigation phase, that's
patent infringement, we know that there's

110
00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:04.600
only a 1 in 4 chance that the patent will
be found to have been infringed upon.

111
00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.260
And that leaves a three fourths chance

112
00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.540
that the patent will not be found
to have been infringed upon.

113
00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:13.455
Again, the two probabilities
add up to one.

114
00:07:13.455 --> 00:07:18.751
In the final damages stage, there
are four equally likely outcomes of $50,

115
00:07:18.751 --> 00:07:21.035
$40, $30 and
$20 million dollars in damages.

116
00:07:21.035 --> 00:07:25.635
And each of those is going to accrue
with an equal probability, or 1 in 4.

117
00:07:25.635 --> 00:07:28.385
So those are all the probabilities
in the event nodes.

118
00:07:28.385 --> 00:07:31.000
At each event node they add up to one.

119
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.530
Finally, at each outcome we want to
determine what the payout is for

120
00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:35.330
Cellectis.

121
00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:38.140
To do that we're going to calculate
the payouts associated with

122
00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:39.070
the various outcomes.

123
00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:43.030
We're going to start at
the initial root of the tree, and

124
00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:47.620
work through all the cash flows on
the branches that lead up to the outcome.

125
00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:51.180
We start at the lower left,
in the litigation phase.

126
00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:55.624
If Cellectis decides not to litigate,
then it pays nothing to it's attorneys.

127
00:07:55.624 --> 00:07:58.628
On the other hand,
if Cellectis decides to litigate,

128
00:07:58.628 --> 00:08:01.846
it's going to pay $3 million
dollars to its attorneys.

129
00:08:01.846 --> 00:08:03.901
And then one of two things can happen.

130
00:08:03.901 --> 00:08:08.140
It could lose phase one of the litigation
in which case it would have paid three

131
00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:13.490
million and got nothing back and so the
outcome will be negative three million.

132
00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:17.840
On the other hand, it may decide to
litigate and pay the three million and

133
00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:23.240
then The patents found to be valid,
at that point Cellectis has a second

134
00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:27.970
decision, it can decide not to proceed
with these to the patent infringement.

135
00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:32.490
In which case it's paid the three
million and got nothing back, so

136
00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:36.350
again the outcome is negative
three million for Cellectis.

137
00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:41.800
Alternatively having initiated litigation
and found it's patent to be valid,

138
00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:45.850
Cellectis may decided to continue
with litigation in phase two and

139
00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:49.920
then pay an additional $5
million to it's attorneys.

140
00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:53.770
At that point,
there are two potential outcomes.

141
00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:57.390
The patent may be found to
not have been infringed upon.

142
00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:02.490
In that case, Cellectis will have paid
the $3 million plus another $5 million or

143
00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:04.186
it will have lost $8 million.

144
00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:06.435
On the other hand,

145
00:09:06.435 --> 00:09:10.210
it could be that the patent is
found to have been infringed upon.

146
00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:13.970
At which point Cellectis has yet
one more decision.

147
00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:19.970
And that is whether to engage in phase
3 of the litigation, the damages phase.

148
00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:24.130
If Cellectis having won
the patent validity and

149
00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:28.700
won the patent infringement phases
decides at that point to stop litigation,

150
00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:31.790
it will have paid $3 million and
$5 million,

151
00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:37.180
got nothing back, and
it will still have loss $8 million.

152
00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:41.980
On the other hand,
if at that point Cellectis continues with

153
00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:46.830
the damages phase, it will pay an
additional $1 million to its attorneys and

154
00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:50.180
then face one of four
equally likely outcomes.

155
00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:53.968
For example,
if the outcome is $20 million in damages,

156
00:09:53.968 --> 00:09:59.080
then Cellectis will have paid three
million and five million and one million.

157
00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:00.970
And received 20 million.

158
00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:04.880
Or it would have a net
payout of $11 million.

159
00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:09.680
That's 20 minus one,
minus five, minus three.

160
00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:11.400
If the damage is at 30 million,

161
00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:16.510
you can see that the payout would just
be ten million more or 21 million.

162
00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:21.080
If the damages are 40 million,
it would be a 31 million dollar payout.

163
00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:25.820
And, if the damages are 50 million,
it would be a 41 million dollar payout.

164
00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:28.900
So now,
we've constructed our decision tree.

165
00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:32.600
We've included decision nodes,
event modes, and outcomes.

166
00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:35.940
Along the branches we've
written the associated payout,

167
00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:38.502
the associated cash flows along the way.

168
00:10:38.502 --> 00:10:42.690
At each the event nodes we've included
probabilities that sum to one and

169
00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:47.070
we've calculated the net payout to
select this at each of the outcomes.

170
00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:52.340
We can now move on to
analyzing the decision tree.

171
00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:55.840
So now that we have
constructed a decision tree,

172
00:10:55.840 --> 00:11:01.240
we want to identify three different
sets of decision strategies.

173
00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:04.490
The first set are called
maxi-min decisions.

174
00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:09.448
Remember that these are decisions
that maximize the minimum outcomes.

175
00:11:09.448 --> 00:11:14.030
So they're a risk averse strategies and
what they're doing is they're trying to

176
00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:18.380
take the worst outcomes and make sure
the worst outcome is as good as possible.

177
00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:23.690
To do that we start at the end of the tree
and we work backwards towards it's root.

178
00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:28.200
At each event node we choose
the minimum outcome, the worst outcome.

179
00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.901
And then at each decision node,

180
00:11:30.901 --> 00:11:37.021
we choose the decision that maximizes
the outcomes of those decisions.

181
00:11:37.021 --> 00:11:37.903
So let's take a look.

182
00:11:37.903 --> 00:11:39.738
Here's our tree.

183
00:11:39.738 --> 00:11:43.734
We're gonna start up the first node
at the end is the event node so

184
00:11:43.734 --> 00:11:46.930
we're going to select
the minimum [COUGH] outcome.

185
00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:50.102
And you can see that, that's 11 million,

186
00:11:50.102 --> 00:11:54.120
we'll substitute the event
node with the 11 million.

187
00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:57.673
And now there's a decision for
Cellectis to make.

188
00:11:57.673 --> 00:12:01.380
And that is does it proceed
to phase three in litigation.

189
00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:05.095
And it's gonna choose the decision
that maximizes the outcome.

190
00:12:05.095 --> 00:12:07.650
In this case it's the 11 million.

191
00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:11.880
So yes, Cellectis is going to choose to

192
00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:14.820
enter interface re-litigation
if it makes it that far.

193
00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:19.500
And so it will choose the litigation and

194
00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:22.970
will replace the decision
node with the 11 million.

195
00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:24.860
We're back to an event node, and

196
00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:29.240
again we're going to select
the minimum event outcome.

197
00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:36.446
Here that would be if Cellectis
loses phase two of the litigation.

198
00:12:36.446 --> 00:12:41.164
That is, if the patent's determined
not to have infringed, in which case,

199
00:12:41.164 --> 00:12:44.865
it will have lost $8 million and
we'll substitute that for

200
00:12:44.865 --> 00:12:49.802
the event node and now, Cellectis has the
decision of whether to enter phase 2 or

201
00:12:49.802 --> 00:12:52.657
not, given that it made
it through phase one.

202
00:12:52.657 --> 00:12:56.636
And here you can see that
the maximum value for

203
00:12:56.636 --> 00:13:01.873
Cellectis would be not to enter
into phase 2 litigation and

204
00:13:01.873 --> 00:13:09.010
just take the $3 million loss, rather
than the chance at an $8 million loss.

205
00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:15.087
We'll substitute the $3 million loss for
the decision node.

206
00:13:15.087 --> 00:13:18.517
And we're finally at the first outcome,

207
00:13:18.517 --> 00:13:22.150
which is whether the patent is valid or
not.

208
00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:23.400
Here, in either case,

209
00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:28.290
you can see the outcome is negative $3
million, so we'll substitute that value.

210
00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:33.117
For the event node, and
now Cellectis has it's first decision,

211
00:13:33.117 --> 00:13:36.157
that is whether to enter into
litigation at all or not.

212
00:13:36.157 --> 00:13:41.170
And if it does, it will lose $3 million,
and if it doesn't, it will lose nothing.

213
00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:47.560
So to maximize the outcome,
it will choose not to go into litigation.

214
00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:52.354
And we see that Cellectis's
maxi-min strategy is

215
00:13:52.354 --> 00:13:56.039
to not to enter into litigation at all.

216
00:13:56.039 --> 00:13:59.196
The next set of strategies that we're
going to look at are maxi-max strategies.

217
00:13:59.196 --> 00:14:00.125
Those are the opposite.

218
00:14:00.125 --> 00:14:04.906
These are risk-seeking, or reward
seeking strategies that are intended to

219
00:14:04.906 --> 00:14:10.900
maximize the maximum possible outcome
without regard to how bad things can get.

220
00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:14.360
Begin, we're gonna start at the end
of the tree and work backwards.

221
00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:17.480
At each event node we're now going
to choose the maximum outcome

222
00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:21.470
rather than the minimum cuz we
wanna see how good things might be.

223
00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:27.560
Then at each decision node, selectors will
choose the outcome maximizing decision.

224
00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:29.920
And again we'll work
backwards towards the root.

225
00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:31.460
So here's the decision tree.

226
00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:35.790
We'll start at the end, and
we'll select the maximum event outcome.

227
00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:40.650
So that in this case would be 41
million and we'll substitute that for

228
00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:45.820
the event node, and now Cellectis must
decide whether to enter into phase 3,

229
00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:47.410
if it makes it that far.

230
00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:51.520
If it does, would have a maximum
outcome of 41 million.

231
00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:55.360
If it doesn't, it would have a maximum
outcome of negative eight million.

232
00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:59.770
So it's going to choose
to enter into phase 3.

233
00:14:59.770 --> 00:15:02.600
We're going to substitute
the 41 million for

234
00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:06.310
the decision node, and
now we're back to an event node.

235
00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:12.040
Whether the patent was infringed or
not in phase 2.

236
00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:17.369
And here, you can see the maximum outcome,
again would be $41 million.

237
00:15:17.369 --> 00:15:21.450
So we'll substitute that for
the event node.

238
00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:25.740
That's as good as things could get for
Cellectis.

239
00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:28.590
And now Cellectis has a decision of

240
00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:32.770
whether to enter into phase
2 if it makes it that far.

241
00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:38.110
And you can see again that
if it makes it that far,

242
00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:41.720
if it enters into phase 2 it
can earn up to 41 million.

243
00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:47.480
And if it decides to stop at that point,
it would lose 3 millions.

244
00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:53.760
So, again, the value maximizing decision
would be to enter into litigation.

245
00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:59.283
And so we'll take that $41 million and
we'll substitute it for the decision node.

246
00:15:59.283 --> 00:16:04.895
And, here, we're at the outcome of
the event of the Phase one of the trail,

247
00:16:04.895 --> 00:16:08.595
determining whether the patent's valid or
not.

248
00:16:08.595 --> 00:16:12.745
Again, we're going to select
the maximum event outcome,

249
00:16:12.745 --> 00:16:17.975
which is $41 million, substitute it for
the event node, and finally,

250
00:16:17.975 --> 00:16:23.630
Cellectis has a decision of whether
to enter into litigation at all.

251
00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:25.830
If it does enter into litigation,

252
00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:28.990
it would have the chance of
earning up to $41 million.

253
00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:31.950
If it doesn't,
its gonna have the chance of earning zero.

254
00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:36.150
So Cellectis in this case would
choose to enter into litigation.

255
00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:39.220
And we see that to maximize
its maximum payout,

256
00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:42.550
Cellectis should proceed through
all stages of litigation.

257
00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:45.560
That's the only way it can
earn a positive payout.

258
00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:50.019
And it has the chance of running up to
$41 million, if things work out for it.

259
00:16:50.019 --> 00:16:55.071
[COUGH] So
we've seen the maxi-min set of decisions,

260
00:16:55.071 --> 00:17:01.850
maximizing the minimum outcome is to
not enter into litigation at all.

261
00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:05.422
And really,
at any stage of the litigation, to stop.

262
00:17:05.422 --> 00:17:11.160
The maxi-max set of decisions to maximize
the maximum possible outcome, would be to

263
00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:16.200
proceed through all stages of litigation
to have a chance at that $41 million.

264
00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:21.351
Finally, we're going to look at
the expected value maximizing decision for

265
00:17:21.351 --> 00:17:22.470
Cellectus.

266
00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:27.760
Those are the risk neutral decisions
that place equal weight on good and

267
00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:29.010
bad outcomes.

268
00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:32.220
As before, we're going to start
with the tree's outcomes and

269
00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:34.120
work backwards to its root.

270
00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:37.630
At each event node, we're gonna calculate
the expected value of the outcome.

271
00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:40.010
So that's the weighted
average of the outcomes.

272
00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:43.360
We'll use the probabilities
as the weights.

273
00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:47.710
At each decision node, then, we'll choose
the expected value maximizing decision.

274
00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:50.110
So here we go again.

275
00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:54.800
We're gonna start at the end, and we'll
calculate the expected value of phase

276
00:17:54.800 --> 00:18:00.179
three of the trial where
we'll equally weight the $41,

277
00:18:00.179 --> 00:18:02.740
$31, $21, and $11 million outcomes.

278
00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:06.220
And when we calculate the expected value,
it's $26 million.

279
00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:09.910
And we'll substitute that for
the event node.

280
00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:14.550
So now, Cellectis must decide whether
to enter into phase three litigation,

281
00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:16.320
given that it made it that far.

282
00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:18.697
If it does,
the expected value is $26 million,

283
00:18:18.697 --> 00:18:20.480
if it doesn't it's negative eight.

284
00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:25.306
So Cellectis is going to choose to
continue litigation if it makes

285
00:18:25.306 --> 00:18:26.810
it that far.

286
00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:30.510
And we'll substitute the $26 million for
the decision node.

287
00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:34.810
Again, we have an event node and
we're gonna calculate the expected value

288
00:18:34.810 --> 00:18:39.639
of the two events which
would be if it wins phase 2,

289
00:18:39.639 --> 00:18:43.730
ten the expected value from then
on out would be $26 million.

290
00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:46.442
If it loses phase 2, then the expected
value is negative $8 million.

291
00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:51.837
So we'll calculate according to those
probabilities of one-fourth and

292
00:18:51.837 --> 00:18:55.030
three-fourths, the expected
value of the two outcomes, and

293
00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:56.840
it's just a half a million.

294
00:18:56.840 --> 00:19:02.410
We'll substitute the half a million in for
the event node and now Cellectis

295
00:19:02.410 --> 00:19:07.510
needs to decide if it makes it to phase 2,
should it enter into phase 2 litigation.

296
00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:11.470
If it does, the expected value's
a half a million, if it doesn't,

297
00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:13.640
the expected value is negative $3 million.

298
00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:17.850
So we'll decide, should it make it
to phase 2 to enter into litigation?

299
00:19:17.850 --> 00:19:20.560
And we'll substitute the half million for
the decision node.

300
00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:25.360
The last event is whether

301
00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:30.220
Cellectis's patent will have
been decided to be valid or not.

302
00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:35.330
And here, Cellectis needs to calculate
the expected value of the two outcomes.

303
00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:38.400
If the patent's valid,
then the expected value for

304
00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:42.620
Cellectis is a half million, if it is
invalid, it is negative $3 million.

305
00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:47.296
And when we take the expected value across
those two outcomes, with two thirds and

306
00:19:47.296 --> 00:19:52.540
one third probabilities, the expected
value is negative $0.67 million.

307
00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:57.013
Will substitute the negative
$0.67 million for the event node,

308
00:19:57.013 --> 00:20:01.959
and select this as first decision as
whether to enter into litigation at all.

309
00:20:01.959 --> 00:20:07.143
If Cellectis does enter into litigation,
its expected value is negative

310
00:20:07.143 --> 00:20:11.839
$0.67 million and
if it doesn't the expected value is $0.

311
00:20:11.839 --> 00:20:16.556
In choosing to maximize the expected
value Cellectis would choose to not

312
00:20:16.556 --> 00:20:19.425
enter into litigation at all.

313
00:20:19.425 --> 00:20:22.335
And so, to maximize its expected value

314
00:20:22.335 --> 00:20:25.310
Cellectis again would not
enter into litigation.

315
00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:30.845
That's the same initial strategy
as the risk minimizing,

316
00:20:30.845 --> 00:20:33.910
maxi/min strategy,
not to enter into litigation.

317
00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:37.030
So what have we seen?

318
00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:39.040
We built a decision tree.

319
00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:42.450
We used decision nodes,
event nodes and outcomes.

320
00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:46.500
We made sure that the probabilities
that each of the event nodes sum to one.

321
00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:49.810
We added up the cash flows
from the roots of the tree

322
00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:53.940
to each leaf to calculate
the appropriate pad at each leaf.

323
00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:56.940
We then identified three strategies.

324
00:20:56.940 --> 00:21:00.740
The maxi-min,
which is the risk minimizing strategy.

325
00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:04.400
The maxi-max,
which is the reward maximizing strategy.

326
00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:07.870
And the expected value maxing strategy,
which is risk neutral.

327
00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:09.925
We saw that the initial maxi-min and

328
00:21:09.925 --> 00:21:13.110
expected-value maximizing
decisions coincided.

329
00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:17.640
In both cases, it was optimal not to
litigate and to collect no money.

330
00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:20.250
The maxi-max strategy differed however.

331
00:21:20.250 --> 00:21:22.320
To have a chance at collecting damages,

332
00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:25.520
it had to continue through
all stages of litigation.

333
00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:27.327
So, that's it for our review problem.

334
00:21:27.327 --> 00:21:30.466
Now that you've got it under your belt,
it's time for you to go and

335
00:21:30.466 --> 00:21:33.509
work a couple of practice problems
in preparation for the quiz.

336
00:21:33.509 --> 00:21:34.860
Thanks.
