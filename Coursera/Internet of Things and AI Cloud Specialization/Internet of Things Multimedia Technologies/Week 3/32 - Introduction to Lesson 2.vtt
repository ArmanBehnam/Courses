00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.710
Welcome everyone to Lesson
2 of your Multimedia course

2
00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.470
on the specialization of
Internet of Things here at UCST.

3
00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:14.790
And, now we are going to start talking
to you about Simple CV and Open CV.

4
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.130
>> Yeah, these are going to be the two
main libraries that we'll be using to

5
00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.270
create our Computer Vision application.

6
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.685
And the first thing we'll do,

7
00:00:22.685 --> 00:00:26.558
is talk about what's the differences and
similarities between Open and SimpleCV.

8
00:00:26.558 --> 00:00:28.571
>> Absolutely, yeah, so
Randy's going to kind of break it down,

9
00:00:28.571 --> 00:00:31.218
give you a few of the characteristics,
some of the important things about them.

10
00:00:31.218 --> 00:00:35.196
And then we are going to
boot your Dragon Board up,

11
00:00:35.196 --> 00:00:39.670
we are going to get it ready
to build your applications.

12
00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.279
>> Yeah.
>> So we're going to actually pull those

13
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.410
libraries over.

14
00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.630
>> Yeah, it'll probably be long and

15
00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.780
you want to try out the building
an application in Linux.

16
00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.550
Go ahead, set your board up with Linux.

17
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.240
>> Yeah, go to 96Boards,
download the newest Linux image,

18
00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.810
put it on an SD card or
you can do it through fast boot.

19
00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:59.930
If you like, follow the instructions.

20
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:01.455
You can go back to our second course.

21
00:01:01.455 --> 00:01:03.108
>> Yeah.
>> Where we show you how to flash on

22
00:01:03.108 --> 00:01:04.385
the operating systems or

23
00:01:04.385 --> 00:01:08.177
they have plenty of documentation
there on the website 96ports.org.

24
00:01:08.177 --> 00:01:12.738
And get your Dragon Board running on Linux
so you can be ready to follow us now.

25
00:01:12.738 --> 00:01:13.658
>> Yep.

26
00:01:13.658 --> 00:01:14.410
>> See you in the next videos.
