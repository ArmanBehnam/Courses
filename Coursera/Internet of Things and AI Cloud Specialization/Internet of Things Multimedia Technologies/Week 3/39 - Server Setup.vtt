WEBVTT

1
00:00:03.302 --> 00:00:07.946
At this point I just want to give a little
recap before we've kind of gone through so

2
00:00:07.946 --> 00:00:12.820
far to lead up to ultimately what you
see up there, the Server Setup, right?

3
00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:19.115
So we took you through the application and
at very basic level.

4
00:00:19.115 --> 00:00:19.880
>> Mm-hm.
>> Right,

5
00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.780
we just showed it taking a picture
>> Using all the libraries you

6
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.050
pulled in and a small script, and

7
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.380
then we added a bunch of effects
that were provided by SimpleCV.

8
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.200
>> Yeah.

9
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.800
>> So we just got to kind of use those
functions and show that we can, you know,

10
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.510
apply a gray scale, put little green boxes
around faces with facial recognition,

11
00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.290
and was it the contour, right?

12
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.950
>> Yeah.
>> So really cool stuff.

13
00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:51.190
Now, what we want to do is we
want to provide you remote access

14
00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:52.690
to these images, right?

15
00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.160
Because you might not be home or
you might not be exactly

16
00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.480
right by your camera with hard
access to the Dragon Board 410C.

17
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.660
So, in order to do that, we want to
show you how to build a server, and

18
00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:10.740
we did this on Android a couple times,
but we want to do it on Linux.

19
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:11.860
>> With the help of Python.

20
00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.080
>> Yeah, with the help of Python.

21
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.610
So, Randy's going to kind of walk
you through all this, right?

22
00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:16.120
>> Yeah.
Right.

23
00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.970
>> Okay.
>> Go ahead and

24
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:18.820
take a look at your
Dragon Board right now.

25
00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.250
>> Dive right into
the Dragon Board screen.

26
00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.730
>> So the first thing I want to
mention is earlier we had the

27
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:24.980
>> Pictures all in desktop, but

28
00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.760
I went ahead and moved everything into
the Pictures folder right here, so

29
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.020
let's open up, we have our four
images just like last time.

30
00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.560
So, the first thing is pretty simple.

31
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.610
What you want to do is CD right into
the picture directory, so it'll be here,

32
00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:49.520
and if we do a quick LS, we can see all of
our pictures right here, and then python.

33
00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.220
Since we've already installed everything,
all the python libraries and stuff,

34
00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:55.340
we don't need to do anything extra.

35
00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.760
We'll just type python -m.

36
00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.920
The dash m makes it so

37
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.700
your website will only show the things
in this current directory, so

38
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.790
it doesn't have to see every
single file on your dragon board.

39
00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:14.970
Python SimpleHTTPServer, and

40
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.240
the number following
this would be a port that

41
00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.580
will be connected to this
to see all these files.

42
00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.740
So just enter, and then there you go.

43
00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:28.610
It has, it's serving.

44
00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.770
So let's just check it out
on the Dragon Board itself.

45
00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:32.970
If we open the web browser.

46
00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.170
Let's see here.

47
00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:40.340
>> Did you click?

48
00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:44.400
There you go.

49
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.960
>> Yeah.
So

50
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.810
if we typed in, oop, 0.0.0.0, Colon 8080.

51
00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.680
There we go.

52
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.660
>> How about that.

53
00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.380
>> So we see that all these
things are kicked in right now.

54
00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.560
Just going to click on this.

55
00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.170
There we go.

56
00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.910
>> That was images.

57
00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:00.410
>> That was images.
>> Nice.

58
00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:01.631
>> So we can see them on the Dragon Board.

59
00:03:03.867 --> 00:03:08.480
>> So, he's accessing it from
the Dragon Board, right?

60
00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.950
>> Yeah.
>> But as long as you're connected to

61
00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:10.800
the network.

62
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:11.400
>> Yeah.

63
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.440
You should be able to that too.

64
00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.370
>> Should be able to see it.

65
00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.040
So then, yeah, real quick,
to access it from say a computer, right,

66
00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.010
or yeah, a computer, so remote.

67
00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.700
I need to cancel this really quick,
so Ctrl+C this, and

68
00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:33.296
then we're going to need to do
something called /sbin/ifconfig

69
00:03:33.296 --> 00:03:37.834
,and right here we can
see under your wlan0.

70
00:03:37.834 --> 00:03:43.520
>> [LAUGH]
>> We can see your IP right here.

71
00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:48.668
So we're going to save that somewhere,
so we'll just type it in.

72
00:03:48.668 --> 00:03:52.045
172.20.10.7.

73
00:03:52.045 --> 00:03:53.480
Cool, and now,

74
00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.670
we run again the server one more time,
and we'll take a look at it in my laptop.

75
00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.530
>> So now, we're going to do is we're
going to actually access the same thing we

76
00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.440
just access, but, from a remote
>> Yeah.

77
00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.510
>> Location.

78
00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.360
No longer hardwired into the-
>> Right.

79
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.176
So we just type in 172.20
>> Remotely.

80
00:04:12.176 --> 00:04:15.317
.10.78080.

81
00:04:15.317 --> 00:04:17.760
Let's see here.

82
00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.020
Sweet, there it is.

83
00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:22.500
>> All right, so the exact same directory
that you saw on your Dragon Board.

84
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.182
Hey, look at that.
Look at those good looking guys.

85
00:04:25.182 --> 00:04:30.719
>> [LAUGH] Servicing disk crashed.

86
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:33.980
Did it crush on the Dragon board?

87
00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:35.000
>> No. There you go. >> All right.

88
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Cool.
>> Sometimes it might lag.

89
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.290
Maybe there's a little hiccup.

90
00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:38.360
That's pretty normal now.

91
00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.800
>> I mean, there's a lot of interference.

92
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.590
>> Unfortunately.

93
00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:43.960
>> There you go.
All right.

94
00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:44.760
Cool.
>> Yeah.

95
00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:45.410
>> That's good.

96
00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:46.390
>> Yup.

97
00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:49.420
So, that's a pretty cool very,
extremely simple server.

98
00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:56.650
Which just a quick Where
do they say all your files?

99
00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.250
So, a cool thing we can do is

100
00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:05.470
make your camera continually take shots,
and that's what exciting, right?

101
00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:06.320
>> Yeah, so.
>> because, I mean,

102
00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.260
what if you want to monitor what's
happening around your house.

103
00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.430
You don't want to use up
too much storage either,

104
00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.320
you just want to kind of take a shot
every three seconds, or something.

105
00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.520
>> So, maybe
>> Like this image right now, and

106
00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:21.110
then a couple minutes later, it changes
because the camera just took a new shot.

107
00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.890
So I'll go a ahead and show you how to
do that right now on the drawing board.

108
00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:26.250
>> Alright, so let's switch over
back to the Dragon Board screen.

109
00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.880
See what's the, see how we can do this.

110
00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:29.990
>> Yep.

111
00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:34.790
Alright, we can go ahead and, oops.

112
00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:41.550
We'll go ahead and cancel this server,
and we'll go back.

113
00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:42.310
No.
We don't need to go back.

114
00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:46.760
We'll be using something called cron tab.

115
00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.960
It's a little tool I've
shown a while back.

116
00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:56.020
So to get it, you do, you'll just
issue can sudo apt-get install cron.

117
00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.280
Now, we already have this so
we won't need to do it, but

118
00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:00.970
you guys will need to
install it really quick.

119
00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:05.260
Give it a second to download,
install, and after it finishes,

120
00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:09.630
go ahead and type in crontab -e.

121
00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:13.190
This is,
we're editing your crontab script.

122
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.680
Now on your first launch,
it'll ask you Illifrent Editor,

123
00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.260
because cointab needs to be edited,
somehow.

124
00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.680
So, we're going to just use VMBasic,
so we'll hit 1 right here.

125
00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:26.110
Enter, cool.

126
00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:26.900
Everything is right here.

127
00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:27.890
Go all the way to the bottom.

128
00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:32.730
We'll go ahead and put in our command.

129
00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:37.360
So, what cointab basically does,
is it will continuously repeat.

130
00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.510
>> A command line command for

131
00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:43.810
you, and the syntax is basically
right here, as you can see.

132
00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:45.850
Let me use a mouse right here.

133
00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:52.530
It's minute, hour, day of the month,
the month, and the day of the week.

134
00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:55.220
Now, that might be a bit
confusing at first, but

135
00:06:55.220 --> 00:07:00.520
you guys can just Simply look up and check
out the documentation they have on it.

136
00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:03.230
So, for us, we're going to
need the lowest time setting.

137
00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:04.562
>> Maybe that'll be a quiz question.

138
00:07:04.562 --> 00:07:05.140
>> Yeah.
>> [LAUGH]

139
00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:05.740
>> It will.

140
00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:06.960
Make sure you look it up.

141
00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:10.180
So we'll have the camera
taking shots every minute.

142
00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:15.600
So we do just a * * * * and
* for every minute, every hours.

143
00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:19.540
>> Wait, why don't we have it do it
like every, can you not do seconds?

144
00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:22.710
>> Yeah, actually on content we can't
do anything less than seconds, but

145
00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:25.960
I have a pretty neat workaround,
I'll show you in a sec.

146
00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:27.930
>> Do you do like minute divided 60.

147
00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:30.800
[LAUGH]
>> That means if you do a star divided by

148
00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.430
60, it means every minute
is divisible by 60, so.

149
00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:38.350
>> Gotcha
>> All right so then too Yeah since

150
00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:45.246
Quintab is in a different directly
you'll have to use the entire file path.

151
00:07:45.246 --> 00:07:52.877
So we'll do /user/bin/python to
run Python and then we have our

152
00:07:54.755 --> 00:07:59.944
Our code in the CV Project,

153
00:07:59.944 --> 00:08:06.490
so home/linaro/Desktop/CV\

154
00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:14.183
Project/ I believe it was Basic CV App?

155
00:08:14.183 --> 00:08:20.155
Double check that, like, yep.

156
00:08:20.155 --> 00:08:25.040
Okay, BasicCVApp.py.

157
00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:28.550
So that'll be a line telling it to
execute this script every minute.

158
00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:33.050
So work around is so if we can do every
media again, but will do type in say 30 so

159
00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:37.600
sleeps for 30 seconds, so
that makes it run every 30 seconds

160
00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:38.440
>> After the first minute.

161
00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:43.970
Yeah so after a minute it will run this
very top line it will run both of this,

162
00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:45.800
but it will run this,
and wait 30 seconds and

163
00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:50.680
it will run the next time
>> So this is the way to get yourself

164
00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:53.918
to be able to take pictures say, every 15
seconds or something if you wanted to.

165
00:08:53.918 --> 00:09:01.786
Desktop, CV,
Project/BasicCVApp.py Awesome,

166
00:09:01.786 --> 00:09:07.026
so we just go ahead, save and quit,

167
00:09:07.026 --> 00:09:13.580
and now it says installing new crontab.

168
00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:16.555
So, every minute now we should
be able to take new pictures.

169
00:09:20.047 --> 00:09:25.024
>> Yeah, so this is just showing you that
crontab is taking these pictures and

170
00:09:25.024 --> 00:09:28.658
we still haven't access them
through the server, but

171
00:09:28.658 --> 00:09:31.440
we showed you that we can access them now.

172
00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:35.250
There you go.
See if we can get a picture.

173
00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:39.370
So every minute, and then after that when
it turns into 30 seconds, 15 seconds.

174
00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:40.350
>> Every 30 seconds.

175
00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:43.060
>> There you go.
So now it's just doing this automatically.

176
00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:44.630
>> So I'm not going to do anything, and

177
00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:48.470
then we go ahead, and actually I'll go
ahead and run the server again so let's.

178
00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:51.520
>> Yeah, so now what we're going to do
is we're going to run the server, and

179
00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:58.910
we're going to access the pictures as they
are taken, every x amount of seconds.

180
00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:03.490
>> Let's look at you.

181
00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:04.030
Look at it.

182
00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:05.970
[LAUGH]
>> [LAUGH] The camera taking a picture of

183
00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:06.673
the camera.

184
00:10:06.673 --> 00:10:10.730
>> [LAUGH]
>> With the TV in the background.

185
00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:14.860
>> So yeah, as you can see, so
this is the browser with the IP,

186
00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:19.635
and then you can obviously check it
out on your laptop again as well.

187
00:10:19.635 --> 00:10:24.583
[LAUGH] All you need to do
is refresh the page, and

188
00:10:24.583 --> 00:10:28.314
then it'll upload the new images.

189
00:10:30.717 --> 00:10:32.810
Cool.
>> That's it, yeah.

190
00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:33.500
>> That's about it?

191
00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:34.480
>> Yeah, that's about it.

192
00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:35.630
>> Let's show them one more time though.

193
00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:40.440
Let's access them through
the browser on the Mac.

194
00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:42.370
So we're going to switch over to the Mac,
and

195
00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:44.380
we just want to access these
pictures one more time.

196
00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:46.580
So it's going to still be running, right?

197
00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:47.080
>> All right.

198
00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:50.580
That's an old one.

199
00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:52.740
So this is a problem
you might have as well.

200
00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:59.020
So, we have the webpage running
on the Dragon Board, but

201
00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:00.190
for some reason it's not working.

202
00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:03.730
So, this is easily solved
by going ahead and

203
00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:07.040
launching another instance of your
terminal in the Dragon Board, Well,

204
00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:10.870
looks like we're switching
back to the Dragon Board.

205
00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:13.120
>> Yeah.
And then we'll type in sudo ping, and

206
00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:18.240
then you'll need to find out
the IP address of your system,

207
00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:22.960
so that could be through
your wireless settings or

208
00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:25.770
anything like that, but mine is 172.20.10.

209
00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:32.110
Put 4 and we just give it a sec and
this is initiating

210
00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:38.050
issue in it by pinging your
laptop to the drawing board.

211
00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:43.290
Your laptop will be able to recognize
that the Dragon Board's actual server.

212
00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:45.750
So there we go.
So it's pinging, which we cancel this.

213
00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:46.480
>> So now we cancel it and

214
00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:47.500
we switch back to the
>> Yeah,

215
00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:48.760
switch back to the
>> To the Mac

216
00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:50.810
>> To the computer.

217
00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:51.780
Let's refresh this.

218
00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:53.290
Everything is there.

219
00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.120
So let's check it out.

220
00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:57.710
It's you.

221
00:11:57.710 --> 00:11:58.490
>> Man.
>> [LAUGH] It's you.

222
00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:00.410
You forgot it takes pictures
every 30 seconds, right?

223
00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:01.150
>> Yeah.

224
00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:03.390
So there we are.
>> All right, so it's just.

225
00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:03.970
>> What's going on?

226
00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:06.660
What happened?

227
00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:07.910
>> So only that one got refreshed.

228
00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:11.310
>> All right, so
you can see we PNGed the server.

229
00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:13.450
We were having a little glitch there.

230
00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:18.640
Sometimes it stops recognizing it and
thinks that it's unreachable, but.

231
00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:23.190
So once you PNG it, and
then you You kind of re-activate it, so

232
00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:27.080
to say, and
now we can go back to the Mac, and

233
00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:31.970
what we're going to do is we're going
to show that what we're doing is,

234
00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:38.250
the whole plan is to take a picture
every X amount of seconds,

235
00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:43.940
and then have access to those pictures
that are being taken on a remote computer.

236
00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:46.260
So, let's go back to the remote
computer and just show kind of,

237
00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:47.470
like I think one was taken
>> Yeah.

238
00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:49.670
>> right beside a green light flash.

239
00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:50.610
So, there you go.

240
00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:52.130
While I was talking to you
>> Yeah.

241
00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:55.950
>> That was taken, and now, let's just
show one more is going to be taken,

242
00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.220
and let's just show a pop up on the.

243
00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:01.670
I'll tell you when the green
light flashes here.

244
00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:02.170
>> Yeah.

245
00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:04.480
So remember,
we talked about facial recognition.

246
00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:06.857
This is the facial recognition picture.

247
00:13:06.857 --> 00:13:11.070
It isn't always, it depends on
what kind of XML value you use.

248
00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:14.490
So, ours is,
we're using the parental phase one.

249
00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:17.560
So as you see, we're missing
bunch of No facial features so

250
00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:18.970
it won't be able to see us.

251
00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:20.310
>> So just took another picture right now,

252
00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:24.570
so, give it a second it should send it
over and we should be able to access.

253
00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:25.810
So there you go, the picture changes.

254
00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:29.070
>> There you go [LAUGH]
>> Now I just want to, you know for fun,

255
00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:30.258
show you one more here.

256
00:13:30.258 --> 00:13:34.480
Let's see if we can get a little picture
of you guys looking at the camera here.

257
00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:37.640
So, one last One last picture.

258
00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:43.700
Should show up, maybe, in like five
more seconds, ten more seconds.

259
00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:45.310
Let's see, it's every thirty seconds.

260
00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:46.960
>> I wasn't counting.

261
00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:49.740
>> Yeah, so, anyways, hopefully,

262
00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:53.820
you all had fun building this thing, and
as you can imagine, we're just going to

263
00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:57.040
keep refreshing this because we can't see
the green light, it's pointed at you guys.

264
00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:00.910
Point it at the camera, but
hopefully you had fun building this,

265
00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:04.780
and I hope you understand how
powerful all of this stuff is.

266
00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:08.330
All the way from the characteristics
that we were talking about,

267
00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:11.980
the characteristics that we
talked about in lesson 1,

268
00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:16.110
when we were talking about supplementals,
and concepts, and all of that stuff.

269
00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:21.740
All the way until Getting to, there you
go, all right, so the picture changed.

270
00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:26.410
All the way to showing you actually
executing these very powerful libraries

271
00:14:26.410 --> 00:14:31.660
and using just a USB camera
on your DragonBoard 410c

272
00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:38.570
to create very cool applications,
and I hope that you use this for.

273
00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:40.620
For some really cool stuff.

274
00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:42.330
Yeah, absolutely.

275
00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:43.744
>> That about wraps it up right?

276
00:14:43.744 --> 00:14:47.970
>> Yeah, that about wraps it up so
we'll see you in the next video.

277
00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:53.160
Please check out the discretions and
what all of your fellow students and

278
00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:56.780
classmates are doing for cool stuff.

279
00:14:56.780 --> 00:15:02.090
I'm with multimedia projects like this,
but see you in the next summary video.
