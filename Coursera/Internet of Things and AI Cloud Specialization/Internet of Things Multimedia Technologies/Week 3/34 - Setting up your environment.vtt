1
00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.340
So it's finally time to
dive into the DragonBoard

2
00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:09.100
where we will begin our setup for the
application that we're going to be making.

3
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.680
>> Yep, so, let's go ahead and
check it out.

4
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.770
>> It's time.
>> Yep, so over here we'll,

5
00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:19.820
this is the first thing you will see
when you load up your Linux boot for

6
00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.110
the first time.

7
00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:22.863
And then what we're
going to do is go ahead and

8
00:00:22.863 --> 00:00:25.550
go, make sure you connect to the Internet.

9
00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.470
>> Good idea.
>> Yeah, so we're already there.

10
00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:33.730
And then we'll go ahead, go down here into
System Tools and into the LX Terminal.

11
00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.370
The first thing I like to do
when the terminal launches

12
00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.100
is to increase the font size because
it tends to be too small for me.

13
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.329
Let's see, it's in the preferences.

14
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:51.100
Here we go.
Let's try, Let's see, 20.

15
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.820
Okay, all right, looking much better.

16
00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.010
So, now that we have that-
>> Is that font big enough, you think?

17
00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.330
>> Yeah, looks good.

18
00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:03.410
>> That should be good.

19
00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:04.100
>> Yeah.

20
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.880
>> I can mute it.
Fine.

21
00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:05.650
All right.

22
00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.150
So now we have the terminal set up.

23
00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.840
We'll go ahead and
start by doing sudo apt get update.

24
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:18.630
This one will update all your
system files and everything because

25
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.660
it's not quite up to date with the latest-
>> Yeah,

26
00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.700
we went through this a couple
times I think in course two.

27
00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.842
So hopefully your board is up to date, but

28
00:01:29.842 --> 00:01:32.600
I mean,
this is quite a while after course two.

29
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.700
You should be performing these updates,
upgrades every now and then.

30
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.494
>> Yeah, and don't forget,

31
00:01:40.494 --> 00:01:47.050
we'll provide the slide with every single
command you'll need to set up your board.

32
00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.750
And if you did forget how do set up
Linux on your board, go ahead and

33
00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.014
check out course two module four,
where we talked about changing your OS.

34
00:01:57.672 --> 00:01:59.260
>> It's almost done, right?

35
00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.268
>> Yeah.
[LAUGH] And we'll go ahead and

36
00:02:01.268 --> 00:02:04.310
probably fast forward
through these slow sections.

37
00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:09.964
The next thing after the update finishes,

38
00:02:09.964 --> 00:02:14.240
we'll do sudo apt get upgrade, Enter.

39
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.470
And then I'll just upgrade everything for
us, similar to update.

40
00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.960
>> Go ahead and hit Y.

41
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.370
>> Yeah, hit Y,
make sure to let it do its thing.

42
00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:23.760
So you can see it counting
the percentage there.

43
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.010
We're going to fast forward this again and
we'll get back to you when it's at 100%.

44
00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.810
>> All right,
now that the sudo apt-get upgrade is done,

45
00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.410
we'll go ahead and
install the necessary Python libraries.

46
00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.280
Now it's going to be
a pretty huge command, but

47
00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.960
you guys can find it on the slides or
just type it in one by one.

48
00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:42.486
So here we go.

49
00:02:42.486 --> 00:02:49.630
sudo apt get install,
first one is ipython, and

50
00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:55.060
then we want python-opencv
because SimpleCV uses OpenCV.

51
00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.525
Then we have python,

52
00:02:59.525 --> 00:03:05.480
scipy python, let's see,

53
00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.954
num, oops, numpy.

54
00:03:09.954 --> 00:03:15.825
Then we have python pygame python

55
00:03:15.825 --> 00:03:22.750
setuptools python pip and python dev.

56
00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.720
Here we go.

57
00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.340
And those should be all
the necessary Python tools.

58
00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.330
Go ahead and hit yes, or Y for yes.

59
00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.030
Enter, and we'll go ahead and wait for

60
00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.220
it to finish installing, downloading,
and go ahead and fast forward this part.

61
00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.660
And we'll meet you back when we
do the next set of commands.

62
00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.488
All right, after the photo files.

63
00:03:50.488 --> 00:03:52.810
>> Here you got all those libraries down,
yeah, so now it's time for Pillow.

64
00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.096
>> We'll do sudo pip install Pillow.

65
00:03:58.777 --> 00:04:03.864
And then this will use
the Python Python install tool

66
00:04:03.864 --> 00:04:09.643
we just installed, or
got a while back a couple steps ago and

67
00:04:09.643 --> 00:04:16.220
install the Pillow library that
we need to use the SimpleCV.

68
00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.590
So I'll take a second
to install everything.

69
00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:20.650
>> Perfect.
>> Okay, so

70
00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.700
now that Pillow is installed we're
finally ready to get SimpleCV.

71
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:30.440
So we'll go ahead and do git clone

72
00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:39.551
https://github.com/sightmachine/SimpleCV.-

73
00:04:39.551 --> 00:04:41.313
git.

74
00:04:41.313 --> 00:04:45.843
And this will clone the repository
that as the other simple

75
00:04:45.843 --> 00:04:50.830
CV stuff that we'll need
to begin using the library.

76
00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.530
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah, so you just wait for

77
00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.890
it to quickly download.

78
00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:00.750
Okay, now that we have the SimpleCV

79
00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.595
repository downloaded-
>> And Pillow and all that stuff.

80
00:05:05.595 --> 00:05:06.570
>> And everything, yeah.

81
00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:07.280
>> Yeah.

82
00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:12.080
>> We'll go ahead and
cd into SimpleCV, the directory.

83
00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.388
Right, we also need to do this
one last install, sudo pip

84
00:05:16.388 --> 00:05:20.965
install svgwrite.

85
00:05:20.965 --> 00:05:24.060
>> What's that do?

86
00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:28.830
>> It's required for
the the SimpleCV libraries.

87
00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:34.912
So, if you think you missed anything,
there's a, if you do a quick ls here,

88
00:05:34.912 --> 00:05:39.428
there's a document that if
you cat requirements.txt.

89
00:05:39.428 --> 00:05:44.420
So, there's all the python libraries
we'll need for the SimpleCV.

90
00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:46.630
And instead of pill,
you'll need Pillow instead.

91
00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:48.030
So, we did that for you.

92
00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:51.774
>> All right.
>> All right, now, finally,

93
00:05:51.774 --> 00:05:57.510
we'll do sudo python,
oops, setup py install.

94
00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:06.022
And this will unpack everything
you'll need actually for the python.

95
00:06:06.022 --> 00:06:10.500
So then,
with this you don't even have to have to

96
00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:15.850
have the library in the same
directory as the python scripts.

97
00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:21.360
You just need to use import SimpleCV and
then you're good to go.

98
00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.705
>> That's awesome.

99
00:06:22.705 --> 00:06:27.190
>> Yeah, we'll show you in more detail
how the hell it works in the next module,

100
00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:30.680
because with that,
we're pretty much done here.

101
00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.597
>> So you're ready to go pretty much
with all your libraries, so yeah,

102
00:06:32.597 --> 00:06:33.734
I guess we'll see you in the next video.

103
00:06:33.734 --> 00:06:37.845
>> Yeah, actually, but then there's one
more thing you could do if you really like

104
00:06:37.845 --> 00:06:39.600
is if you like the IDLE 3.

105
00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:40.400
>> Get a nice text editor?

106
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:40.960
>> Editor, yeah.

107
00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:44.170
>> So you might already have IDLE 3,
we did that in course 3, but

108
00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:46.870
if you don't,
then you might want to try and grab it.

109
00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:53.800
>> Yeah, the simple command for
that would be sudo apt get install idle.

110
00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:54.730
And there you go.

111
00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:56.360
You got IDLE 3, a nice little editor.

112
00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:02.170
Here, though, I'll probably be using vim,
which is just another text editor.

113
00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:06.490
We'll mention that again in the next
module, so stay tuned for that.
