00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.540
So we want to start this off by,
like I said in the intro,

2
00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.800
talking about the couple of
the characteristics of computer vision.

3
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.130
So I'm going to ask Randy here,
what is computer vision, Randy?

4
00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:15.490
>> Well, like we mentioned before,
if you checked out module one,

5
00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.170
the terminology or in acronyms.

6
00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:23.130
So Computer Vision is basically,
CV, Computer Vision, and

7
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.240
it is processing or analyzing of
images for some kind of purpose,

8
00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:33.960
say for research, or just for
image editing, or something like that.

9
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.792
Some big examples, would be SnapChat for
filtering, or PhotoShop for

10
00:00:38.792 --> 00:00:40.186
modifying images.

11
00:00:40.186 --> 00:00:46.930
And the basic overarching
principle to computer vision, is,

12
00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:53.390
I would say, is trying to recreate what
the human body does when we see things.

13
00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:59.140
So, we try to make a computer system
where it has images, and makes

14
00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.007
some kind of decision, or obtains some
kind of information from those images.

15
00:01:03.007 --> 00:01:08.850
Say, if we see someone
try to take our stuff,

16
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.890
we say, crap,
they're trying to take our stuff.

17
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:11.819
I gotta stop them.
>> [LAUGH]

18
00:01:11.819 --> 00:01:13.297
>> The computer might not know that, so

19
00:01:13.297 --> 00:01:16.180
you need to program that computer,
to tell the computer say,

20
00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.980
if someone comes up and
grabs this item and

21
00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.210
it's not there anymore, you need to
send an alert to somebody or something.

22
00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.300
>> Yeah, there are a lot
of great tools you can use.

23
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.130
I mean, here, you're going to see some
libraries that are used that were

24
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.930
already created.

25
00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:30.670
>> Yeah.
>> But if you have a chance,

26
00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.540
I would recommend also
checking out MATLAB.

27
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.050
They have a lot of cool filters in there.

28
00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.574
>> Yeah.
>> Transforms that you can take of images.

29
00:01:37.574 --> 00:01:38.980
>> Mm-hm.

30
00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.120
>> I remember doing a few cool things
in one of the introduction classes

31
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.850
here at UCSD, Introduction to Machine
Intelligence, where you can actually

32
00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.800
create applications to detect lanes,
just by taking thresholds,

33
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.660
sending the closer to whites down to
white, sending to the closer to blacks up

34
00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.550
to black
>> And then just scanning the pixels, and

35
00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.310
finding where the thresholds are, and

36
00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.280
just do that really quickly through a ton
of images, and next thing you know,

37
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.210
that's how you're detecting lanes
with a camera on your car, right?

38
00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:13.630
>> Yeah, it's pretty cool.

39
00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.690
And then also want to go
back on the libraries thing.

40
00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.340
We're mainly talking about Simple and
OpenCV, but

41
00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.960
we also want to mention
FastCV which is by Qualcomm.

42
00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.810
But we haven't really worked with that so

43
00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.576
we'll be mostly talking about open and
simple CV.

44
00:02:27.576 --> 00:02:33.085
>> Yeah, there is FastCV,
it's Qualcomm libraries developed to do,

45
00:02:33.085 --> 00:02:36.063
I want to say, a lot more complex stuff
with their particular processors.

46
00:02:36.063 --> 00:02:37.219
>> Mm-hm.

47
00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:40.297
>> But yeah, anyways, we're going to
be working mostly with OpenCV and

48
00:02:40.297 --> 00:02:41.215
SimpleCV, right?

49
00:02:41.215 --> 00:02:43.250
>> Yeah, it's more general, I believe.

50
00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.810
>> Cool, cool.

51
00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:49.010
All right, well, hopefully we gave you
some good talking points, or searching

52
00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.415
points for Google, for you to go out and
do a little bit more research on your own.

53
00:02:52.415 --> 00:02:52.960
>> Mm-hm.

54
00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.040
Otherwise, stay tuned.

55
00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.440
We will get to building that app shortly.
