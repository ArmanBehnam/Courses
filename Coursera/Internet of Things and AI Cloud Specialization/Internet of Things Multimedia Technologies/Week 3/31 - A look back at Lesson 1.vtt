00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:06.800
As always it's time to sum up
this lesson on computer vision,

2
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.170
or mainly computer vision, right.

3
00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:10.100
>> Yeah it's computer vision.

4
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.060
>> Great so what do we go over?

5
00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:14.740
>> We just talked about what
defines computer vision,

6
00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:16.980
what kind of field it encapsulates.

7
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.080
And we also talked about things
that apply computer vision.

8
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.345
You know, we talked about the Alpha Dog,
the creepy dog that you talked about.

9
00:00:27.345 --> 00:00:32.132
>> [LAUGH] Yeah, some interesting
applications that hopefully spark

10
00:00:32.132 --> 00:00:37.160
something inside of you all out there that
>> That might

11
00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.790
interest you in making something
similar or better or cooler.

12
00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.120
But, yeah, so there you go.

13
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.770
It was fun hopefully, you stick around and
watch us build this application coming up.

14
00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:49.820
Randy's going to build it for you here.
