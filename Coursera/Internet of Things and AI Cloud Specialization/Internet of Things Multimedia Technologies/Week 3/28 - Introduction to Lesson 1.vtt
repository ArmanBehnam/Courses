Hello everyone and
welcome to Lesson 1 of this module,

2
00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.610
module three here with the multimedia
aspects of the Internet of Things.

3
00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.871
In this lesson, as always, we want to
kind of cover what you're going to

4
00:00:14.871 --> 00:00:17.598
see in general in the next
couple of videos.

5
00:00:17.598 --> 00:00:20.610
So we're going to start out by
talking about Computer Vision, right?

6
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:26.010
>> Yeah, Computer Vision, so that's the
application we'll be building later on.

7
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.910
We mentioned before so we'll be
building a Computer Vision application.

8
00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.410
We talk about, what is Computer Vision?

9
00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.660
You guys probably don't
know what it is quite yet.

10
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.313
>> It is what it sounds like, right?

11
00:00:35.313 --> 00:00:40.720
[LAUGH] We want to give you
some of their characteristics,

12
00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.660
and we also want to give you some
examples and applications that

13
00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.430
you might be able to apply what we're
going to show you in the future.

14
00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.720
>> Yeah, just like the last course.

15
00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.030
It's pretty Bare Bones app, so
feel free to take our suggestions,

16
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.990
or whatever you guys can
think of then add to it.

17
00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.440
>> Absolutely, so we look forward to
seeing you in the next videos coming up.
