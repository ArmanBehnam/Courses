00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:06.000
Now Randy, this is the last summary
of the kind of the last course

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.510
of the specialization?

3
00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:09.440
I mean,
next course you have the capstone project?

4
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.021
>> All right.

5
00:00:10.021 --> 00:00:11.020
>> But, this kind of last course?

6
00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:13.130
>> Yes, it's kind of raps and
so, everything up right?

7
00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.920
>> It does everything up, I'm thinking
maybe I might to have you comeback later

8
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.857
to make a closing video after this one.

9
00:00:18.857 --> 00:00:22.164
>> Sure.
>> [CROSSTALK] Anyways, to wrap us this

10
00:00:22.164 --> 00:00:28.018
lesson, lesson three, it was mainly
about the application, right?

11
00:00:28.018 --> 00:00:31.245
>> Right,
the hard thing about the CV application.

12
00:00:31.245 --> 00:00:33.820
>> Yeah, so we showed you,
we talked to you about

13
00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.430
the different libraries that we used and
that we hope that you, we'll use for

14
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.210
your projects, maybe even find
some more cool ones out there.

15
00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:42.790
But, we showed you how to get them.

16
00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.920
We showed you how to pull them to your
DragonBoard 410c, how to access them, and

17
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.070
how to use them in a whole
bunch of different ways.

18
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:50.960
Primarily what,

19
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.240
with the basic application all we really
did was just pull an image, right?

20
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.480
>> Yeah, just take a picture with
the camera, make sure it works,

21
00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.340
make sure your SimpleCV and
everything is installed correctly.

22
00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.980
>> Yeah.

23
00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:05.470
>> After that, we can add some actual
CV things such as facial recognition,

24
00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.340
a color filter, or the contour lines.

25
00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.640
>> Yeah, and that's a really cool,

26
00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:18.070
I was actually very surprised about
how powerful these libraries are,

27
00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.270
when Randy was working through
that stuff and showing everything.

28
00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.670
I mean, it's amazing and
the possibilities are endless.

29
00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.772
So, take it to your advantage, and
build something for your house.

30
00:01:29.772 --> 00:01:32.430
You could buy something,
but we've said it before.

31
00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.720
It's so,
gratifying to build it on your own.

32
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:36.420
>> Exactly.

33
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.530
And then remember,
I found these functions online.

34
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.320
So, guys can do the same thing,
look it up,

35
00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.900
check it out, maybe there's one to change
the whole the increase the green hues or

36
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.660
something like that,
you might find really neat.

37
00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:54.190
>> Yeah and we want to make sure
that at the end of this video,

38
00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.260
in particular, you'll find
a little reading section there.

39
00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.620
And what we want to do is we want to
provide you with, at the very least,

40
00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:02.810
some links.

41
00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.640
To some cool spots where you can go to
find out more about these libraries, and

42
00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:14.140
then we want to give you a GitHub or
a way to access the code that we used.

43
00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.740
>> Yeah.
>> So, all of the code that you saw

44
00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.880
throughout this course in particular
will be available to you,

45
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.610
either throughout the lessons,
at the end of each lesson,

46
00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.120
that we kind of showed you or
at the very end of this video, as well.

47
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.820
>> Right.
>> Either on a GitHub,

48
00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.420
you've been using GitHub so, you'll
probably be able to just pull it from

49
00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.578
GitHub, have you've been doing
throughout the other courses.

50
00:02:33.578 --> 00:02:38.930
>> Yep, if you have any questions,
please go on the discussion boards.

51
00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.090
Every course has a discussion board.

52
00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.950
I'm on there, Randy's on there sometimes,
some of the other people

53
00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.330
you've seen throughout the other courses,
they're all on there, Jacob, Eric.

54
00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.750
We all try to help you
out as much possible.

55
00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.340
Also feel free to help
your fellow students.

56
00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.140
They really appreciate it.

57
00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.690
We all appreciate your help and
your contributions to this community.

58
00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.310
So, keep programming.

59
00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.980
We'll see you in the next
course which is the Capstone.

60
00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.270
We'll be building some cool stuff and
we hope you enjoyed everything.

61
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.470
So, keep programming.

62
00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:13.010
Have some fun.
