00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:00.940
Hey, everyone.

2
00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:05.570
So, now we're going to go ahead and
create the very basic application,

3
00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:09.870
showing you how to use the simple CV and
your camera.

4
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.620
So go ahead and take a look at this
screen right here for the drawing board.

5
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.820
>> You're starting right where you left
off when we setup in the last lesson, so.

6
00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:17.830
>> Yeah, basically.

7
00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:18.440
>> Yeah.

8
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.110
>> So, right now we're in the SimpleCV
directory, but I'm going to go ahead and

9
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.650
create a new one on the desktop.

10
00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:30.858
So create a new folder right here,
and we'll call it, say, CV Project.

11
00:00:30.858 --> 00:00:34.050
Right there, it's right there.

12
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:41.800
And then to get to that,
we'll say CD Desktop and CV Projects.

13
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:42.920
Cool.

14
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.355
So, the basic application,
we'll just say vim

15
00:00:47.355 --> 00:00:55.364
BasicCVApp.py.

16
00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.830
So Vim is just a text editor.

17
00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:59.690
It's idle three.

18
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.270
I'm pretty used to it so
I just like to use it.

19
00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:06.230
>> I like Vim too, I mean it's simple.

20
00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.806
It's there.

21
00:01:06.806 --> 00:01:11.250
>> So since we don't need to,
as we mentioned

22
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.730
before we don't have to have the SimpleCV
libraries in the same directory.

23
00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.770
So we just go ahead and
type import SimpleCV.

24
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.450
So now we have the camera library set up.

25
00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.040
And next,
we'll get a reference to the camera.

26
00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:38.208
So cam = SimpleCV.Camera.

27
00:01:38.208 --> 00:01:42.553
And make sure you have all
your capitalization correct or

28
00:01:42.553 --> 00:01:46.548
you'll get some errors in
your code when you run it.

29
00:01:46.548 --> 00:01:48.416
And we'll take an image.

30
00:01:48.416 --> 00:01:52.836
So, image = cam.getImage.

31
00:01:52.836 --> 00:01:57.770
>> [COUGH]
>> I think we just save it.

32
00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.310
So, img.save.

33
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.938
Normally, when you save it,
it'll save to the same directory.

34
00:02:07.938 --> 00:02:10.410
The script is running, but

35
00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:16.223
I tend to like having a absolute
file pass so nothing goes wrong.

36
00:02:16.223 --> 00:02:20.865
So do /home/linaro/,

37
00:02:20.865 --> 00:02:25.507
let's put it on desktop,

38
00:02:25.507 --> 00:02:32.261
Desktop/my_first_image.png.

39
00:02:32.261 --> 00:02:33.001
Cool.

40
00:02:33.001 --> 00:02:34.730
Yeah, that's basically everything.

41
00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.470
So, we'll go ahead and
save it and get out of the Vim.

42
00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:39.930
And we'll go ahead and run it.

43
00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.607
We'll type in python.

44
00:02:43.607 --> 00:02:44.907
>> You mean pseudo-python?

45
00:02:44.907 --> 00:02:45.882
>> No, we don't actually.

46
00:02:45.882 --> 00:02:46.407
>> Okay.

47
00:02:46.407 --> 00:02:47.627
>> So we just run it like this.

48
00:02:47.627 --> 00:02:48.925
Enter.

49
00:02:48.925 --> 00:02:50.565
Did it run it?

50
00:02:55.065 --> 00:02:57.445
Did it do it?

51
00:02:57.445 --> 00:02:58.325
Cool.

52
00:02:58.325 --> 00:02:59.273
Took a picture.

53
00:02:59.273 --> 00:03:00.100
There it is.

54
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.700
>> Yeah.

55
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.130
So, you didn't see it, but
a green light flashed on our camera too.

56
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.586
>> Can we see the image?

57
00:03:05.586 --> 00:03:06.545
>> Here we are.

58
00:03:06.545 --> 00:03:08.290
>> [LAUGH]
>> Nice.

59
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:09.130
>> That's cool.

60
00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:14.200
>> Yep, so
that's a very basic imaging for us.

61
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.969
And, if this doesn't work or
the image shows up black it could

62
00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:23.831
mean that something went wrong
in the SimpleCV library setup or

63
00:03:23.831 --> 00:03:28.436
maybe something went wrong
with the Python installation.

64
00:03:28.436 --> 00:03:31.860
And, yeah, that's basically it.

65
00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.810
>> Great.
>> So that's it for this application.

66
00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.040
Stick around and
we'll be adding more cool, neat features.
