00:00:01.986 --> 00:00:06.155
Hey everyone, so now we're going to go
ahead and talk about the differences and

2
00:00:06.155 --> 00:00:08.154
similarities of Open and SimpleCV.

3
00:00:10.187 --> 00:00:11.026
>> We got there.

4
00:00:11.026 --> 00:00:11.926
>> Yeah, [LAUGH].

5
00:00:11.926 --> 00:00:12.831
>> All right, [LAUGH].

6
00:00:12.831 --> 00:00:15.130
>> First we'll talk
about some similarities.

7
00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:21.570
They're both two, free open source
libraries that we'll be, we can use.

8
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:22.900
You can use as well.

9
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.490
Since we're going to be working in Python,

10
00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.620
these two are perfect, because they both
have their own Python distributions.

11
00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:35.260
SimpleCV is, I believe, only in Python,
while OpenCV's in many other languages.

12
00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.290
So, if you didn't want to work in Python,
you could create your own CV application

13
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:47.180
using OpenCV, and in Java, maybe,
or in C, in C++, whatever you want.

14
00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.240
>> Definitely.
I'd suggest actually pausing right now and

15
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.790
maybe taking those links down.

16
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.670
>> Yeah, those are their websites,

17
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.760
and you can get downloads there and-
>> More information.

18
00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:58.520
>> More information.

19
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.030
There's documentation on the classes and

20
00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.990
everything else, all the functions
you can use and the libraries.

21
00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:09.840
So let's go ahead and talk about some of
the differences between the libraries.

22
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:10.340
>> Okay.

23
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.010
>> Yeah.
>> So

24
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.270
why would you be choosing SimpleCV and
there's, if you've ever used Python,

25
00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.010
you type in Python and come in line and
you have a little interactive shell where

26
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.130
you can test out some functions It
maybe save your script later on.

27
00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.050
SimpleCV has the same thing where you
could say, you want to make a quick test,

28
00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.980
make sure your camera's working.

29
00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.460
So you could say camera.getImage or
something like that.

30
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.790
It's very simple to use, so
that's one reason we chose SimpleCV.

31
00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.570
Works great for a demonstration,
works very well, Python,

32
00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.250
since it's mainly only written Python.

33
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.370
And it's, like the name implies, is very
simple, so it's a good place to start.

34
00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.610
The functions are very obvious.

35
00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.360
I don't know, things like that.

36
00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.760
>> No, yeah.
>> Obviously,

37
00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.030
since SimpleCV actually
is based off of OpenCV,

38
00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.660
you could easily replicate what
we're about to do in OpenCV.

39
00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:08.310
>> Yeah, you're going to see.

40
00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.032
So it's really that simple.

41
00:02:10.032 --> 00:02:11.850
You activate the library.

42
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:12.530
>> Yeah.
>> You make sure that

43
00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.260
it's inside the same folder as your
script that you're going to create.

44
00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.880
>> Yeah.

45
00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.540
>> You import the library into your,
>> Yeah, import it.

46
00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.080
>> Into your script and
then you start coding in Python.

47
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.210
Right?
And

48
00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.370
you can use the functions inside there.

49
00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.990
>> And like we mentioned before,
Qualcomm has their own computer vision,

50
00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.170
which is called FastCV, made for
the Snapdragon processors.

51
00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:41.000
We decided to go ahead and stick with
these Open Source computer vision ones,

52
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:48.610
because you could say expand it into maybe
your own computer or something like that.

53
00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:49.680
>> Yeah, absolutely.

54
00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:50.700
All right, cool.

55
00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.410
So we're all set on that, are we?

56
00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:53.900
>> Yeah, we're all set and next,

57
00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.110
we'll go ahead and begin setting
up the computer vision libraries.

58
00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.900
>> Yeah, so
hook in your DragonBoard right now because

59
00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.900
it's going to be some
screen casting coming up.

60
00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:03.400
See you then..
