00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.110
Time to look back at what
we covered in this lesson.

2
00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.990
In particular, we were focusing on
the libraries and your overall environment

3
00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:13.830
setup for
programming a CV application, right?

4
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.370
>> Like Robert just said,
we were talking about the Simple and

5
00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:22.170
OpenCV libraries that'll you create
the Computer Vision application and

6
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.980
then there's a ton of commands.

7
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.220
Make sure you get them all right or
you might have some problems getting

8
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.780
the libraries all set up,
maybe your Python won't work as well.

9
00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.900
>> Yeah, and I know we didn't show
you all the commands except other

10
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.010
than just typing them in front of you, but

11
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.170
you will have access to the slides, as
always, as all the other courses you have.

12
00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:47.960
And all the commands in order,
the step-by-step process is in the slides.

13
00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.030
So this particular slide's for
module three, lesson two.

14
00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.890
>> Yeah.

15
00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.980
>> Download those module three slides,
and you'll have access.

16
00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.540
>> Yeah, also,
we didn't really cover debugging tips.

17
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.880
So you'll easily know if
something's wrong with your setup

18
00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.420
if you type in Simple CV
into the command line and

19
00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.510
it doesn't open up the interactive
shell that I mentioned before.

20
00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:14.090
>> Great.
So stay tuned for

21
00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.620
the next lesson where we will actually
start building the script that will

22
00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.700
use these libraries.

23
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:20.210
So see you soon.
