WEBVTT

1
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:08.200
It's time to talk about some of
the applications that you might be able to

2
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.820
hopefully, eventually, do.

3
00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:15.330
Yeah, that's the goal of this, is to set
a foundation for you on which to build on.

4
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.570
We wanted to talk to you a little bit
about some of these cool things that we

5
00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.211
found on the internet,
as well as just brainstorm some

6
00:00:25.211 --> 00:00:28.930
stuff that you can do with SimpleCV and
OpenCV.

7
00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.780
Just computer vision,
in general, for future projects.

8
00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.080
We want you to remember at least,

9
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.590
don't reinvent the wheel,
we have these libraries available to you.

10
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.290
I believe Randy's going
to provide them for you.

11
00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.930
>> Yeah.

12
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.860
>> At least a method to retrieve them.

13
00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.710
>> Yeah.
We'll go through a setup later on in

14
00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.600
the next lesson, I believe.

15
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.050
>> Absolutely.

16
00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.220
Randy, what are some cool things that
you could do with computer vision?

17
00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.150
>> We mentioned before,

18
00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.570
you can do things like setting up facial
recognition, that would be pretty cool.

19
00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.910
We'll help you guys set that up.

20
00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.760
Create things such as filters
to maybe edit colors or

21
00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:13.560
change the brightness, a lot of things
that modern day cameras can do or

22
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.518
applications such as Snapchat or
Instagram.

23
00:01:15.518 --> 00:01:20.460
>> We thought of a really cool
application, I mean feel free to use it

24
00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.120
everyone out there but
taking in one of our sensors that

25
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:31.030
we used in, I think, course three,
along with maybe a stepper motor that you

26
00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.990
learned how to use in course three,
and a camera with facial recognition.

27
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:42.490
You show up to your door and
the PIR sensor or

28
00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.950
some sensor triggers, then the camera
takes a picture of your face.

29
00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.180
Does the camera recognize your face or
does it not recognize your face?

30
00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.460
if it recognizes your face,

31
00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.170
the stepper motor triggers, opens up
your deadbolt, you're in the door.

32
00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.450
If it doesn't recognize your face,
it takes the picture, sends it to Randy's

33
00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.480
cell phone, and warns him that someone's
at his door that he doesn't want there.

34
00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:08.780
So, a really cool application that
takes in almost every single course

35
00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.490
that we've done so
far in the specialization.

36
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.650
You got the connectivity to the WiFi,

37
00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.080
Bluetooth, sending images across
networks with the internet.

38
00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.790
>> The step promoter
>> Step promoter.

39
00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:22.750
>> GPIL control.

40
00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.230
>> GPIL control in general,

41
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.810
I know we're going to be coming
out with some I2C sensors soon and

42
00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.260
you will actually also have access to
really cool sensory board on 96boards.org.

43
00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:39.210
You check that out too,
it's coming out for the Dragon Board 410C.

44
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:40.970
Yeah, so
really cool stuff that you can do.

45
00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.860
That's just one example,
we will be talking about more right now.

46
00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.590
What other things can you do or
create with Fast CV or CV, in general?

47
00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.180
>> This robot, I don't know if you've seen
it on the internet, it's pretty creepy,

48
00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.710
actually, it's pretty creepy how it works.

49
00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:02.280
It's almost like a walking cow,

50
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.220
but I mean, I've seen people kick it,
I've seen people try.

51
00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.220
>> What?
>> Have you seen that robot yet?

52
00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.810
>> No, I have not.

53
00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:09.940
>> Man.
>> This is interesting.

54
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:10.740
I'm learning here.

55
00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:11.880
>> Yeah, it's great.

56
00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.510
These people built this robot,
Boston Dynamics.

57
00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.580
In fact, they have a lot of cool
robots that Boston Dynamics built.

58
00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:22.440
They got a huge fund from DARPA
to continue building this robot,

59
00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.830
making it better and
it's all computer vision.

60
00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:31.240
Designed originally to help
soldiers out in the field transport

61
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.850
medical supplies, extra rations,
food, ammunition.

62
00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.730
>> A bunch of gear that's heavy.

63
00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.840
>> Yeah, a bunch of gear that's heavy,
absolutely, and it's all terrain.

64
00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:42.660
It's crazy.

65
00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:43.460
Look it up online.

66
00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:48.600
Look up Boston Dynamics on the YouTube,
Boston Dynamics Robots.

67
00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.280
Really cool robots that they make.

68
00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.870
This one's really creepy because you just
can't knock it over, on ice, on sand,

69
00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:55.379
dirt, whatever.

70
00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.120
Here's another cool thing and
these are becoming more and

71
00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.460
more prominent,
if that's the word, in households.

72
00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:09.410
Automated robots that kind
of represent humanoids, so

73
00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:14.820
I guess you can call them
semi-humanoid robots.

74
00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.220
You're going to start seeing
stuff like this more and

75
00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:24.050
more as we dive more
into computer vision and

76
00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.770
robotics and these microcontrollers and
system on chip computers.

77
00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.880
Everything's getting more and
more powerful, and

78
00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.890
you're going to start seeing interactive
robots like this one, right here.

79
00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:41.800
Imagine going to a nursing home and
no one there is ever lonely

80
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.350
because they each have their own robot to
talk to and play chess with and whatever.

81
00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.090
Not only that,
I've seen some really cool stuff

82
00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:54.759
just recently at
the AT&T Developer Summit.

83
00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:59.640
There was an application that someone
developed for people with Alzheimer's, and

84
00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.620
as you can see right there, reminders,
suggestions, prompts, scheduling,

85
00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:10.120
if you have any of these issues or
disorders.

86
00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:16.410
The things that we take for
granted everyday can be easily shown or

87
00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:21.930
done or I guess, what, taught to a robot,
programmed into a robot.

88
00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.990
You'll start seeing these
things pop up more and more and

89
00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.890
hopefully, you all out there are the ones
who are kind of fueling this movement.

90
00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:36.700
This one was interesting,
I picked this also off the internet.

91
00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:42.010
But these are unmanned jellyfish
elimination robots and

92
00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:45.730
they're called called Jellyfish
Elimination Robotic Swarms, JEROS.

93
00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:49.370
>> JEROS, however they pronounce it but
they float in the ocean,

94
00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:53.140
they are there to manage
jellyfish overpopulation.

95
00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:56.030
Now, I guess they drop some nets in there.

96
00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:58.870
First, obviously, they float around
when they detect the movement.

97
00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:00.090
The camera detects a movement.

98
00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:04.910
It hopefully sees that it's a jellyfish,
so there's some computer

99
00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:10.030
vision program in there that
detects that it's a jellyfish.

100
00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:15.580
It drops a net, and
then the net pulls the jellyfish up, and

101
00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:19.350
then there's some propeller
that just obliterates it.

102
00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:20.110
>> Yeah.

103
00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:22.150
>> So that's how it does it.

104
00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:28.850
Yeah, I mean, there you go,
more ways to use motion sensors,

105
00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:32.190
computer vision and motors.

106
00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:35.670
>> These are just a couple
of suggestions or ideas or

107
00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:40.020
real world applications out there and
don't forget you can, of course,

108
00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:44.460
come up with your own ideas, go ahead and
try to implement them, things like that.

109
00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:48.220
>> Yeah, so, there you go,
those were some examples.

110
00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:50.400
There's hundreds, thousands,
probably, examples out there.

111
00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:51.240
You can go ahead and search for

112
00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:54.570
more computer vision cool
projects that people have done.

113
00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:59.930
Or maybe you have one in mind and
you want to amaze us on the discussions.

114
00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:01.450
Go ahead, show us what you got.

115
00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:06.160
Other than that,
please stick around because we're going to

116
00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:10.060
be getting into the development of
our application, coming up shortly.
