00:00:00.538 --> 00:00:04.709
Welcome back to another
exciting installment of

2
00:00:04.709 --> 00:00:09.091
Multimedia in the Internet
of Things here at UCSC.

3
00:00:09.091 --> 00:00:12.259
So yeah,
this is the beginning of Lesson three,

4
00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:15.930
which is our final lesson of this module.

5
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.240
And we're excited to finally take

6
00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.420
everything that we've talked
about in the last couple lessons,

7
00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.090
the setup that you did in I think,
probably the last couple of videos.

8
00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.390
And bring it all together and
actually start using those libraries,

9
00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.750
do something really cool
in the DragonBoard.

10
00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.078
So yeah, I think it's time.

11
00:00:33.078 --> 00:00:34.336
Randy, what are we going to
cover in this lesson?

12
00:00:34.336 --> 00:00:39.028
>> Yeah, so the first part of this lesson
we'll just make sure the camera works.

13
00:00:39.028 --> 00:00:41.848
Make sure your camera works,
like we got over right here.

14
00:00:41.848 --> 00:00:42.988
>> Got a little USB camera.

15
00:00:42.988 --> 00:00:44.840
>> Yeah, a webcam of any sort.

16
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.060
And then we'll create
a very basic application,

17
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.092
just take a picture,
just make sure it works.

18
00:00:50.092 --> 00:00:53.528
And then after that,
we'll go ahead and add some features.

19
00:00:53.528 --> 00:00:56.608
By features, I mean all the things
we've been mentioning, the CV stuff.

20
00:00:56.608 --> 00:00:58.503
Maybe some facial recognition,

21
00:00:58.503 --> 00:01:02.708
some filters to change the colors in
your picture, something like that.

22
00:01:02.708 --> 00:01:09.688
Hopefully to, and we'll point you out to
documentation that the simple CV has.

23
00:01:09.688 --> 00:01:13.751
That'll allow you to create
your own application,

24
00:01:13.751 --> 00:01:18.010
apply your own things based
on what you can find.

25
00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:22.262
And finally we will do a little neat
thing where we'll, what we've done before

26
00:01:22.262 --> 00:01:26.069
was to set up a little server that you
could upload your pictures to, and

27
00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:27.478
you could view remotely.

28
00:01:29.288 --> 00:01:29.905
>> Great.
Well,

29
00:01:29.905 --> 00:01:31.288
we'll see you in the next videos, then.

30
00:01:31.288 --> 00:01:32.886
