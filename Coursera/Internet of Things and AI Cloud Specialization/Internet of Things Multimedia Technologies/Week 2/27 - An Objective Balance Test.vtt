1
00:00:02.744 --> 00:00:08.220
We were looking at ways of
doing objective balance test.

2
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:14.930
And so, how is this balance
testing currently done now?

3
00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.930
It's very subjective and
it's non-repeatable,

4
00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:25.848
the same test, and
there is a lot inter-rater variability.

5
00:00:25.848 --> 00:00:31.598
That is, the tests are you sit down and
stand up five times,

6
00:00:31.598 --> 00:00:37.680
and how quickly you're able to
do that without your hands.

7
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.508
You walk for three minutes back and forth.

8
00:00:40.508 --> 00:00:46.060
And the other famous
test is one foot stand.

9
00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:51.070
You stand on one foot and
if you're not able to maintain balance,

10
00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:52.270
you get little bit more wobbly.

11
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.559
You do the same thing
with your eyes closed,

12
00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:03.475
then it becomes lot more difficult
to maintain your balance.

13
00:01:03.475 --> 00:01:07.342
And people grade this on
a scale of one to five, and

14
00:01:07.342 --> 00:01:10.300
then they add these multiple scores.

15
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.580
So the real gold standard for
balance assessment is gait labs,

16
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.230
where people are put inside a lab.

17
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:23.076
These are hundreds of
thousand dollar costing labs,

18
00:01:23.076 --> 00:01:29.480
with lots of sensors everywhere, and it's
very expensive and very time consuming.

19
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:36.839
So most of the times, people don't
prescribe patients for this test.

20
00:01:36.839 --> 00:01:43.069
What if you had a camera that is
actually observing the clinician and

21
00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:48.203
the patient as they go through
these subjective tests,

22
00:01:48.203 --> 00:01:52.682
and the camera is able to
come up with an objective

23
00:01:52.682 --> 00:01:57.100
metric of how you are able
to maintain balance?

24
00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.132
We call this off body sensor instead,

25
00:02:01.132 --> 00:02:05.920
of instrumenting
the patient with lights and

26
00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.345
LEDs and accelerometers,
like done in gait labs.

27
00:02:11.345 --> 00:02:17.988
So, we tried this and the video on
the left side shows a volunteer,

28
00:02:17.988 --> 00:02:24.395
in this case it's me,
doing one foot stand with my eyes closed,

29
00:02:24.395 --> 00:02:28.668
and the pictures on the right-hand side,

30
00:02:28.668 --> 00:02:34.510
each one corresponds to
a 40 millisecond duration.

31
00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.590
This was a 25 frames per second

32
00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.690
video that is extracted from
the output of the DVS camera.

33
00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:49.370
You can see the middle-top row, there is a
lot of wobbliness because there's lots of

34
00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:55.320
brightness, and
the last one, bottom-right,

35
00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:01.590
it's much lighter because I'm able to
maintain postural balance much better.

36
00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.270
And we recently published
this work in IEEE EMBC, and

37
00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.820
we were quite pleased with
the results that we published.

38
00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:17.210
These are ten healthy volunteers, mostly
students and some of the professors.

39
00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:19.555
And this is left foot up.

40
00:03:19.555 --> 00:03:23.210
The blue bars are with eyes open.

41
00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:30.550
And, when you close the eyes, you can see
the y axis is the total visual activity.

42
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.940
We call it total variance.

43
00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:39.710
It shoots up dramatically because
you're not able to maintain balance.

44
00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:45.294
And the ordering as 1PS10
is by self recorded

45
00:03:45.294 --> 00:03:50.885
amount of physical activity
they get in a week.

46
00:03:50.885 --> 00:03:57.410
S1 at ten hours or
more of physical activity and S10 had not.

47
00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:05.330
The same pattern happens for
the right foot also.

48
00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.650
But you can clearly see
that there is lot more

49
00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:15.550
resolution between when they're able to
maintain balance and when they're not.

50
00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:21.364
The orange bar is with the one foot up,
eyes closed, but this time,

51
00:04:21.364 --> 00:04:28.040
they're not holding the chair,
they're just putting a finger there.

52
00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.290
That provides feedback.

53
00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.950
You know how long your hand is and

54
00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:38.600
it just gives you a context of
where you're in the 3D space, and

55
00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.480
dramatically, you're able to
maintain very good balance.

56
00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.500
So, this is the point
I was trying to make.

57
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.620
You give somebody a walking stick or
a walker, their risk for

58
00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.370
falls drops down dramatically.

59
00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:59.060
The other thing that I wanted to
point out here was if you look at S2

60
00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:04.030
compared to the left foot and
right foot, S2 happens to be me and

61
00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:09.460
I have miniscule scars in my knees
from tennis and so on and so forth.

62
00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:15.720
And it was able to pick up right of it,
that one foot was weaker than the other.

63
00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.780
So we think there is a lot of
promise with this off body sensor

64
00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:25.390
that is essentially
working the background.

65
00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:30.570
And along with the subjective rating
that the clinicians come up with,

66
00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:34.400
we have an objective
metric to add to that.

67
00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:39.465
And this is the spectrum of the raw data

68
00:05:39.465 --> 00:05:44.847
that we extract from the visual sensor,

69
00:05:44.847 --> 00:05:52.627
along with a balance board
that has four accelerometers.

70
00:05:52.627 --> 00:05:59.660
And it's supposed to correlate with
the gold standard of a force plate.

71
00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:07.000
And you can see that under 2 Hertz, there
is very, very nice correlation between

72
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.910
the signals seen by the DVS camera and
the balance board.

73
00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:20.817
In fact, we reported 99% Pierson
correlation between the gold standard and

74
00:06:20.817 --> 00:06:25.280
what we are able to do with this camera.

75
00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:29.850
So, essentially what

76
00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:34.410
I'm trying to convey is,
all the tools that we double up for,

77
00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:39.890
wireless communication that
became into the cellphone,

78
00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:45.490
the smartphone, the Internet of Things,
the audio content,

79
00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:51.990
we can actually leverage them for
a lot of new sensing modalities.

80
00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:57.338
It's not just a person to
person communication anymore,

81
00:06:57.338 --> 00:07:00.510
like voice, or video, or audio.

82
00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:05.221
It is that, and
machine to human communication,

83
00:07:05.221 --> 00:07:10.460
human to machine, and
even machine to machine.

84
00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:17.920
And as part of this, you will see a lot
more new sensing modalities that come up.

85
00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:23.249
So if we really understand how we
are able to get that huge savings

86
00:07:23.249 --> 00:07:29.370
in compressing different types of
microphone signals, audio signals,

87
00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:35.606
video signals, we can very easily
apply them for new sensing modalities.

88
00:07:35.606 --> 00:07:42.462
And I compiled some reading material for
this particular module for you.

89
00:07:42.462 --> 00:07:44.170
In this particular one.

90
00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:48.820
So I hope you will take
advantage of all of this,

91
00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:53.530
and the previous courses get
inspired by course one, and

92
00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:57.010
do a great job in your capstone.

93
00:07:57.010 --> 00:07:58.200
Thank you very much for your time.
