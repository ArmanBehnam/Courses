00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:10.790
This is the novel motion sensing camera
that I wanted to talk to you about.

2
00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:16.666
It's based on research in ZÃ¼rich and

3
00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:20.380
it is not a traditional RGB sensor.

4
00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:26.707
There are no frames, whenever there
is a intensity change at the pixel,

5
00:00:26.707 --> 00:00:32.533
that event is coded as intensity
going up or intensity going down.

6
00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:37.590
And the nice thing about
this is it has got very,

7
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.270
very fine temporal
resolution less then ten

8
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.836
microsecond for detecting pix elements.

9
00:00:46.836 --> 00:00:52.550
The special resolution is poor but
in some applications that's

10
00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.944
not the case that's not an issue
that is definitely not cheap

11
00:00:57.944 --> 00:01:02.944
like reg cameras this hasn't
at the economy sub scale.

12
00:01:02.944 --> 00:01:08.044
And yet, we where interested
in leveraging this camera for

13
00:01:08.044 --> 00:01:12.230
some of the novel visual
processing pipe lines.

14
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:17.439
So I have this video here,
on the top left corner

15
00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:22.781
you have the dept sensing
from a Kinect camera and

16
00:01:22.781 --> 00:01:26.949
on the top right, you see a skeleton,

17
00:01:26.949 --> 00:01:33.210
a stick model,
that is derived from the Kinect.

18
00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.780
The bottom two are from
the devious camera and

19
00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.870
you can see that when a person is moving,

20
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.100
the pixels light up, and
when there is no motion,

21
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.540
there is no information coming
from the camera at all.

22
00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.450
So, the whole concept is based on AER,
that is action,

23
00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.910
event, response, from a sensor.

24
00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:07.080
If there is no action,
no events are generated, and

25
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.250
you save all that bandwidth.

26
00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.446
The one on the right hand side,

27
00:02:12.446 --> 00:02:17.223
is the total visual activity
as the person is moving.

28
00:02:17.223 --> 00:02:21.610
And you can see the cursor
go from left to right and

29
00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.678
you can see the high
intensity activities and

30
00:02:25.678 --> 00:02:29.331
the low motion activities in the video.
