00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.770
In this lesson we will
look at generic models for

2
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.850
compressing and
transmission of multimedia signals.

3
00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:17.038
Specifically we will
look at CD quality audio,

4
00:00:17.038 --> 00:00:22.280
image processing like JPEG,
and video processing.

5
00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:27.140
We will finally look at
quality evaluation issues.

6
00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.150
As I mentioned in course four,
variations on the compression pipeline

7
00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:36.490
are commonly leveraged for
storing and retrieval.

8
00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:40.537
That is for iPod, Netflix,
YouTube, services,

9
00:00:40.537 --> 00:00:45.810
[COUGH] and feature extraction for
mission learning.

10
00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:51.620
This lesson will provide adequate
background to explore these applications,

11
00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.630
but we will be basically looking
at from the transmission paradigm.
