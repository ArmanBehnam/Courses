00:00:02.905 --> 00:00:10.166
In lesson one, we saw how the techniques
that were originally developed for

2
00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:15.045
microphone, speech,
voice communication, for

3
00:00:15.045 --> 00:00:18.789
a lot of multimedia content delivery,

4
00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:24.510
how we were able to play with
the same tools and techniques.

5
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.291
And, every time you have a new sensor,

6
00:00:28.291 --> 00:00:33.332
a new type of signal,
as I described, the trick is in

7
00:00:33.332 --> 00:00:38.375
coming up with the a priori
knowledge of the source or

8
00:00:38.375 --> 00:00:44.011
the sync or the signal itself
to take very good advantage.

9
00:00:44.011 --> 00:00:49.343
And in this context of IOT,
as you have accelerometers or

10
00:00:49.343 --> 00:00:54.674
other body own sensors coming up,
this need to go back and

11
00:00:54.674 --> 00:00:59.897
leverage the techniques
becomes even more important,

12
00:00:59.897 --> 00:01:04.592
and that's really what I
wanted to convey to you.

13
00:01:04.592 --> 00:01:09.418
And in that context,
there is a new camera,

14
00:01:09.418 --> 00:01:14.580
new type of sensor that we are working on.

15
00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.770
It's called a devious camera or
a pixel camera and

16
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.490
I'll tell you about it in lesson one.

17
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.780
And we will look at
the assessment of risk for falls,

18
00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.832
this is particularly
important in health care and

19
00:01:33.832 --> 00:01:36.839
especially for seniors, and

20
00:01:36.839 --> 00:01:41.649
in fact some of the listeners
commented on their

21
00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:47.220
interest of looking at applications for
health care.

22
00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.260
Thank you very much.

23
00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:49.300
Keep it coming.

24
00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.800
This is for those people who responded.

25
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.930
And we use this novel
camera to come up with

26
00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.770
an objective balance test,
a functional balance test.

27
00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:06.640
So this all what we will talk about
in this final lesson of this module.
