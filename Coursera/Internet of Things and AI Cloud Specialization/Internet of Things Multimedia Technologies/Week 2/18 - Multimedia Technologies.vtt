00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:03.280
Hello, all.

2
00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:04.680
Welcome back.

3
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.980
This module is on multimedia technologies.

4
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.030
We will look at how we have been able
to leverage the tools developed for

5
00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:18.210
wise communication in the previous
course for audio, image,

6
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.670
video services, and perhaps going
forward for other novel services.

7
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.700
We have two lessons in this module.

8
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:33.680
The first lesson looks at various
signal processing tools for

9
00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.380
multimedia signal processing.

10
00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.470
I will try to generalize the tools for

11
00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.090
multiple types of signals
as much as possible.

12
00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:48.120
I will sacrifice the technical
nuisances in some places as I

13
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.670
really want to convey the spirit
of processing, so that they can

14
00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:00.640
extend these tricks to other kinds of
signals that we will see in the IOT space.

15
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.540
In the second lesson, I will present
a novel camera sensor that we came across,

16
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.570
and the work that we have been leveraging,
the signal processing tools,

17
00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.340
to use this camera in
health care applications.

18
00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.479
In this case the example is assessing for

19
00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.262
fall risks in the aging population.
