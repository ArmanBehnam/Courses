00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:02.190
That was a fairly long lesson.

2
00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.300
Hope you were able to stay with us.

3
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.700
Maybe I will break longer ones
into shorter lessons in future.

4
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.194
So in this lesson,
we look at audio processing and

5
00:00:14.194 --> 00:00:20.402
how we can leverage some of the concepts
we talked about as a use case.

6
00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.020
So this figure shows the hearing
thresholds with frequency on

7
00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.910
the x-axis and
sound pressure level on y-axis.

8
00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.173
The conversational speech covers
about 50 dB dynamic range or

9
00:00:35.173 --> 00:00:41.300
say about from 30 to 80 dB SPL
depending how loud you talk.

10
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.340
The music usually covers about 100
dB plus or minus dynamic range,

11
00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.050
going from 10 to 20 dB,
almost up to 110, 120 dB.

12
00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:01.114
So, we need the noise to be 100,000
times lower than the signal,

13
00:01:01.114 --> 00:01:06.055
if we want a very clean representation.

14
00:01:06.055 --> 00:01:11.475
Because even a very light amount of noise,
you're able to hear in the audio room.

15
00:01:11.475 --> 00:01:16.691
So the miracle 13dB demo based
on psychoacoustics shows

16
00:01:16.691 --> 00:01:21.801
that you can actually have
much worse signal-to-noise

17
00:01:21.801 --> 00:01:28.620
ratio than 100 dB if you play
the game right with psycho acoustics.

18
00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.878
You won't even hear the noise.

19
00:01:30.878 --> 00:01:35.600
So 13dB means,
between the signal and the noise,

20
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.970
you have only about a factor
of 20 in the voltage domain.

21
00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:45.243
[COUGH] Actually I saw this
demo about 25 years ago and

22
00:01:45.243 --> 00:01:49.591
wanted to recreate it here for
this course.

23
00:01:49.591 --> 00:01:53.627
So the first you will hear,

24
00:01:53.627 --> 00:01:59.250
a stereo original content and Jimmy.

25
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:09.250
[MUSIC]

26
00:02:19.021 --> 00:02:24.083
And now you can hear
the 13dB of flat noise

27
00:02:24.083 --> 00:02:30.550
goes in white noise added to
each window in the signal,

28
00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:35.761
and you're supposed to hear lots of noise.

29
00:02:35.761 --> 00:02:37.885
Take and listen.

30
00:02:37.885 --> 00:02:47.885
[MUSIC]

31
00:02:57.585 --> 00:02:59.300
Did you hear the noise?

32
00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.690
Especially towards the end
in the quiet regions.

33
00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:09.619
So this time, we take exactly the same
amount of white noise in each window,

34
00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:15.682
but we shape it in such a way that
it is right below the signal peaks,

35
00:03:15.682 --> 00:03:19.173
and 13dB below where the signal is.

36
00:03:19.173 --> 00:03:24.365
So the overall signal to noise
ratio is exactly the same in

37
00:03:24.365 --> 00:03:29.355
what you just heard and
what you're going to hear now.

38
00:03:29.355 --> 00:03:39.355
[MUSIC]

39
00:03:49.415 --> 00:03:54.391
Even if you put on headphones and
listen to this very carefully,

40
00:03:54.391 --> 00:03:58.320
you should hear much less or
no noise at all.

41
00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.580
Now, here's the interesting thing.

42
00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.780
If we take these two signals A and

43
00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:10.010
C where we did not hear the difference and
look at the difference,

44
00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:16.260
you will see all that crud that we
introduced in the signal with 13dB SNR.

45
00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.350
And you didn't hear in the other case but
when you hear to it on its own,

46
00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.750
you can actually hear all the mess
that we did with the signal.

47
00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.126
Let's listen to the 5D, Jimmy.

48
00:04:29.126 --> 00:04:39.126
[MUSIC]

49
00:04:50.347 --> 00:04:55.031
So there are two main ideas in taking

50
00:04:55.031 --> 00:05:01.390
advantage of this in the psychoacoustics.

51
00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:07.080
The figure on the left shows what
we call simultaneous masking.

52
00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.939
We talked about critical bands and
the work in AT&T in 1930s,

53
00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:14.756
that is the Fletcher's work.

54
00:05:14.756 --> 00:05:17.360
So, within a critical band,

55
00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.610
if you have a very strong component,
that is called the masker.

56
00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:27.390
It will mask all the neighboring
components in that critical band.

57
00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:30.570
And these are called the masked sums.

58
00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:37.540
And, also, if there is a loud explosion,
like a boom or a symbol.

59
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.030
It's as if the ears goes deaf for
a few milliseconds.

60
00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:45.360
This is shown on the right hand picture.

61
00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.820
This is called post masking.

62
00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:52.240
When you have a loud sound,
you don't hear anything for

63
00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:57.250
about 30 to 80 milliseconds and
then you start hearing the other sounds.

64
00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:02.180
So you can put any garbage in that
region or not code the signals

65
00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:07.610
use very few bits and
still you will have very faithful quality.

66
00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:13.860
There is also this concept of pre-masking
that has been found in psychoacoustics,

67
00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:18.360
but from signal processing
perspective audio coding,

68
00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:22.880
I haven't seen much data rated actions,
as far as I know.

69
00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:28.010
So for audio coding networks,

70
00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:33.340
this is how we take advantage
of the psychoacoustic model.

71
00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.520
This is not an exact block diagram.

72
00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:39.470
You will find many different
block diagrams in the literature.

73
00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:45.650
Actually I have an article by Painter and
Spanius in the further reading section.

74
00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:47.380
You should take a look at that.

75
00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:51.210
But essentially, using our own diagram,

76
00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:55.560
the yellow block on
the top we do a parallel,

77
00:06:55.560 --> 00:07:00.577
very height resolution time
frequency decomposition and

78
00:07:00.577 --> 00:07:05.350
we use that to implement
a psychoacoustic model, and

79
00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:10.180
the output of the psychoacoustic
model are the masking curse.

80
00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:14.573
That's what really drives
the quantization process and

81
00:07:14.573 --> 00:07:20.940
that's really where we get most of
the data rate reductions in MP3 and ASE.

82
00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:27.160
And then we use Huffman coding after
that to reduce the data rates further.
