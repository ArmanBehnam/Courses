00:00:04.653 --> 00:00:09.353
Once we put all of these
different tools together to

2
00:00:09.353 --> 00:00:14.598
address the data rate,
either for transmission, or for

3
00:00:14.598 --> 00:00:20.450
retrieval, you end up with
many many choices, right?

4
00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:26.910
And as we saw in the miracle 13
dB demo and the JPEG images,

5
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.810
the signal to noise ratio does
not always tell the truth.

6
00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:37.390
So we need to have some way
of controlling the quality.

7
00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.600
So for the wide band audio from what
we saw before, you can deduce from,

8
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.782
you can get certain result in
data rates of about 8-12 kbps.

9
00:00:48.782 --> 00:00:54.300
And for CD quality audio,
you can have anywhere

10
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.820
from 64-256 kbps in one of the newer

11
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.950
AEC codecs even at 128 or
192, you have gone

12
00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:11.105
beyond CD quality what people
call real transparent quality.

13
00:01:11.105 --> 00:01:14.395
[COUGH] Then for still images,

14
00:01:14.395 --> 00:01:19.270
you can get anywhere from 30 to 300,

15
00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.600
I think should have been
kilobytes not megabytes.

16
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.570
I have an error here.

17
00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:32.540
Based on what quality you use for
your JPEG compression.

18
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.810
And similarly for about 412 to 1 kbps so

19
00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:46.060
five megabits per second you can
a very decent video quality for

20
00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:52.720
streaming over the internet and
the resultant data size depends on

21
00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:58.200
the content itself to a large extent.

22
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:04.010
If you have Talking Heads, you can
get much better accomplishing ratio,

23
00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.200
as opposed to Federer and
Jokovich playing tennis.

24
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.170
Then, there's lots of motions,
and sometimes motion breaks.

25
00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.030
You need to send more ifibs.

26
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.106
On the audio side,
[COUGH] the quality evaluation

27
00:02:20.106 --> 00:02:27.670
tends to be a lot more tricky
than the that we used for speech.

28
00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.300
So now you are having, asking more

29
00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:36.770
pertinent questions that relate to
the transparency of the signal.

30
00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:42.110
And for one part you need real
expert listeners who have had

31
00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.860
many years of training in
order to evaluate the codex.

32
00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.120
And one of the testing paradigms is ABX.

33
00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:57.270
You're told A is original, and B is either

34
00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:03.040
encoded or
B is definitely not B encoded and decoded.

35
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.190
And, you're given a third segment.

36
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:12.450
Your task is to see if X is very
close to A, or very close to B.

37
00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.950
So, sometimes it will be the original,
sometimes it will be the encoded.

38
00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.864
And the other one is ABC HR.

39
00:03:20.864 --> 00:03:24.490
HR stands for hidden reference.

40
00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:31.720
A and B are the original and
decoded in random order.

41
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.020
And C is always the original.

42
00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:40.800
So you have to actually Identify
which is the process signal and

43
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.090
then assign a subjective scope.

44
00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:49.104
In this course, are usually 0.5 scale.

45
00:03:49.104 --> 00:03:54.600
[COUGH] And some of the ITU,

46
00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.810
International Telecommunications Union,
they're this tester define.

47
00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:04.077
They allow fractional values so

48
00:04:04.077 --> 00:04:07.940
that you cover a much bigger scale.

49
00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:14.850
MUSHRA is multiple stimuli with
hidden reference and anchor.

50
00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:21.210
So in this test, you have a lot more
content that the subjects are looking at.

51
00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:27.916
And you have three or four candidate
codex and you throw in codex for

52
00:04:27.916 --> 00:04:34.624
which we already know the quality
like g.726, g.711, or

53
00:04:34.624 --> 00:04:39.774
for very high quality
codex some of the g.722,

54
00:04:39.774 --> 00:04:44.008
3's that runs at much higher pitching.

55
00:04:44.008 --> 00:04:48.498
And the task of the users,
usually you have

56
00:04:48.498 --> 00:04:54.020
multiple sets of listeners
that listen to this.

57
00:04:54.020 --> 00:05:00.760
And it's almost an art implementing and
running these tests.

58
00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:06.177
So it's a very, very time consuming and
elaborate process,

59
00:05:06.177 --> 00:05:11.072
but they have to go through
all of these when they release

60
00:05:11.072 --> 00:05:16.383
the new version of mp3 codec,
AAC codec, surround sound,

61
00:05:16.383 --> 00:05:20.830
HE-AAC which has the sub-band application.

62
00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:25.200
Well, I didn't talk about that in
the technology, so let's leave that.

63
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:30.030
So, there is always a need for

64
00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:34.850
a subjective tool to
kind of quickly assess,

65
00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.490
especially during
the algorithm development, and

66
00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:45.570
one of the notable ones for this
objective quality measurement is peak.

67
00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:49.340
Perceptual evaluation of audio quality.

68
00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:54.600
And this branch of research is
almost a science by itself because

69
00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:59.800
you take the original signal and you take
the process signal, and you implement

70
00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:05.330
the cyte acoustics just
the way some recordings do.

71
00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:11.240
And you extract various sets of
features and combinations and outcomes,

72
00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:18.140
and MOV, this is an acronym for
Model Output Variables.

73
00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:23.020
Then you put them all together and
come up with a grade,

74
00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:27.930
and we have used this tool
in my work in the past.

75
00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:31.750
And, as a first cut, it's very very good.

76
00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:35.050
It takes us through
the initial experimentation

77
00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:39.780
as we are trying to select a specific
codec, specific data rate, or

78
00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:44.520
a new codec algorithms, and
there's some commercial versions, and

79
00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:51.840
there's an University version
that are free on the internet.
