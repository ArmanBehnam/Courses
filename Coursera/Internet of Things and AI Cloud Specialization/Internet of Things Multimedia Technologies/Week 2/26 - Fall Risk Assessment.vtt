00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.600
One of the projects that we
are working on at UCSD in the context

2
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:12.680
of healthy aging because of
the changing demographics.

3
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:18.366
The baby boomers getting old in US and

4
00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:22.958
one of the consents is falls.

5
00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:28.376
CDC estimated that in 2013 the cost

6
00:00:28.376 --> 00:00:34.300
of falls was $34 billion to the system.

7
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.370
And this is expected to go up
to $55 billion by the year 2020.

8
00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:47.190
And in addition to the economic cost,

9
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.550
the impact to the quality
of life is enormous.

10
00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:57.420
Once a person has the first
fall after the age of 65,

11
00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.100
they're afraid of falling again.

12
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:08.843
Their physical activity gets reduced
which becomes a vicious circle and

13
00:01:08.843 --> 00:01:13.574
the other really stark statistic about

14
00:01:13.574 --> 00:01:18.158
falls is one in four people, 25%,

15
00:01:18.158 --> 00:01:24.910
they have mortality within
the first year of falls.

16
00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:29.770
This is in United States,
in developing countries like India,

17
00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.160
this number could be much more.

18
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:38.870
So this is a very serious concern and
we were puzzling with this problem and

19
00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:45.850
then it occurred to us that we could
use the DVS camera to tackle this.

20
00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.910
So, I think its cause
stating obvious the Inability

21
00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:57.830
to Maintain Postural Balance directly
increases the risk for falls.

22
00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.660
So, if I'm not able to
stand straight like this or

23
00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.970
one foot across other,
or balance on one foot.

24
00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:13.010
All of those are telltale signs
of inability to maintain balance,

25
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.540
and as we grow older,
that gets more and more.

26
00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.450
So the balance is a very,
very complex motor skill

27
00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:28.706
that we master by the age of
one-and-a-half, two years.

28
00:02:28.706 --> 00:02:32.580
And after that,
we don't even think about it.

29
00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:40.430
This is Beckham in 2014,
the game with Dallas Giants.

30
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.900
He had this one handed catch,
I said jumping backwards.

31
00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.120
So we tend to do so
many fantastic things and

32
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.420
maintain balance through
the growing years.

33
00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.610
And by the time they hit 65, 70,

34
00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:02.790
if there greater risk for
falls you can mitigate them very,

35
00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:08.230
very easily just by providing
a very simple prosthetic device or

36
00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.280
special training programs,
so on and so forth.

37
00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:18.840
So the idea is able to detect how
the risk for falls is increasing.
