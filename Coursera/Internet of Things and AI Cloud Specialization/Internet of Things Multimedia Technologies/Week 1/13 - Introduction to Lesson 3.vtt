00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.709
So like in previous courses,
in this lesson we're going to talk

2
00:00:05.709 --> 00:00:10.848
about things that we find that could
be helpful for you to research or

3
00:00:10.848 --> 00:00:16.094
learn or look up and it'll help you
understand the material better.

4
00:00:16.094 --> 00:00:18.718
So we're going to start with
talking about Android Multimedia.

5
00:00:18.718 --> 00:00:23.980
This is because the last course,
we did VOIP in Android,

6
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.440
so this time, we're shifting gears and
we're going to try teaching you

7
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:33.370
how you can develop a multimedia
application in Linux operating system.

8
00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.800
So, we're going to go ahead and talk
about, if you want to stick with Android,

9
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.710
some ways you could implement
a multimedia Android application.

10
00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.960
>> Yeah, then Randy's going to also
talk to you a little bit about C,

11
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.020
a little bit about C++, and.

12
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.610
>> Python.

13
00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:49.370
>> Of course, Python.

14
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:50.940
>> We talked about this before.

15
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.200
So feel free to go back in time and
take a look at those videos.

16
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.110
>> Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

17
00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.618
We have covered all these languages and

18
00:00:59.618 --> 00:01:02.589
please remember that
this is a supplemental.

19
00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:06.570
We're not teaching you Python,
we're not teaching you C.

20
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.390
Please go out there and search for
as many resources as possible.

21
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.920
Check out Amazon buy a book, but

22
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.225
use the opportunity in
between these lessons or

23
00:01:20.225 --> 00:01:25.695
modules to read-up and practice as much
of your coding programming as possible.

24
00:01:25.695 --> 00:01:30.070
So we'll be seeing you in later videos
talk to you about some of this stuff.

25
00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.574
>> Mm-hm.
