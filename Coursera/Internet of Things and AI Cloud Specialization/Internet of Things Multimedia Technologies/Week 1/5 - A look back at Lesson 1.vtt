Hey everyone.

2
00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.400
Now that we've finished going
over all the acronyms and

3
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.250
terminology, let's take a quick look back
at sort of everything you've learned,

4
00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:11.740
which is just a bunch of acronyms and
terminology.

5
00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.260
>> You will have learned as
much as you put into this one.

6
00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.830
Exactly, because I mean,
we kind of just skim through everything.

7
00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.190
But, if you take some time,
go back, read up, check out,

8
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.370
don't forget to check out the links that
we're going to provide you after this

9
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:26.160
because I have some cool little websites

10
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.940
that I got some of this information
from or most of this information from.

11
00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:35.990
I would suggest also skimming through and
just reading as much as possible.

12
00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.180
>> You know, add it to your cheat sheet,
study it, know it well.

13
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.210
>> Yeah.
>> For sure, for sure.

14
00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.910
And I'm pretty sure there's
going to be a lot more that pops up

15
00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.030
when our professor speaks
in the next module.

16
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.840
But until then, we'll see you in the next
lesson, which should be coming up shortly,

17
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:49.420
so thank you.
