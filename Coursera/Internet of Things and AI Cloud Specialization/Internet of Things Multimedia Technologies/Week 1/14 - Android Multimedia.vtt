Hey everyone, so here we're going to start
off talking about Android Multimedia as we

2
00:00:04.275 --> 00:00:05.720
mentioned in the introduction.

3
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:12.840
So, developing an Android Multimedia, it
revolves mainly around these two classes,

4
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.267
the MediaPlayer class and
the AudioManager class.

5
00:00:17.922 --> 00:00:22.090
So, MediaPlayer class,
will handle the audio or

6
00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:27.410
video of your Android device so
you know you'd pass in a file and

7
00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.740
it would use a correct codex
based on the file format,

8
00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.910
if the Android device has
a correct codex otherwise it

9
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.910
would return to error something
like that and then it'll decode it.

10
00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.840
Play it back or whatever you wanted to
do with that audio or video file, and

11
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.410
then that's basically for that class.

12
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.020
And finally, there's the other class is
the AudioManager class, so that is for

13
00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:02.010
the Android device,
only has one speaker, normally.

14
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.370
So the operating system has to
decide what sounds can it play,

15
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:13.310
because if you have, say a YouTube
video and music playing, right?

16
00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.590
And then you got the OS has to somehow
decide, do you want the YouTube video,

17
00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.770
or do you want the the audio
from your music.

18
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.910
So that's where that comes in,
so you'd add it to your program,

19
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.920
make sure your program has
the highest level, and then so

20
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.850
your speakers will be
playing your program's audio.

21
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:33.620
So for example,

22
00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.770
the you wouldn't want some random music
from another application playing.

23
00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.940
You'd want the cell phone or the the
ringtone, if you're being called, playing.

24
00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.460
So that's where this comes in and

25
00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.940
feel free to go back to
the application added in.

26
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.690
And if you guys need extra help,
go ahead and

27
00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.050
check out that link right there
on the developer Android page.

28
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.086
And that'll lead you to the direction
of how to implement and

29
00:01:58.086 --> 00:01:59.679
use these two classes.

30
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.340
>> Well, we'll add that link
at the end of the lesson two.

31
00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.860
>> We'll add that link later on too so
you guys can just easily click it.
