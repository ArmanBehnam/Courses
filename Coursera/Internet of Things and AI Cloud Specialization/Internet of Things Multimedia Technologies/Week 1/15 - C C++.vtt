00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.440
All right, welcome back.

2
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:06.670
So, in this video, we are going
to give you a little refresher on

3
00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.250
the two programming languages, C and C++.

4
00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:14.080
Now, you have seen a little bit
about this in previous courses,

5
00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.580
So kind of going to brush over it and
would recommend you doing

6
00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.150
a little bit of your own research
on Google switch around for

7
00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.335
some more information on C and C++ after
Andy kind of gives you a little breakdown.

8
00:00:25.335 --> 00:00:30.850
>> Yeah, so we're using, we want to talk
about C and C++ because it's very similar

9
00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.040
to one of libraries we are using, since we
are using simple CV for this application,

10
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:42.350
another one is called Open CV, and
Open CV allows you to develop in Android.

11
00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.440
So if you want to mimic our Linux
application that'll be written in Python,

12
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.260
you can use the Android's NDK
to build your own

13
00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.810
OpenCV application with the correct
wrappers and everything.

14
00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:00.480
So couple of refreshers,
C++ is multi-paradigm.

15
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.380
So that means you can make objects or

16
00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.990
you can maybe make procedural calls or
anything like that.

17
00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.510
So it's like a Java language.

18
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.730
It's also like a C so remember,

19
00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:17.000
if you're familiar with using Java,
you might be able to get the hang of C++,

20
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.200
because Java's also
an object oriented language.

21
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.080
The transition shouldn't be too
hard if you're used to writing

22
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.900
Java applications for your Android apps.

23
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.590
And a couple more little, little
properties, it's portable, it's fast

24
00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.730
it's been around for a long time so people
are very good at it, they're used to it.

25
00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.530
Why do you need to change your
own tools when you already have.

26
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.892
>> There a lot of libraries out there.

27
00:01:41.892 --> 00:01:43.720
>> Many libraries out there.

28
00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.170
And I want to mention the NDK
if you guys forgotten about

29
00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.850
it check out Course 2 Module 7.

30
00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.020
We'll explain how you set it up.

31
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.920
We'll give you a little demo application
on how you deploy it to the board and

32
00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.960
remember you can go ahead and
pause the video, look at the slides,

33
00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.880
like Robert mentioned Google around
to learn more and things like that.

34
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.390
And that's basically just wraps up this
little supplemental lesson about C and

35
00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.524
C++.
