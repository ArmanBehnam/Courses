00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:02.910
So Randy, we love libraries, don't we?

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:04.250
>> Yeah, I love to check out books there.

3
00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.690
[LAUGH]
>> Not those kind of libraries.

4
00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:09.140
Yeah, we love libraries.

5
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.700
In general,
if I don't have to write a library and

6
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.360
it's already out there, I think that
it's going to save me a lot of time.

7
00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:24.090
>> Yeah, so all libraries are man-made,
they don't just appear out of nowhere.

8
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.380
Some guy thought, why don't you use this?

9
00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.398
>> Someone made that.
>> Someone made that, we can make it too.

10
00:00:29.398 --> 00:00:30.013
>> Yeah.

11
00:00:30.013 --> 00:00:33.090
>> He didn't believe me though,
[LAUGH] amazingly.

12
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.750
Many times they're open source, so
that means you can just download it and

13
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.660
use it for your own purposes to
create your own applications.

14
00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.689
Sometimes you'll need to actually create
your own libraries because maybe it's some

15
00:00:45.689 --> 00:00:48.776
kind of licensing issues, but
it usually happens if you want to go to

16
00:00:48.776 --> 00:00:52.434
commercial sector where you want to sell
your product or something like that.

17
00:00:52.434 --> 00:00:57.438
>> How much time did we save you by
providing you with our GPIO library?

18
00:00:57.438 --> 00:00:58.760
>> Right.
>> Think about that,

19
00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.819
I know that took us a little bit of time,
not a lot but a little bit of

20
00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:04.956
time to write, so hopefully,
that was able to save you some time.

21
00:01:04.956 --> 00:01:07.778
If it didn't exist,
you would have had to make it.

22
00:01:07.778 --> 00:01:10.600
>> Yeah, that was a great example.

23
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.270
Another one is something we'll be
using later on, it's called Simple CV.

24
00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:21.070
Instead of writing our own computer
vision libraries where we'd have to, say,

25
00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:26.520
control the cameras, take pictures or
be able to detect facial features or

26
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.932
detect color or anything that
to be able to manipulate image.

27
00:01:29.932 --> 00:01:36.800
We'll just download this guy's library,
that he or the person that wrote it and

28
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.446
his team made,
we'll just import those functions and

29
00:01:41.446 --> 00:01:46.600
create our own application that
just uses those functions.

30
00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.195
There we go, we have a really cool and
neat computer vision [CROSSTALK].

31
00:01:52.195 --> 00:01:55.306
>> Yeah, as long as the library and
then your script are in the same folder,

32
00:01:55.306 --> 00:01:57.810
you can just pull off whatever
you want from that library.

33
00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.015
Really nice when you
find the drones you need.

34
00:02:03.015 --> 00:02:05.883
>> [LAUGH]
>> [LAUGH] The drones you're looking for.

35
00:02:05.883 --> 00:02:06.418
>> Yep.

36
00:02:06.418 --> 00:02:08.043
>> It's really nice when you find
the libraries you're looking for.

37
00:02:08.043 --> 00:02:11.235
>> It saves you a bunch of time.

38
00:02:11.235 --> 00:02:13.810
You get straight to production, basically.

39
00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:14.360
>> Of course, yeah.

40
00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.130
That being said, we wish you

41
00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.470
luck in finding any other libraries that
we were not able to provide you with.

42
00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:30.290
Other than that, we will be giving you
links to the libraries that we will be

43
00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.170
using for this nice bare bone application
that we'll be providing you, as well.

44
00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.769
Cool, stay tuned.

45
00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:38.680
This is-
>> The end of the concepts.

46
00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.690
>> This is the end of the concepts, yeah,
so we'll see you in the conclusion.
