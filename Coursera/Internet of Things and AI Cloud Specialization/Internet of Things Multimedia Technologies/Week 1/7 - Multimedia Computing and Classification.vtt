1
00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.170
All right, so
we're going to start with this first

2
00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.590
video on Multimedia Computing and
Classification.

3
00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:09.540
Basically breaking it down, hopefully
breaking it down best possible way.

4
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.180
>> Right.
>> So,

5
00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:16.040
there are four fundamental multimedia
attributes, that I guess you could say.

6
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.980
And if you see the little
link on the bottom,

7
00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.200
I actually got most of
this information from

8
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.830
another slideshow that I found online and
that I just thought was perfect.

9
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.480
So, I was unfortunately unable to use
that, but I took the information and

10
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.140
put it on here.

11
00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.084
So feel free to take that link and
go check that slideshow out as well.

12
00:00:33.084 --> 00:00:34.522
There is more information there.

13
00:00:34.522 --> 00:00:35.920
So yes.

14
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.710
So, you have digitized multimedia.

15
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.020
And what's digitized multimedia?

16
00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:44.140
>> It's where, mentioning how most
pretty much all media formats nowadays,

17
00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.515
or all kinds of media are in
some kind of digital format.

18
00:00:47.515 --> 00:00:48.180
>> Yes.
Yeah.

19
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.262
We're taking analog signals.

20
00:00:50.262 --> 00:00:50.970
>> Yeah.
>> We're

21
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.190
turning them into digital signals.

22
00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:53.660
>> Once upon a time they
were mostly analog.

23
00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.340
>> Yeah.
>> But nowadays,

24
00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.810
>> Everything's pretty digitized.

25
00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:57.560
>> Yeah.
So,

26
00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:05.180
that involves digital signal processing,
lots of other core heavy math and

27
00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.640
programming classes that you might be
interested in taking later on but, yeah.

28
00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.910
So then they're distributed.

29
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:16.420
The distributed media is the information
that is conveyed in remote

30
00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.160
either pre-produced or produced in
real time, distributed over networks.

31
00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.250
Now so can we think about something
that is pre-produced and stored?

32
00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.210
And then can we think of something that's
produced real time and transmitted?

33
00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:29.429
>> So that could be like news, right?

34
00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:31.930
Real time, transmitted, live news.

35
00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:32.930
>> Okay.
Live news.

36
00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:33.670
Yeah, exactly.

37
00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.940
Or maybe a conference call on Skype.

38
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.990
That's also real time produced and
stored and transmitted.

39
00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.415
>> Right.
>> And then maybe something that's

40
00:01:40.415 --> 00:01:42.980
pre-produced and
stored like music on your iPod.

41
00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.520
>> Yeah, or a TV show.

42
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.050
>> A TV show, yeah, there you go.

43
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.780
On your on your HD AT&T recorder,
who knows?

44
00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:50.740
>> [LAUGH] Whatever it is.

45
00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.000
>> Whatever it is.

46
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.720
Then, there's interactive media.

47
00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.720
So, the interactive media is
something that you can control.

48
00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.295
>> Yeah, right.
I find that like a lot of games

49
00:02:01.295 --> 00:02:02.935
tend to be kind of interactive media,
right?

50
00:02:02.935 --> 00:02:03.515
>> There you go.
Yeah.

51
00:02:03.515 --> 00:02:05.635
>> Yeah.
Like maybe you have a PS4 at home or

52
00:02:05.635 --> 00:02:08.425
something, or
an XBox with a Kinect or something.

53
00:02:08.425 --> 00:02:09.085
>> No absolutely.

54
00:02:09.085 --> 00:02:10.685
Perfect.
So there you go, interactive media and

55
00:02:10.685 --> 00:02:11.565
integrated media.

56
00:02:11.565 --> 00:02:17.065
So integrated media, basically is
bunch of different kinds of media

57
00:02:17.065 --> 00:02:20.185
put together, but
that can be controlled independently.

58
00:02:20.185 --> 00:02:25.200
So I guess how can we maybe
think of an example for that

59
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.506
>> Because you can also use games again.

60
00:02:26.506 --> 00:02:27.720
>> Yeah.

61
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.720
>> Maybe games or
the XBox one control center.

62
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:34.690
Something like that.

63
00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.560
Where you have all of
your medias together,

64
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.730
you have your Netflix applications,
you have your game applications,

65
00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.320
you have all this stuff,
all these different medias,

66
00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.990
they're put together, But
you can control them independently.

67
00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:45.150
All right, cool.

68
00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.025
So that being said,
let's check out what else we got here.

69
00:02:48.025 --> 00:02:48.750
Classifications.

70
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.600
Different types of media or multimedia.

71
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.190
>> Yeah, you mentioned this before
in the first lesson, right?

72
00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.800
So.
>> Yeah,

73
00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.210
I was trying to rattle them off the top of
my head, but here they are on the slide.

74
00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:01.900
So you have text, which would be
kind of like Instant messaging.

75
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.140
>> Yeah.
>> Sending it through

76
00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.920
your cell phone network, through
the internet, through your Facebook,

77
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:06.870
through whatever you're using.

78
00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:07.640
>> Yes, whatever.

79
00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.209
>> Audio, voice calls, that's all
types of multimedia audio, mp3s,

80
00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:13.968
music, whatever you got.

81
00:03:13.968 --> 00:03:16.340
Midis up there is an example.

82
00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:17.650
>> Yes.
Still images and videos.

83
00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:18.910
The camera.

84
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.600
Tons of still images, or tons of videos.

85
00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.510
>> Just a simple picture.

86
00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:23.490
Yeah.
>> Right.

87
00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:25.720
>> Then, you know, millions of pictures or

88
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:31.050
thousands of pictures put together and
unseemingly looking like a video.

89
00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.970
And then graphics, which is essentially
an image created by a computer, or

90
00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.730
a computer generated image.

91
00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.410
And then animation,
a sequence of graphics.

92
00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.380
Great.
>> It's just like video graphics.

93
00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.880
>> Yeah.

94
00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.280
All right, cool.

95
00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.750
Going a little deeper.

96
00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.850
There are two different kinds
of media when looking at

97
00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.670
either being static or dynamic.

98
00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.620
Now, we take what we just
talked about in the last slide.

99
00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.660
You have an image and
then you have a video, right?

100
00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.565
So the image would be the static
version or the discrete media.

101
00:04:03.565 --> 00:04:06.180
>> Right.
>> And then the video would be the dynamic

102
00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.170
or the continuous media.

103
00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.560
I would suggest searching these things.

104
00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:18.490
If you want to learn more about this
kind of stuff, I mean it's more,

105
00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:23.810
it's just all concepts that
they're just fun to know about.

106
00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.850
They will also help you kind of critically
think your way through your applications

107
00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:27.810
later on when you're developing.

108
00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.870
All right.

109
00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:30.740
>> Last slide here?

110
00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:31.800
>> Yes.

111
00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.810
So, system implications.

112
00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:39.380
Now you can kind of see what's required,

113
00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:44.150
I guess, in hardware sense,
in a software sense, of your system or

114
00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.930
I guess, what are you forced to deal

115
00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.710
with when you decide to take on these
multimedia applications or jobs?

116
00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:59.280
Now, so you're going to want to be pretty
good at coding, compressing, digitization.

117
00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.040
So your team might want to have
someone that's good at digital

118
00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.820
signal processing working with programs,

119
00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:10.590
such as MATLAB, that allow you to create
filters, working with stuff like that.

120
00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:11.810
You're going to need a lot of storage.

121
00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:12.920
Multimedia, in general,

122
00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.440
especially uncompressed multimedia,
requires a lot of storage.

123
00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.070
>> Yeah.
>> I know even in this studio.

124
00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.780
>> Yeah.

125
00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:23.580
They're doing an AV work,
terabytes of freaking space factor.

126
00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:28.230
>> If you ever try to put in a Blu ray
movie unto your computer something,

127
00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:29.882
it gets like 30 plus gigs.

128
00:05:29.882 --> 00:05:31.890
>> Yeah, absolutely.

129
00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:33.180
Processing power.

130
00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:37.120
So you're going to need a lot processing
power when dealing with multimedia.

131
00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.933
I mean even the most
hardcore games out there.

132
00:05:41.933 --> 00:05:44.416
>> BBVGV view right?

133
00:05:44.416 --> 00:05:50.160
>> They don't even hold a candle to
these rendering programs that a lot

134
00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.710
of the audio video multimedia specialists
have to use, engineers have to use.

135
00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:57.680
>> If any of you have dab into
video editing or anything,

136
00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.230
you notice you need tons of RAM or

137
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:05.490
maybe some a lot of processing power
to be able to export your edited file.

138
00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:06.120
>> Yeah.

139
00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:10.070
Understanding, I know we're kind of
dribbling through these, but

140
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:14.070
understanding, so speech, object
recognition kind of goes into the computer

141
00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:15.330
vision that Randy was talking about.

142
00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:18.780
Something that we're hoping to touch on
later on in this course where we build

143
00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:25.040
a demo as these scripts and
algorithms get better and better,

144
00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:31.930
we are able to execute more

145
00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:37.550
robust object detection and
more robust voice detection.

146
00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:41.730
So, actually we have some examples
I think maybe in the next video.

147
00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:45.530
But you'll get to see some really
cool things that people had made with

148
00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:49.750
these computer vision and
object detection.

149
00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:51.520
And then production.

150
00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:55.530
So, there's more complex authoring and
user innovate software.

151
00:06:55.530 --> 00:07:00.970
So all of these stuff,
you can imagine just eats up your system.

152
00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:03.760
You're going to need a very
powerful system to work

153
00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:06.870
with some intense multimedia applications.

154
00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:09.480
Presentation of your application.

155
00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:15.256
You're going to deal with the user
perception, so front-end back-end stuff.

156
00:07:15.256 --> 00:07:17.220
>> Right.
Like I've mentioned before.

157
00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:17.720
>> Yeah.

158
00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:23.000
Protection, media encryption,
copyright, privacy.

159
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.830
These are all things that you find
out more find on the website there.

160
00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:28.380
I would recommend checking it out.

161
00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:32.840
But again, all system implications
of the multimedia process.

162
00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:37.240
Distribution, delivering the multimedia,
broadcasting multimedia,

163
00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:41.290
communication, transmitting
multimedia over a network,

164
00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:46.770
over the internet,
how is your multimedia being transmitted?

165
00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:50.230
But yeah, anyways, so,
I know this was a long video.

166
00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:51.156
Hopefully, you're still paying attention.

167
00:07:51.156 --> 00:07:52.515
[LAUGH]
>> [LAUGH]

168
00:07:52.515 --> 00:07:53.363
>> We look forward.

169
00:07:53.363 --> 00:07:53.930
>> You understand.

170
00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:55.240
>> It, it's going to get more exciting.

171
00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:56.040
>> Yep.
>> Yeah.

172
00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:58.130
