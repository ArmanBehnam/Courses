00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:01.516
Hello all.

2
00:00:01.516 --> 00:00:07.636
Welcome to the specialization
on the Internet of things.

3
00:00:07.636 --> 00:00:09.487
The Internet of things,

4
00:00:09.487 --> 00:00:15.100
our viewpoint is reach the convergence
of multiple technologies.

5
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.390
We will talk about telephony networks,
circuitry switch.

6
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.190
And, a lot of innovations give rise
to broadcast radio and television.

7
00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:30.060
And, that, in turn, led to consumer
electronics and the growth of content.

8
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.970
Around this time, 1972, DARPA commissioned

9
00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:41.870
the development of Internet to do one
thing that could not be done with

10
00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.950
the telephony networks and
the broadcast networks at that time.

11
00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.110
That is reliability.

12
00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:54.690
And, as we all know, Internet delivered
on reliability and went on to subsume

13
00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.520
the functionality of telephony networks,
And broadcast networks.

14
00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:06.600
So, the next big converging technology was

15
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.300
wireless technologies and that gave us
wireless internet and the smartphones.

16
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:18.501
And, in this course, we are going
to use the smartphone platform

17
00:01:18.501 --> 00:01:24.613
to teach you the Internet of things and
what the future might be.

18
00:01:24.613 --> 00:01:30.202
The iOT platform, the indications
are it will gives us new products and

19
00:01:30.202 --> 00:01:36.092
services in this place of automotive
industry, healthcare, robotics.

20
00:01:36.092 --> 00:01:40.631
The unique thing about this course,
these series of courses,

21
00:01:40.631 --> 00:01:44.650
is it's completely hands-on and
lab oriented.

22
00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:50.650
And, I would like Ganz Chukalingum to come
and introduce the lab parts about that.

23
00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.170
Hello Ganz, come on in.

24
00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.490
Hey, thanks Artie.

25
00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.850
Hey guys, you're probably all looking to
take this course because you're interested

26
00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.940
in building your own Internet of things.

27
00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.480
And, I think you've come
to the right place.

28
00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.060
This is going to be really hands-on.

29
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.540
Most of the courses here
are built by the students of UCSD.

30
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.400
You're going to be working with this
Arrow Electronics DragonBoard 410c,

31
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.552
which runs the Qualcomm Snapdragon
processor.

32
00:02:14.552 --> 00:02:17.960
This is, you can think of it like
if you take out your smartphone,

33
00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.040
open up the hood.

34
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.610
What you'll find is components in here.

35
00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.740
So, this will form the core of our course.

36
00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.780
To follow along, you would buy one
of these, which is not a big deal.

37
00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.400
It's not that expensive.

38
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.890
But, I want to pause here and
give you a snapshot of what you're

39
00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.510
going to experience
throughout this course.

40
00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.776
You're going to see some of the lab
projects you'll be building.

41
00:02:37.776 --> 00:02:42.546
And, after that, you finally end up with
the capstone project where you'll create

42
00:02:42.546 --> 00:02:45.447
your own ideas, and
build on it using affordency.

43
00:02:45.447 --> 00:02:50.844
Anyway, I'll leave now, give a little

44
00:02:50.844 --> 00:02:57.830
trailer of what you'll
experience in this course,

45
00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.130
and hope to see you in course 1.

46
00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:12.130
[MUSIC]

47
00:03:20.678 --> 00:03:21.250
Hey, guys.
I want

48
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.730
to introduce you to the rest of
the team that made the MOOC possible.

49
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.280
I wanted to start with Robert here,
but before that,

50
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.890
I want to say there's two students I'm
missing here, Randy and Ukeridge, but

51
00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.780
you'll get to see them later
throughout the course.

52
00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.860
Start with the chief of students, Robert?

53
00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:35.390
Thanks, Ganz.

54
00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.070
Yeah, I'm Robert Wolf.

55
00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.224
I just recently graduated here, at UCSD,
with electrical engineering, and

56
00:03:40.224 --> 00:03:43.161
I look forward to meeting everyone
throughout these courses coming up.

57
00:03:43.161 --> 00:03:47.072
I'm Eric Uro, I'm a grad student in
the EC department, here at UCSD,

58
00:03:47.072 --> 00:03:49.366
and I'm here to teach guys some parkour.

59
00:03:49.366 --> 00:03:50.923
Just kidding, we're here for electronics.

60
00:03:50.923 --> 00:03:54.627
[LAUGH] My name's Jacob Torado,
I'm a third year here,

61
00:03:54.627 --> 00:04:00.260
studying computer science at UCSD And,
I'm ready for the course.

62
00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:02.430
And i'm Arger Malkun.

63
00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.940
I'm also a third year at USCD,
doing computer engineering, and

64
00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.710
I'm going to have a great time
doing these courses with you guys.

65
00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:11.948
And finally,
want to introduce you to the video crew,

66
00:04:11.948 --> 00:04:13.600
which made the whole course possible.

67
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.109
Hector, Alex, Joe,
please come in and say hi.

68
00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:18.475
[APPLAUSE] Do a little selfie of yourself.

69
00:04:18.475 --> 00:04:21.680
[LAUGH] Hopefully,
we'll see you guys in course one.

70
00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.260
Please come back.
