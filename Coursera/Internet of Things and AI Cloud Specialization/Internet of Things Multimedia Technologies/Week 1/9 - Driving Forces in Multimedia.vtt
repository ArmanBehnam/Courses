WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.970
So what drives this multimedia
train into the future

2
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.329
applications that we will
end up seeing in the future?

3
00:00:10.329 --> 00:00:12.244
>> [LAUGH]
>> So

4
00:00:12.244 --> 00:00:16.953
let's take a look at some
of the driving forces

5
00:00:16.953 --> 00:00:21.620
that are kind of taking us into-
>> What's basically pushing multimedia

6
00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:24.479
forward and-
>> Yeah, to the next era.

7
00:00:24.479 --> 00:00:28.251
So you have an evolution in technology and
data networks.

8
00:00:28.251 --> 00:00:30.797
So the increasing
availability of bandwidth and

9
00:00:30.797 --> 00:00:33.960
I guess I'm kind of reading it but
I'm saying it too.

10
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.279
That the increasing availability in
bandwidth on demand in the office, home,

11
00:00:40.279 --> 00:00:46.618
road, etc., we have higher speed,
higher data, higher speed data modems.

12
00:00:46.618 --> 00:00:49.892
I mean, what we went-
>> I'm pretty sure everyone remembers DSL.

13
00:00:49.892 --> 00:00:57.200
>> 56K, I remember I had a 56K modem and
I wouldn't even get a 56K connection.

14
00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.660
So I would connect to the Internet and
even though my modem was 56K,

15
00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.340
I would end up with 12K connection.

16
00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:08.700
It took me, I don't know, a couple of
minutes to load an image sometimes,

17
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.995
or I think I spent four days trying
to download a Gorillaz video.

18
00:01:13.995 --> 00:01:16.962
>> [LAUGH]
>> Gorillaz, the band.

19
00:01:16.962 --> 00:01:22.050
Anyways, so the speed of our
Internet is just outrageously fast.

20
00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.540
Google Fiber is hopefully
coming to San Diego.

21
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.397
We'll see.

22
00:01:25.397 --> 00:01:28.956
>> [LAUGH]
>> But Google Fiber is threatening to give

23
00:01:28.956 --> 00:01:31.110
us gigabytes at a time-
>> Right

24
00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.300
>> Of speed.

25
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.570
That right there alone is just showing so
much promise for

26
00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.000
the multimedia developer because
now you have access to these speeds

27
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.252
which would of otherwise at
one point been a limitation.

28
00:01:46.252 --> 00:01:51.590
>> Maybe you can upload more longer videos
at a better rate, instead of waiting,

29
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.020
letting computer sit overnight to
download or upload a video to YouTube, or

30
00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.772
something like that.

31
00:01:55.772 --> 00:01:58.151
>> Yeah, of course, of course.

32
00:01:58.151 --> 00:02:01.575
So also the widespread
availability of Internet.

33
00:02:01.575 --> 00:02:04.320
I mean,
you're not limited to your house anymore.

34
00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.538
You have your cell phone networks,
you have hotspots, you have coffee shops.

35
00:02:08.538 --> 00:02:11.592
The Internet is everywhere.

36
00:02:11.592 --> 00:02:13.260
In every sense of the word,
it's everywhere.

37
00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.858
It's just the world wide web is
accessible in the whole world.

38
00:02:18.858 --> 00:02:22.515
>> [LAUGH]
>> Yeah.

39
00:02:22.515 --> 00:02:25.979
Another limitation that has
been completely thrown away,

40
00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:28.690
no longer limited to
where you have Internet.

41
00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.340
It's kind of everywhere now.

42
00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.860
Fast processors,
the speed of processing has gone up,

43
00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.320
I think based on Moore's law,
we're supposed to

44
00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.360
increase our speeds by double every
18 months, I think that's what it is.

45
00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.322
>> That sounds about right.

46
00:02:44.322 --> 00:02:49.350
>> Yeah, so I mean the limitations

47
00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.940
of speed are also being, those boundaries
are being pushed every 18 months.

48
00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.548
Every six months I feel like a new
processor comes out, it's ridiculous so

49
00:02:57.548 --> 00:03:01.480
new algorithms everything's
getting more robust.

50
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.670
Everything's getting written better.

51
00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.590
You're having better tools to use.

52
00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.260
People are out there and they're
all contributing to the same thing.

53
00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.640
So like we've been talking about
libraries, why re-invent something.

54
00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.750
Someone puts a library out there, you get
to now use this library which means you

55
00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.690
didn't have to spend the time
building that library.

56
00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.585
>> Even if someone comes up like a really
cool compression of them say like

57
00:03:20.585 --> 00:03:21.723
the Hookman compression.

58
00:03:21.723 --> 00:03:24.827
Why would you need to come up with your
own compression algorithm when this one

59
00:03:24.827 --> 00:03:25.720
works just as well?

60
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:26.790
Works amazing.

61
00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.874
>> Absolutely, and
I'm going to butcher this quote, but

62
00:03:29.874 --> 00:03:32.621
it was Isaac Newton,
the creator of calculus.

63
00:03:32.621 --> 00:03:37.288
I would have not achieved what I had
achieved had I not stood on the shoulders

64
00:03:37.288 --> 00:03:38.590
of giants.

65
00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:39.320
Something like that.

66
00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.790
Anyways, everyone's putting stuff
out there, might as well utilize it.

67
00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.140
You'll get way further.

68
00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.030
You'll be able to utilize your time.

69
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:48.510
>> More efficiently.

70
00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:49.430
>> More efficiently, yeah,

71
00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.310
if you take advantage of all
the tools that are out there now.

72
00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.970
So yeah, anyways, two more things here.

73
00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:57.700
Smart terminals, digital phones.

74
00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.650
We've gone over all this stuff
when we did our VoIP course.

75
00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.548
We've talked about it I think
throughout the specialization.

76
00:04:03.548 --> 00:04:08.840
You have all these different
hardware sets that you can

77
00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:14.030
get that are allowing you
to just expand completely.

78
00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.930
I mean, look,
we have our DragonBoard 410C here.

79
00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.292
I mean, I would have never dreamed to
see a computer this small even just

80
00:04:21.292 --> 00:04:24.797
five years ago, ten years ago,
this powerful at least.

81
00:04:24.797 --> 00:04:27.585
This small and this powerful,
I mean it's amazing, and

82
00:04:27.585 --> 00:04:31.430
they just keep getting smaller and
they keep getting more powerful.

83
00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:37.220
And this can be used as a terminal to
call people with, it's just amazing.

84
00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.290
>> Rick,
as you mentioned in the last course,

85
00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.660
making your home smarter,
things like that.

86
00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:42.490
>> Yeah.

87
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.500
And then,
the digitization of all of your devices.

88
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.440
So just the ability that,
you used to have a analog phone,

89
00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.220
now you have a digital phone.

90
00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.420
I mean, that's an example right there.

91
00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:00.120
Every single thing, a microphone alone,
it's taking an analog signal,

92
00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.708
turning it into a digital signal so
you can record stuff.

93
00:05:03.708 --> 00:05:07.390
It's everywhere.

94
00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.220
The forces,
the driving forces of multimedia.

95
00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.280
There you go, you have some of the main
ones, I'm sure there's more out data you

96
00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:18.050
can think of something that that's pushing
these, your ability to develop multimedia

97
00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:23.180
applications, pushing it even further and
allowing breaking down the limitations and

98
00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:28.478
all the barriers that would have
have otherwise construed you before.

99
00:05:28.478 --> 00:05:32.700
So yeah, it's cool,
hopefully you enjoyed this and again,

100
00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.710
you should probably check
out that website down there.

101
00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.080
We will provide you with links at the end.

102
00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.270
And we'll see you in the next video.
