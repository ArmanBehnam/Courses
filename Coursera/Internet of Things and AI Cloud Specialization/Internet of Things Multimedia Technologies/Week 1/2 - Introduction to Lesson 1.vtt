Hello, everyone, and
welcome back to the Internet of

2
00:00:04.284 --> 00:00:09.627
Things Specialization here at UCSD,
focusing on the DragonBoard 410z.

3
00:00:09.627 --> 00:00:16.339
We'd like to welcome you once again to
an acronyms and terminology lesson, right?

4
00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:17.778
>> Mm-hm, yeah.
>> So always fun, and

5
00:00:17.778 --> 00:00:22.233
I don't know if you've noticed, but we got
a nice little different background here

6
00:00:22.233 --> 00:00:25.316
this time so to celebrate kind of-
>> Yeah, last one.

7
00:00:25.316 --> 00:00:27.910
>> Yeah, it's kind of our last lesson for
the Capstone, yeah.

8
00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.480
So anyways, what are we going to cover
in the acronym and terminology lesson?

9
00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.635
We are going to cover acronyms and
terminology.

10
00:00:34.635 --> 00:00:36.125
>> [LAUGH] What a surprise.

11
00:00:36.125 --> 00:00:37.030
>> Yeah, what a surprise.

12
00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.278
So just like every other course before
this, at least two through four.

13
00:00:41.278 --> 00:00:45.125
We kind of walked you through a bunch of
the acronyms that we would like you to

14
00:00:45.125 --> 00:00:50.520
maybe get familiar with,
because as you walk through the later

15
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.460
lessons and modules in this course, you're
going to kind of be confronted with.

16
00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.040
>> Yeah.
Like, give you a little

17
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.800
heads up on the terminology that comes up.

18
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.549
So when we say something, you're not
totally confused and not to like,

19
00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:02.179
to pause the video or
look it up right away.

20
00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:02.809
>> Yeah, of course.

21
00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:07.402
So,we'll probably ask you to make a cheat
sheet just like we have in earlier

22
00:01:07.402 --> 00:01:08.180
courses.

23
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.310
And hopefully, you kind of take
care of that and have some fun.

24
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.720
So all right, let's get going.

25
00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.080
Right, see you in the later videos.
