1
00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:02.460
Bring on the acronyms.

2
00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.630
So we are ready to kind of look at
this huge list of things you might or

3
00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:12.900
might not see throughout the remainder
of this particular course on multimedia.

4
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.700
>> Yeah, just a bunch of things we find
sort of may be important, relevant.

5
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.632
So first off, we got CV,
which is computer vision.

6
00:00:18.632 --> 00:00:23.308
That's an important term for
this course because something will be

7
00:00:23.308 --> 00:00:27.984
implementing later on and
application will be showing you guys, so

8
00:00:27.984 --> 00:00:33.070
what a CVC is just simply the concept
by processing or analyzing an image to

9
00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:38.017
get some kind of data, or make that
decision, or something like that.

10
00:00:38.017 --> 00:00:42.301
>> Yeah, and we could go down this list
one by one, but I think it's better for

11
00:00:42.301 --> 00:00:46.653
you maybe to take some time, pause it,
read up on some of these things, some

12
00:00:46.653 --> 00:00:51.890
of these acronyms, and I don't know, get a
little familiar with some of these terms.

13
00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.012
And even go search for some of them and

14
00:00:55.012 --> 00:01:00.878
find out a little bit more about them
if they seem interesting to you.

15
00:01:00.878 --> 00:01:03.105
There's, I think, three or four pages
of these, so let's check it out.

16
00:01:03.105 --> 00:01:04.555
What else so we've got-
>> We've got a couple of them.

17
00:01:04.555 --> 00:01:07.035
>> Yeah, instant messaging,
I mean pretty self explanatory.

18
00:01:07.035 --> 00:01:10.560
I'm pretty sure most of you participate
in an instant message or two everyday.

19
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.821
>> [LAUGH]
>> Either through the cellular networks,

20
00:01:13.821 --> 00:01:16.561
through the Internet, Wi-Fi, whatever or

21
00:01:16.561 --> 00:01:20.609
whatever it is that you're
transmitting your messages through.

22
00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:22.460
That's a form of multimedia.

23
00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.300
So MIDI,

24
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:29.580
used in a lot of recording studios
emulating musical instruments, etc.

25
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.060
You can look up more stuff like that.

26
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.560
Video telephony, conference calls,
things such as Skype.

27
00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.860
Even though it's a VOIP service,
it's also a multimedia service.

28
00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:48.504
So you're getting video transmission and
audio video transmissions.

29
00:01:48.504 --> 00:01:50.950
Then you can pause, check this out.

30
00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.770
Now, I pulled these from a website
that I will provide you with.

31
00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.540
So let's take a look at
the next one right here.

32
00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.100
DSP solution,
digital signal processing, done a lot.

33
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.034
Standard RGB, standard red, green, blue.

34
00:02:04.034 --> 00:02:05.140
Read a little bit about that.

35
00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.750
But yeah, I pulled this from
a website like I was saying

36
00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.610
I will provide you with that link.

37
00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.450
There are hundreds of these terms and

38
00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.700
acronyms that I will suggest you go and
take a look at.

39
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.767
Again, take the ones that you
feel are most interesting,

40
00:02:21.767 --> 00:02:27.162
put them on your cheat sheet, maybe think
about what you find interesting and

41
00:02:27.162 --> 00:02:29.744
want to add to the application later.

42
00:02:29.744 --> 00:02:30.884
>> Yeah.

43
00:02:30.884 --> 00:02:33.888
Maybe you find say, I don't know,

44
00:02:33.888 --> 00:02:38.804
you wanted to implement some
kind of a streaming utility.

45
00:02:38.804 --> 00:02:41.385
[CROSSTALK] Like remember in
the previously in the VOIP we made

46
00:02:41.385 --> 00:02:44.538
an application, but when you call
somebody it didn't ring up anything.

47
00:02:44.538 --> 00:02:47.481
Meaning this could have multimedia,
add some sound effects and a ringtones,

48
00:02:47.481 --> 00:02:48.338
something like that.

49
00:02:48.338 --> 00:02:50.605
>> Using media.
Here you go.

50
00:02:50.605 --> 00:02:51.145
All right, cool.

51
00:02:51.145 --> 00:02:54.035
So anyways have some fun
with these acronyms.

52
00:02:54.035 --> 00:02:57.225
Start up your Chichi now and
we'll see the next video.
