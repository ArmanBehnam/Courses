00:00:00.501 --> 00:00:03.320
All right, Randy,
well that was a pretty full

2
00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.740
lesson there that we got
a chance to look at.

3
00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.508
It's time to summarize
everything we went over.

4
00:00:08.508 --> 00:00:09.736
>> Everything.

5
00:00:09.736 --> 00:00:10.731
>> Everything, everything.

6
00:00:10.731 --> 00:00:13.560
>> [LAUGH]
>> We started off by going over

7
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.630
multimedia, the classification
of multimedia.

8
00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.293
What is it?

9
00:00:19.293 --> 00:00:21.886
Taking in some of the elements of it and

10
00:00:21.886 --> 00:00:26.527
the different types of multimedia
>> Yeah, after that, we went over some

11
00:00:26.527 --> 00:00:31.540
important things to multimedia and
also why is it important in our world.

12
00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:36.420
It's a huge factor, everyone interacts
with it in some way, shape or form.

13
00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.660
>> It is so
important that there are teams and

14
00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.460
huge companies that
are constantly working to make

15
00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.680
development in multimedia better, a better
experience and easier for everyone.

16
00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.610
The driving forces behind multimedia,
we kind of talked about that,

17
00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.030
as well as some example applications.

18
00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.040
>> Yeah, ways to apply multimedia,
what kind of things

19
00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.570
you can create,
knowing everything about multimedia.

20
00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.030
>> Yeah, yeah, and then the libraries.

21
00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.130
We talked about
the importance of looking for

22
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.420
a library before deciding I'm
just going to write this myself.

23
00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.130
Even though it's a good experience,
don't get me wrong.

24
00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.370
If you get a chance to
write some libraries,

25
00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.030
go for it, but
no sense in reinventing the wheel.

26
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.340
Always a good idea to go search for
a library, if it's unlicensed,

27
00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.300
or if you're able to use it,
then give it a shot.

28
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.100
Maybe modify it a little bit, make it
better, more robust, do what you can.

29
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.890
>> Remember, libraries are just tools.

30
00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.480
You just need to select the right
tools that suits your needs.

31
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.510
If a library or the tool doesn't
suit your needs, go ahead,

32
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.680
jump into creating your own functions.

33
00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.000
>> Yeah, yeah.

34
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.920
Great, well said.

35
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.200
Perfect, so then we will close
out this lesson with a thank you.

36
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.740
We look forward to seeing you in the next
lesson, where we will talk about some

37
00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.490
supplemental materials that should help
you throughout the rest of the course.
