00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:02.950
Yeah, so Python time, right?

2
00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:08.280
You have plenty of this code already
in your Dragon Board 410 C, or

3
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.230
we've provided it to you on our Git.

4
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.540
But we want to kind of cover
it a little bit more or

5
00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:21.120
again, I guess I should say for those of
you who would like another refresher.

6
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:26.230
>> Yeah, since the last course
we're focusing on Java and Android.

7
00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.150
So this time, a little supplemental
lesson about Python, just in case you've

8
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.690
forgotten since we were working
in the Linux operating system.

9
00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.660
So as mentioned before,
it's highly readable, general purpose,

10
00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.900
kind of simpler syntax
compared to other languages.

11
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:48.817
It's known as a scripting language, so
it's just line-by-line, does everything

12
00:00:48.817 --> 00:00:54.178
and, well, so it supports multiple
programming paradigms just like C++.

13
00:00:54.178 --> 00:00:58.499
You can make it object orienting language,
procedural language,

14
00:00:58.499 --> 00:01:01.077
or just create script that'll automate

15
00:01:01.077 --> 00:01:05.498
some kind of processes like logging
into a remote system or whatnot.

16
00:01:05.498 --> 00:01:10.190
And we want to talk about why we chose
Python, because obviously, it's simple,

17
00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.739
it's not too hard to teach, and
it's pretty cool making your own programs.

18
00:01:14.739 --> 00:01:20.210
But the biggest reason is
because there are SimpleCV and

19
00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:26.230
OpenCV libraries for Python, so
we'll be able to create our applications

20
00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:32.160
in Python instead of C,
which is much better for many people.

21
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.980
And like we said, there's a ton of
documentation, many teaching resources.

22
00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.530
Go ahead, feel free to go back, and

23
00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.490
I believe we did talk about
Python in course two.

24
00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.090
>> Well, we've talked about
Python in several of the courses.

25
00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.830
In fact, there was a video,
I think, where me and

26
00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.930
Eric just kind of I talked about Python,
our favorite IDE.

27
00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.390
We'll be using IDLE 3 again,
I think, in this one, right?

28
00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.510
>> It's up to the user.

29
00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:02.988
I personally like Vim,
which is just a text editor.

30
00:02:02.988 --> 00:02:05.962
>> Great, yeah, so yeah,
you can get Vim app, get it and

31
00:02:05.962 --> 00:02:08.308
install Vim if it's not already on there.

32
00:02:08.308 --> 00:02:12.728
But the battle of the development.

33
00:02:12.728 --> 00:02:15.128
[LAUGH]
>> Don't worry about the Linux OS stuff.

34
00:02:15.128 --> 00:02:18.208
If you're not familiar with that, we'll
be talking about that in a later module.

35
00:02:18.208 --> 00:02:22.830
So sit tight, stay tuned, and
we'll see you in the next video.
