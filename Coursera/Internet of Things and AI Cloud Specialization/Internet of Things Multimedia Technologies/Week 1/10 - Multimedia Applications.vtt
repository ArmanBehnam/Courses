00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:00.990
Hey, everyone!
Now,

2
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:04.920
you've seen some things like multimedia
importance, and what's pushing it, so

3
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.010
let's check out how we can apply
multimedia to your own applications,

4
00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:11.240
your own homes, whatever you want.

5
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.058
>> Yeah, of course.

6
00:00:12.058 --> 00:00:16.167
So, like Randy said,
we're going to talk about some examples,

7
00:00:16.167 --> 00:00:16.977
>> But first,

8
00:00:16.977 --> 00:00:20.947
just what are some of
the requirements needed, at least,

9
00:00:20.947 --> 00:00:26.750
that differentiate multimedia development
to other types of development.

10
00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:32.150
In general,
I put some specs up here, stuff that

11
00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:38.050
if you would like, you can go search more,
find out more about absolute

12
00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.160
specifications that you might need for the
particular development you'll be doing.

13
00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.360
However, in general,
I do know that you can go to,

14
00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.230
I think it's bullet point 4 and 5.

15
00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:48.355
When you're developing multimedia,

16
00:00:48.355 --> 00:00:52.110
and I think we mentioned this,
you're going to want more storage space.

17
00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.150
It just goes without saying an image
takes up a certain amount of space, and

18
00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.280
thousands of images
takes up a lot of space.

19
00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.040
You're doing a video.

20
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.000
You want HD video.

21
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.280
We have 4K video now.

22
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.780
All of these things, especially with
current compression techniques, and

23
00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.140
hopefully they get better,
still take up a lot of space.

24
00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.800
And, that's just something that
we can't get around right now.

25
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.500
So if you're developing multimedia,
you need a lot of space.

26
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.890
Also main memory, there's a lot of tasks
that are going on at the same time.

27
00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:26.110
You going to need that memory
to keep it performing.

28
00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.643
>> It's always good to
have secondary storage.

29
00:01:30.643 --> 00:01:34.980
I think I mentioned the AV
studio that we're at here.

30
00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.210
They have tonnes of storage back there.

31
00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:43.130
I hear them talking about moving around
terabytes and terabytes of storage space.

32
00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:44.740
It goes with the territory.

33
00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.130
So, when you're working with multimedia,
especially video and audio,

34
00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.220
you need to keep that in mind.

35
00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.094
All right, so [CROSSTALK]
>> Let's call it something like more

36
00:01:56.094 --> 00:01:58.300
practical application, right?

37
00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.830
>> Yeah, yeah.

38
00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.300
>> I mean no, or are these more specs?

39
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.900
>> Yeah, well, a little bit more specs.

40
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:08.160
So, all of these components,
all of these hardware

41
00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.180
specs that we're talking about that
help drive your multimedia development,

42
00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.760
ultimately help, also,
your real-time performance requirements.

43
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.171
So, anyways,
you can take a look at this slide.

44
00:02:23.171 --> 00:02:27.450
There's not much on here, but I would
recommend just pausing it, reading through

45
00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:33.440
it, and I'm actually excited more to
talk about the example applications.

46
00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.780
>> Yeah, the more practical
versions we have in store.

47
00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.433
>> Yeah, so let's check out some
stuff that you can think of.

48
00:02:40.433 --> 00:02:44.752
And, I would recommend paying close
attention to all of these examples here,

49
00:02:44.752 --> 00:02:47.633
so that when we go into
developing our application,

50
00:02:47.633 --> 00:02:50.390
you can think of stuff you
might want to add on to it.

51
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.056
>> Of course, just like last time,

52
00:02:52.056 --> 00:02:54.910
we're going to have a relatively
bare bones application,

53
00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.018
introducing you to the software, how to
start programming and developing in it.

54
00:02:59.018 --> 00:03:03.223
And, then it's up to you and
the community to add all the meat, or

55
00:03:03.223 --> 00:03:05.529
the cool features, you want to it.

56
00:03:05.529 --> 00:03:07.189
>> Yeah, yeah, so all right.

57
00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:08.920
So, let's take some examples here, right?

58
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.410
We have a residential area,
your house for example, right?

59
00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:13.300
>> Yeah, a smart home.

60
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.639
What kind of stuff what you use,
multimedia-wise in your house, right?

61
00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:22.377
The first thing that we've got
up there Video-On-Demand, right?

62
00:03:22.377 --> 00:03:26.116
So, you have your Apple TV, right?

63
00:03:26.116 --> 00:03:27.860
Or, you have your RoKu.

64
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.600
Chromecast.

65
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.700
>> Or, RoKu, or you have your Chromecast,
or you have your cable box that allows

66
00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.780
you to record digital shows, set up your
timers, and record your favorite shows.

67
00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.265
Home shopping, you're able to buy stuff.

68
00:03:44.265 --> 00:03:47.230
[LAUGH] Pretty much anything you want,
now.

69
00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.250
Even Amazon has that 2 hour delivery,
Amazon Now.

70
00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.300
Your video phones,
conferencing through Skype.

71
00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.010
I've said this a bunch of times.

72
00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.190
But, some good at-home applications,
and these aren't all of them.

73
00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.960
There's so many more, and there's probably
stuff that no one's thought of yet, so

74
00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:03.846
there you go.

75
00:04:03.846 --> 00:04:07.532
Businesses services, corporate education.

76
00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:14.010
You have stuff like Coursera
that you're on right now,

77
00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.504
pretty sure that's used for
educational purposes, right?

78
00:04:16.504 --> 00:04:21.930
>> [LAUGH]
>> Yeah so, there you go.

79
00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.590
Education in general, right?

80
00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:24.990
You have digital libraries now.

81
00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.410
You used to have to go check out a book.

82
00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.064
You can just-
>> Go online, find a PDF.

83
00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.230
>> Yeah, learning at a distance.

84
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:36.380
I know that some of
the universities I attended,

85
00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:42.200
they offer online classes, where you have
direct communication with your professor.

86
00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.143
They offer all sorts
of great resources for

87
00:04:45.143 --> 00:04:48.750
the professor to demonstrate
the materials to you.

88
00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.020
>> Yeah, or sometimes they have podcasts.

89
00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.580
>> Podcasts.

90
00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.210
>> Maybe you can't show up to class,
but at least you can watch the lecture.

91
00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:56.200
>> Absolutely, yeah.

92
00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.400
So, those are some great ideas
that someone came up with.

93
00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.760
Science and technology,
virtual environments,

94
00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.960
you can see up there,
that picture that you see up there,

95
00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.360
that is actually one of
the first virtual realities.

96
00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.080
Is that what you would call it?

97
00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.769
One of the first virtual reality headsets.

98
00:05:16.769 --> 00:05:18.980
[LAUGH] There you go.

99
00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:20.480
I think it was in the 80s.

100
00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.230
But, so even if you look at some
of the newer stuff that's out now,

101
00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:27.430
you have the Oculus and the Vive.

102
00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.400
Those things,
they haven't really changed much.

103
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:34.360
There's still semi-big, semi-bulky,
maybe a little lighter set of gloves.

104
00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:35.545
I think they use remotes now.

105
00:05:35.545 --> 00:05:37.000
They got away from the gloves.

106
00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.858
People sweat a lot.

107
00:05:38.858 --> 00:05:41.963
>> [LAUGH]
>> Anyways-

108
00:05:41.963 --> 00:05:43.920
>> And, I just want to mention that, for

109
00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:44.590
science and technology,

110
00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:46.710
you have to have what we mentioned before,
with computer vision,

111
00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:51.468
where we can take images, or videos,
or just whatever and analyze.

112
00:05:51.468 --> 00:05:57.410
And, say maybe you want to
detect where your baby is,

113
00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:00.880
if you have a baby, and
you want to have like a camera at home,

114
00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:04.220
making sure your baby is in the crib,
not outside of it.

115
00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:07.626
>> Yeah, but make sure you're at home,
also, just in another room.

116
00:06:07.626 --> 00:06:10.980
>> [LAUGH]
>> All right, cool.

117
00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:15.690
So, another little virtual
reality headset picture, there.

118
00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:16.970
This is the Google Cardboard.

119
00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:19.234
I don't know if you've ever had
a chance to play with one of these.

120
00:06:19.234 --> 00:06:21.767
They're really cool for what it is.

121
00:06:21.767 --> 00:06:23.782
You just hold it up,
put your phone in there.

122
00:06:23.782 --> 00:06:26.120
I think you have to use a Samsung.

123
00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.360
You put your phone in there,
and put it up to your face, and

124
00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.200
there's all sorts of cool,
interactive experiences.

125
00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:34.467
>> It makes it look more like you're
interacting your phone than doing

126
00:06:34.467 --> 00:06:35.738
a virtual reality thing.

127
00:06:35.738 --> 00:06:37.576
Well, there's a giant
screen in front of you.

128
00:06:37.576 --> 00:06:40.934
>> Yeah, so for entertainment,
there's always games.

129
00:06:40.934 --> 00:06:43.070
Games is a huge market.

130
00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:48.510
Interactive television,
post production of movie and music.

131
00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:51.848
So, a lot of that gets done here,
actually.

132
00:06:53.722 --> 00:07:00.310
>> We do a lot of recording, and
then there's a lot of editing.

133
00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:05.232
So, it's not so
easy as to just talk into the camera.

134
00:07:05.232 --> 00:07:07.300
>> Yeah, we don't just record it,
then upload it.

135
00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:08.610
>> Yeah, of course.

136
00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:11.260
So anyways, you got that.

137
00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.230
I guess one more thing,
medical applications.

138
00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:14.370
That's a huge market.

139
00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:16.820
That should, of course, be said as well.

140
00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:23.940
But, yeah, so hope you enjoyed this
list of little, simple examples.

141
00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:29.290
>> Remember to keep it the back of
your mind, so you have ideas or

142
00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:33.850
things you may want to create, or
apply to your own multimedia application.

143
00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:34.350
>> Absolutely.
