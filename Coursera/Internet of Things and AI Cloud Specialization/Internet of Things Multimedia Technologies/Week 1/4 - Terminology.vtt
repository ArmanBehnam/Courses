00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.390
Everyone, welcome back and here,
now, we're going to talk about

2
00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:07.520
the terminology that we may or
may not be covering in this course.

3
00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.180
Once again, there's a giant list.

4
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:14.540
So feel free to take your time, go to the
view, pause, read, look it up, whatever.

5
00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.640
>> No, absolutely, yeah, so
I guess first off, terminology,

6
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.180
we're probably going to be saying this
quite a few times, multimedia, right?

7
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.380
>> Yeah.

8
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.160
>> In general, I guess, for us multimedia
is going to be the audio/video

9
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.840
utilities or utilization of multimedia.

10
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:30.743
Is that the right way of saying it?

11
00:00:30.743 --> 00:00:35.041
>> [LAUGH]
>> And yeah, so, it's basically

12
00:00:35.041 --> 00:00:40.190
combining the different formats
that consist of multimedia.

13
00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.800
You have motion picture so
movies, motion video,

14
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.730
you have audio, you have still images,
you have animation, I believe graphics.

15
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:51.580
>> Yeah, graphics.

16
00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.290
>> Graphics, computer generated images.

17
00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.280
Yeah, so
there's all different kinds of multimedia.

18
00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.610
All different kids of
forms of multimedia and

19
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.820
hopefully we get a chance to bring in
as many of those forms as possible.

20
00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.400
I'm pretty sure we mostly
folks seen on video and audio.

21
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.770
So yeah, libraries.

22
00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.750
>> Library is something we're going to
talk about more in the supplemental

23
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:20.310
section, but in our case the library
is something you use in programming to

24
00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.890
add functionality to
a program you're writing.

25
00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.220
Says maybe you don't
want to reinvent the wheel.

26
00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.530
Someone already did created like
some kind of like, the camera,

27
00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:33.720
someone already made the camera.

28
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.213
You don't have to reinvent that to
create images so put it in my way

29
00:01:38.213 --> 00:01:40.580
>> Yeah, and so on and so forth.

30
00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.100
The rest of this list I would recommend
once again, pausing and taking some time

31
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.580
to read some of these scalability,
maintainability, sub-sampling.

32
00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:54.910
All of these play a role, one way or
another when working with multimedia.

33
00:01:54.910 --> 00:02:00.040
Here's some more terminology you that
might hear if you're an Apple user.

34
00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.420
QuickTime is a great multimedia resource
that already comes with your computer.

35
00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.810
You can use it to do all sort of tasks for
you.

36
00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.050
We will talk about one of
the flavors of multimedia,

37
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.640
you have motion video,
you could pause, check this out.

38
00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.780
Again, we'll provide you with the website,

39
00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.430
JavaScript, Netscape's
simple scripting language.

40
00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.940
It was used,
I feel like it's still used obviously but

41
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.115
Netscape was an old browser I remember.

42
00:02:30.115 --> 00:02:34.016
[LAUGH] A long time ago
not around anymore, is it?

43
00:02:34.016 --> 00:02:36.846
>> Not sure.
>> [CROSSTALK] [LAUGH] I haven't used it

44
00:02:36.846 --> 00:02:37.834
in forever.

45
00:02:37.834 --> 00:02:41.528
>> Anyways so there you go,
DirectX, Delta Frame.

46
00:02:41.528 --> 00:02:42.980
You might hear someone say like,

47
00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.170
hey let's make an app that
calculates the Delta Frames.

48
00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.110
Instead of sending a new image each time,

49
00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.785
you just calculate the difference in each
image and send that information instead.

50
00:02:52.785 --> 00:02:56.480
>> Right.
>> All these things can help you maximize

51
00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:02.820
your thought process when constructing
applications in the multimedia realm.

52
00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.040
I think we got one more here,
so yeah, codecs.

53
00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.220
In the next module, actually,
you're going to hear our Professor speak

54
00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.750
to you a lot more about
audio/video codecs.

55
00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.570
And I know he did this back
in the VOIP module, but

56
00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:22.800
he's going to do it again on a whole
other level dealing more with media.

57
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.100
So with video motion picture codecs.

58
00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.530
So, yeah, there you go.

59
00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.670
Feel free to skip through this,
use it however you like,

60
00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:40.380
put it on your cheat sheet, and
we'll see you in the next videos.
