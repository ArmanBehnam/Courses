00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:06.550
For the second lesson in this course,
we will be going over some concepts,

2
00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:11.290
I guess, or some general information
that we felt would be pertinent

3
00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:14.600
to this particular course as a whole.

4
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.610
Multimedia, right?

5
00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:16.780
>> Right.
>> So

6
00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.330
first we got Multimedia Computing and
Classification.

7
00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:24.330
So it's kind of like taking multimedia,
breaking it down to a few

8
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.260
of its components and trying to,
hopefully, explain a little.

9
00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.760
>> Yeah.
Things like file formats or how it's used.

10
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.950
>> Yeah.
Get a little deeper into it.

11
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.780
The importance of multimedia, all right?

12
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.800
So, I know you've all thought about
it at least once in your life.

13
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.500
How our world is just so

14
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.000
enveloped with what we have
around us especially multimedia.

15
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.630
Everything that we absorb from
the television, from the internet,

16
00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.780
from everything that's around us.

17
00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.450
Driving forces in multimedia, the things
that are kind of pushing it forward.

18
00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.670
Multimedia applications, going to talk
to you about maybe some examples.

19
00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.180
>> Yeah, giving you a little
introduction to multimedia applications,

20
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.180
because later on we're going to be
developing on tiny little multimedia

21
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.740
application for everyone.

22
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.442
>> Yeah, and then we'll kind of
talk about working with libraries,

23
00:01:10.442 --> 00:01:13.400
using among them on
the DragonBoard 410c here.

24
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:13.990
Randy?

25
00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.850
>> Yeah, as I mentioned before
in the previous lesson,

26
00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.570
we talked about how to use libraries so
you don't have to say,

27
00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.450
we implement something that's
aren't done by someone else.

28
00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.110
>> Yeah, that's actually really built
really cool application for you.

29
00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.020
So, Randy and the team built
something really nice for you and

30
00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.820
we'll be demonstrating and
then providing code to you for.

31
00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:32.740
So, stay tune.
