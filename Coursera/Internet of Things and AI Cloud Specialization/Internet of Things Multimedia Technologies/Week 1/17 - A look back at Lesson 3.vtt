00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:01.586
Hey, everyone.

2
00:00:01.586 --> 00:00:06.342
So now let's take a look back
at everything we've learned in

3
00:00:06.342 --> 00:00:08.587
this supplemental lesson.

4
00:00:08.587 --> 00:00:15.080
>> Yeah, so we kind of started off talking
to you about the Android multimedia.

5
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.330
And this was kind of just to
give you a brief look at what

6
00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.480
you've might start
looking at if you decided

7
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.380
not to make your multimedia application
on Linux like we are going to do.

8
00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.080
So kind of pointing you in the direction.

9
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.637
>> If you're really familiar with Android,
you really like it a lot, or maybe you

10
00:00:34.637 --> 00:00:38.194
just wanted to add some cool multimedia
functionality to the previous web app,

11
00:00:38.194 --> 00:00:39.754
the barebones web app we gave you.

12
00:00:39.754 --> 00:00:40.295
>> Yeah.

13
00:00:40.295 --> 00:00:46.171
>> So then after that, we talked about
three very important programming

14
00:00:46.171 --> 00:00:51.962
languages, C, C++, those are very
similar because they're both C.

15
00:00:51.962 --> 00:00:55.107
[LAUGH] And then,
we also talked about Python,

16
00:00:55.107 --> 00:00:58.989
where we'll be mainly using
Python in our application.

17
00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:05.308
>> Yeah, and if you got confused over any
of this stuff because we've kind of only

18
00:01:05.308 --> 00:01:10.948
briefly brushed on them, please go back to
our earlier courses and check that out,

19
00:01:10.948 --> 00:01:16.129
or you can search online and there's so
much resources on Python and C, so.

20
00:01:16.129 --> 00:01:18.108
>> It's a supplemental lessons, so

21
00:01:18.108 --> 00:01:22.340
hopefully you guys take the main topics
out of these, and do a little bit of

22
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.586
your own research till you can learn
more about every single one of these.

23
00:01:26.586 --> 00:01:27.421
>> Of course, thank you.

24
00:01:27.421 --> 00:01:31.255
And, yeah, so stay tuned, actually,
next course, I'm sorry, next module,

25
00:01:31.255 --> 00:01:34.036
you'll have our esteemed
Professor Harinath Garudadri,

26
00:01:34.036 --> 00:01:36.890
who will talk to you
about multimedia codecs.

27
00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.066
It'll be very exciting.

28
00:01:38.066 --> 00:01:40.674
And then right after that,
we have the last module,

29
00:01:40.674 --> 00:01:43.180
which will be us building
an application for you.

30
00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.420
So on the DragonBoard right here.

31
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.129
So yeah, we look forward to
seeing you then, and until then.

32
00:01:50.129 --> 00:01:50.837
>> Until then.

33
00:01:50.837 --> 00:01:51.474
>> Yeah [LAUGH].
