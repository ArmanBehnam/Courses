00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:01.250
Hey everyone, so

2
00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:06.070
now you've seen almost everything
that has to do about multimedia.

3
00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:08.915
So you know what's important about it.

4
00:00:08.915 --> 00:00:12.320
>> I guess so
yeah the importance of multimedia and

5
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.650
kind of our technology is advancing in

6
00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:23.200
every which way with speaking of
Internet of Things, there will be a lot

7
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:29.130
of advancements in the multimedia,
I guess, sector of Internet of Things.

8
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.280
So what's important about multimedia,
the importance of it?

9
00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:39.080
Well, with multimedia we
are seeing a digital,

10
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.150
read it there,
digital audio revolutionizing in music.

11
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.200
Right so I mean just in,
I would imagine in your generation, but

12
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.052
in my generation I'm relatively young,
late 20s, 30s.

13
00:00:54.052 --> 00:00:55.560
>> [LAUGH] Late 30s.

14
00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:56.380
>> Yeah, late 30s.

15
00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.750
No, but the iPod, this iPod MP3,

16
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:05.900
I guess you could say Flash
storage music players.

17
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.410
Now, let's just use the iPod for example.

18
00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:08.520
>> Yeah.
>> So the iPod,

19
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.600
I mean this came out in my generation.

20
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.660
It's amazing, I've seen-
>> I actually remember when I

21
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.760
had the little CD player,
you carry that around with the headphones.

22
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.280
>> And every step you take it's skipping.

23
00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.600
I remember before that
I had a tape player.

24
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.360
I had a Walkman with cassette tapes.

25
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.990
You know, I remember all of
our cars had cassette players.

26
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.450
I had a cassette player car.

27
00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.830
So I mean like,
in our lifetime we've seen so

28
00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:45.005
much advancement in audio multimedia or
the audio media.

29
00:01:45.005 --> 00:01:45.570
>> Mm-hm.

30
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.380
>> Yeah, so I mean, so important,
it's such an important field and

31
00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.640
it's advancing so
quickly you can even see it.

32
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.910
You can see it on a day to day basis,
right?

33
00:01:57.256 --> 00:02:02.160
It's also important, as we're going to
be focusing on the slide, but

34
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.420
the convergence of computer,
telecommunication radio, and TV.

35
00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.690
Right so, now you can make
phone calls over your computer.

36
00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.320
You can make phone calls from
your phone to a computer.

37
00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.920
From a computer to a phone,
from a computer to 20,000 computers.

38
00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.680
You can send news all around the world,

39
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.900
YouTube, the moment something
happens anywhere in the world,

40
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.060
someone records that and
puts it up on YouTube.

41
00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.680
So how important is multimedia?

42
00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:36.660
It's very important.

43
00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:37.370
Very important.

44
00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.770
>> Very important.
>> It's all around you.

45
00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.810
>> Yeah, and
the new application potential is huge.

46
00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.030
I mean, every day I feel like I hear some
new application that I wish I thought of.

47
00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.180
That someone puts up on the Apple Store
and makes millions of dollars because he

48
00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.410
just took something that might have
already existed or something that everyone

49
00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.180
already knew about or uses and
just thought of that new clever way.

50
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.770
>> To improve it or use it better.

51
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.100
>> To improve it, yeah, or
get it out to the public.

52
00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.610
>> Right?

53
00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:06.230
>> Right.

54
00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:12.020
So, yeah, so you know,
as with every good thing

55
00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.990
comes some downfalls and
as multi media advances and

56
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:22.620
as more people start to
interact on the web or

57
00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.830
through the networks, you're going to
see also some technical issues.

58
00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:31.170
There's going to be possibly
some security breaches.

59
00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.200
You have to be prepared for that as well.

60
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.910
So yeah,
the importance of multimedia is huge.

61
00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.770
Just the fact that you're taking this
course shows that you're interested in it.

62
00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:48.610
And we hope that later on when you
get to build the application with us,

63
00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.110
you'll at least have some fun.

64
00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.240
>> And remember, if you guys
are really interested in this stuff,

65
00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.070
don't forget to check
out the lecture slides,

66
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.380
we have a link right there on the side.

67
00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.010
>> Yeah.
>> You can check out those slides.

68
00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.140
Yeah I mean,
it's a lot of the same information.

69
00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.130
A little bit more of course.

70
00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.010
There's some diagrams on that
link right down there as well.

71
00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:09.430
I'll provide it at the end of the slide
show two so you can that out.

72
00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.260
And also stay tuned for the next module
where our professors going to speak to you

73
00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:15.690
a lot about codecs and multimedia.

74
00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.750
So that will be really interesting as
well but anyways, that's pretty much just

75
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.400
us talking to you about the importance
of what you're kind of diving into here.

76
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.370
So we look forward to seeing
you in the next videos.
