00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.480
Welcome back everyone.

2
00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:05.950
So it's time to demo
the application we made.

3
00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:09.860
First, of course, we're gonna deploy
it to the board or at least go

4
00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.110
over a slide that kind of outlines
what we did to deploy it to the board.

5
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.460
Randy put something good together for you.

6
00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.520
>> So just in case you need a reminder,

7
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.450
because remember we've done this before
multiple times in the previous courses,

8
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:23.470
previous lessons, previous modules,
etc., everything.

9
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.784
So, after you've pulled the code from
the repository, you wanna go ahead and

10
00:00:29.784 --> 00:00:31.408
load it up in Android Studio.

11
00:00:31.408 --> 00:00:35.531
And in Android Studio you have a run
button at the top or you can go straight,

12
00:00:35.531 --> 00:00:37.953
at the top there's a little play button,
or

13
00:00:37.953 --> 00:00:40.460
you can go to the drop down menu and
click Run.

14
00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.579
On most systems you can also do Ctrl+R,

15
00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:45.842
which is the default key
binding to run the app.

16
00:00:45.842 --> 00:00:49.211
And then you wanna make sure
your device is plugged in.

17
00:00:49.211 --> 00:00:51.916
So power it on,
make sure you're in developer mode.

18
00:00:51.916 --> 00:00:54.341
>> USB debugging has to be activated.

19
00:00:54.341 --> 00:00:56.620
>> Yeah, and then plug in your device.

20
00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.150
Your device should appear on
the window and go ahead and deploy it.

21
00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.480
>> Yeah, so if you need a refresher on
this, go back to course two where we set

22
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.640
up the whole development environment
>> And

23
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.050
maybe check out some of the videos again,
get familiar with ADB again.

24
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.330
You'll be fine,
we've done it plenty of times, so

25
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.610
you should be familiar with it by now.

26
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.180
So that being said,

27
00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.610
we already actually pushed our
application onto our DragonBoard.

28
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.300
So we are sitting pretty right now.

29
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.407
All right,
now we wanna show you a demo, right?

30
00:01:24.407 --> 00:01:25.860
>> Yeah, we're gonna go ahead and-
>> Yeah,

31
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.725
we talked about Linphone
earlier in this course.

32
00:01:28.725 --> 00:01:33.175
We wanted to show you how our application
can actually communicate with other SIP

33
00:01:33.175 --> 00:01:34.622
based VoIP application.

34
00:01:34.622 --> 00:01:36.713
So Linphone being a SIP based application.

35
00:01:36.713 --> 00:01:42.350
We're going to pull up a Linphone
app on an iPhone, actually.

36
00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.480
And then we are going to communicate
with the application that we made

37
00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:47.610
on the DragonBoard.

38
00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.890
So let's take a look at
the DragonBoard screen here, and

39
00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.200
then we're gonna actually kind of
show you both of these screens so

40
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.730
you'll get a chance to see
everything that's happening here.

41
00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:59.750
So we have the DragonBoard screen.

42
00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:05.180
Should have the other phone screen right
here, and we're gonna make this call.

43
00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.400
So I'm gonna open up the application
that we made as a VoIP demo.

44
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.550
Now what do we have to put up here?

45
00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.739
>> So, If I remember in the previous
lesson, I mentioned for

46
00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:16.055
one level security we have
the authorization code.

47
00:02:16.055 --> 00:02:17.165
So you need to enter that in.

48
00:02:17.165 --> 00:02:18.085
>> That's password, right?

49
00:02:18.085 --> 00:02:19.985
>> Yeah, don't tell anyone.

50
00:02:19.985 --> 00:02:20.894
So password.

51
00:02:20.894 --> 00:02:24.714
It'll unlock the app, and you can use it,
make the calls and what not.

52
00:02:24.714 --> 00:02:25.968
>> And then I'm gonna call you, right?

53
00:02:25.968 --> 00:02:27.953
So yours is calit?

54
00:02:27.953 --> 00:02:30.058
>> Yeah, it's calit2tester-
>> 2?

55
00:02:30.058 --> 00:02:31.231
tester 2?

56
00:02:31.231 --> 00:02:34.200
And so it already has all of the suffixes.

57
00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.664
>> Yeah, it automatically appends and

58
00:02:37.664 --> 00:02:41.758
puts things like the at siv-
>> At siv.linphone and

59
00:02:41.758 --> 00:02:42.560
everything in there.

60
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.430
So, all right, so
now I'm gonna make the call.

61
00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:47.730
And we're not gonna answer this call,

62
00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.140
we're just gonna show you
that it's connecting.

63
00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.542
So real time right here, make call, boom.

64
00:02:52.542 --> 00:02:53.054
>> Here we go.

65
00:02:53.054 --> 00:02:54.238
>> So he could answer that.

66
00:02:54.238 --> 00:02:56.351
You know I have this nifty headset on.

67
00:02:56.351 --> 00:02:58.080
He's not gonna answer it,
just gonna hit end.

68
00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.670
But I could talk here or

69
00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.629
go into the DragonBoard through
the Internet all the way to his phone.

70
00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:07.791
>> Yeah, so that means you also,
communicate with other computers because

71
00:03:07.791 --> 00:03:09.990
there's a desktop
Linphone version as well.

72
00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.874
It's pretty neat.
>> Yeah, so

73
00:03:10.874 --> 00:03:15.436
now what we wanna do is we wanna show
you something that's even cooler.

74
00:03:15.436 --> 00:03:17.600
We wanna take our application.

75
00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.040
We put our application
on his Android phone.

76
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.970
And then we have the exact same
application on the DragonBoard.

77
00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.249
So we're gonna kinda pull
up the same thing again.

78
00:03:26.249 --> 00:03:30.010
We're gonna take a look at
the DragonBoard screen here.

79
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.780
>> Okay, so now we're gonna go ahead and
demo it on an Android device, so

80
00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.664
you guys can just pretend
it's a DragonBoard, right?

81
00:03:35.664 --> 00:03:39.790
>> Yeah, so essentially, this is Android,
we're running Android on the DragonBoard.

82
00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.120
If you had two DragonBoards, you could put
this application on both DragonBoards and

83
00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.820
talk to each other.

84
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.995
So what, you already got
the authorization set up in there?

85
00:03:48.995 --> 00:03:51.922
>> I got the authorization set up and
I have the account I'm gonna call,

86
00:03:51.922 --> 00:03:53.651
which is on there, so that's MOOC SIP.

87
00:03:53.651 --> 00:03:58.123
And you've ended the call that
we previously did before, and

88
00:03:58.123 --> 00:04:00.667
go ahead and make call and bam.

89
00:04:00.667 --> 00:04:05.280
>> All right, so yeah, as you can see,
I have the the phone is picking up.

90
00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.660
That's his calit2_buddy,
I can accept this.

91
00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.030
You're not gonna really hear anything.

92
00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.105
We're not hooked up that way.

93
00:04:11.105 --> 00:04:17.220
But if you did this at home you
would be talking to your friend.

94
00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.705
Or maybe a partner that you're
developing DragonBoard 410c stuff with.

95
00:04:21.705 --> 00:04:22.564
>> Yeah, sweet.

96
00:04:22.564 --> 00:04:23.249
>> Yeah, awesome.

97
00:04:23.249 --> 00:04:25.501
Yeah, we're all set.

98
00:04:25.501 --> 00:04:28.700
So what we do wanna go over with,
we wanna go back to the slide show.

99
00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.630
We wanna talk to you about some stuff that

100
00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.256
you could add into this
application that we gave.

101
00:04:35.256 --> 00:04:38.843
>> Yeah, remember I mentioned multiple
times, this app's pretty bare bones.

102
00:04:38.843 --> 00:04:43.470
You can just call somebody or
receive calls from someone else.

103
00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:47.873
The security level is pretty weak, because
a lot of things are hard-coded in and

104
00:04:47.873 --> 00:04:50.282
you just have one simple password request.

105
00:04:50.282 --> 00:04:54.500
So here on the slides, you guys can
just check it out, pause video, or

106
00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.950
load up the slides yourselves.

107
00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:02.310
And maybe there's some suggestions for
ways to improve the app.

108
00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.659
Make it better, make more of a buzz,
make it cooler,

109
00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:07.692
make it more like Linphone maybe or
like improved version Linphone,

110
00:05:07.692 --> 00:05:10.475
improved version-
>> Yeah, we went over this in a previous

111
00:05:10.475 --> 00:05:14.475
lesson, in this particular module in fact,
where we talked about Linphone.

112
00:05:14.475 --> 00:05:15.659
All the cool features they have in there,
it's open source.

113
00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:18.960
They have open source Android.

114
00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.245
So, you can go in there,
take out a bunch of features,

115
00:05:21.245 --> 00:05:24.709
throw them in this application, create
new classes, do all sorts of cool stuff.

116
00:05:24.709 --> 00:05:28.319
Make your version of this
application more robust.

117
00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:30.210
We'd love to see it on
the discussions as well too, so

118
00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:31.734
if you have any cool
stuff to share with us.

119
00:05:31.734 --> 00:05:35.124
>> Yeah, share it around, maybe everyone
can just contribute a little bit.

120
00:05:35.124 --> 00:05:38.294
You have your own developing pool for
an awesome VoIP application.

121
00:05:38.294 --> 00:05:42.078
>> Yeah, great, so we will see
you in the next videos coming up.

122
00:05:42.078 --> 00:05:44.981
I think we have one more
lesson in this module.

123
00:05:44.981 --> 00:05:50.843
So, I hope you enjoyed seeing
the VoIP application, and stay tuned.
