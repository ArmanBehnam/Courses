00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:07.460
Now, in the last video we talked to you
about making your home smarter, right?

2
00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.180
Well, there's also making
your office smarter.

3
00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:15.640
Now obviously, there are gonna be
a lot of things that are the same,

4
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.750
when you're making your office smarter,
making your home smarter.

5
00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.040
But there are certain things
that might differ because

6
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.400
picture yourself sitting at your desk,
and you look around.

7
00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:31.450
There's gonna be certain things on your
desk that you use all the time that

8
00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:39.480
you might want to integrate some
sensors into, make simpler.

9
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.370
But I also wanted to talk to you

10
00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.290
a little bit about the whole VoIP aspect
of making your office smarter, right?

11
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.960
So we know that you have these
huge companies out there

12
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.220
that take calls all the time,
make calls all the time.

13
00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.714
International needs where they
need to communicate from one

14
00:01:00.714 --> 00:01:03.807
country to another country all the time.

15
00:01:03.807 --> 00:01:07.568
Right, well the old way of doing things
cost these companies a lot of money.

16
00:01:07.568 --> 00:01:08.301
>> Right.

17
00:01:08.301 --> 00:01:12.217
>> Now we kind of talked about this
already in a previous lesson or module,

18
00:01:12.217 --> 00:01:15.300
but I want to kind of just
dive a little deeper, I guess.

19
00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.300
VoIP's out now and

20
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.390
you have these companies that all they
do is they just pay an Internet bill.

21
00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.760
A nice, yeah, nice wide band.

22
00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.310
>> Basically, free calling, right?

23
00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.934
>> Yeah, basically free calling, right?

24
00:01:27.934 --> 00:01:32.433
So, now, not only can these companies call
all these other places that they need

25
00:01:32.433 --> 00:01:33.358
to get a hold of,

26
00:01:33.358 --> 00:01:37.279
but they can also, for instance,
I think we talked about this, too.

27
00:01:37.279 --> 00:01:41.342
You want a 24 hour customer
service hotline, right?

28
00:01:41.342 --> 00:01:46.333
Well, in the United States,
the work days from 9 to 5.

29
00:01:46.333 --> 00:01:47.577
>> Yeah, normally.

30
00:01:47.577 --> 00:01:51.290
>> A normally 8 to 4, 10 to 6,
whatever you wanna say.

31
00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:52.730
So 8 hours, whatever.

32
00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.120
But then people go home and
they go to sleep.

33
00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.980
Well, what happens if someone
wants to call you at 7 o'clock?

34
00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.460
Well, it's the morning
time in another country.

35
00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.900
So now they could take the calls
in another country while

36
00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.570
one call center is sleeping,
cuz it's night time.

37
00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:12.460
You have to sleep.

38
00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.640
Another call center, they're just waking
up and starting their job, right?

39
00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.920
So this is all done over VoIP.

40
00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.590
And you can basically establish
connections with your customers 24

41
00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.050
hours a day without skipping a beat.

42
00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.620
>> RIght.

43
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.021
>> Right, so it's great for
international business, but again,

44
00:02:30.021 --> 00:02:34.821
I want to go back to looking around
your office and looking around things

45
00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:39.800
that don't exist yet and how you could
apply ideas to what's around you.

46
00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.764
Now, just talked about
a couple things there.

47
00:02:41.764 --> 00:02:48.287
But think about it and apply it.

48
00:02:48.287 --> 00:02:51.306
>> Maybe you can improve.

49
00:02:51.306 --> 00:02:53.780
You have more people in
an office than your own house.

50
00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.480
So kind of improve interactions
amongst the employees.

51
00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.480
>> I can just think of one thing.

52
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.980
I know electric bills are really high.

53
00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.380
Like even the building we're in, it's
outrageous, the electric bills, right?

54
00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.130
Well, what if your employees, or

55
00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.780
what if you just didn't want
to pay that much electricity?

56
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.730
And your employees were
overabusing the heater.

57
00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:15.740
>> Yeah.

58
00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.090
>> Or abusing the thermostat in general.

59
00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.874
Right, well you could control
the thermostat from your phone, right?

60
00:03:21.874 --> 00:03:26.157
Or you could monitor the temperature
of you building from your phone or

61
00:03:26.157 --> 00:03:27.179
from your home.

62
00:03:27.179 --> 00:03:30.067
>> Or maybe if someone tinkers with the
thermostat, you'll get a phone call and

63
00:03:30.067 --> 00:03:31.718
you can yell at whoever's
touching it [LAUGH]

64
00:03:31.718 --> 00:03:32.356
>> There you go.

65
00:03:32.356 --> 00:03:36.520
Stop touching the thermostat.

66
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.330
That popped into my head right now.

67
00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.580
There's a lot of things that you can do.

68
00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:46.976
And think about sitting at your
desk right now, at your office, and

69
00:03:46.976 --> 00:03:52.000
what you could apply to make it more
interactive and a smart office.

70
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.280
Stay tuned.
See you in the next video.
