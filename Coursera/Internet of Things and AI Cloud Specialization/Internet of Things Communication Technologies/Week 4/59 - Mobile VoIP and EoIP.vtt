1
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.020
So devices are getting smaller,
more portable.

2
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:10.560
Devices are getting smarter in general and
stronger, more powerful.

3
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.860
So we're gonna wanna talk
about mobile VoIP and

4
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.780
how the game has kinda
changed because of this.

5
00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:20.159
And then I wanna go into a thing
called EoIP, which is taking VoIP and

6
00:00:20.159 --> 00:00:23.340
just blowing it up and
saying, hey, you know what.

7
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.140
Why just VoIP?

8
00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.050
>> Right, why just voice?

9
00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:27.282
Everything over IP.

10
00:00:27.282 --> 00:00:30.620
The whole world is gonna be on
the internet one day, right?

11
00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:34.140
We're just gonna be using networks
to transfer every bit of data.

12
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.280
So everything over IP.

13
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.870
Now, just gonna jog your mind
a little bit more again, but

14
00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.260
think about everything mobile.

15
00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:43.990
What do you have that you
take with you everyday?

16
00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:49.220
Your phone, your keys, your wallet,
your purse, I don't know.

17
00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.750
Hair ties, necklaces,
jewelry, everything, right?

18
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.236
Now, [COUGH] they're already starting to
turn this stuff into ways to communicate

19
00:00:58.236 --> 00:01:00.585
with each other, the Internet of things.

20
00:01:00.585 --> 00:01:04.774
Applying it to your everyday
mobile devices, wearables,

21
00:01:04.774 --> 00:01:10.005
your Google Glass, your Apple Watch,
smart watches in general, yeah.

22
00:01:10.005 --> 00:01:18.028
[COUGH] Fitbit ways to
monitor your health, right?

23
00:01:18.028 --> 00:01:21.399
[COUGH] I remember when I was
a kid watching Inspector Gadget,

24
00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:23.589
maybe you've seen Inspector Gadget?

25
00:01:23.589 --> 00:01:24.089
>> Of course.

26
00:01:24.089 --> 00:01:24.947
He's great.

27
00:01:24.947 --> 00:01:29.846
>> To call Penny on your watch,
that exists now, crazily enough.

28
00:01:29.846 --> 00:01:36.098
So, someone had to think of that and
someone had to apply to get it done,

29
00:01:36.098 --> 00:01:40.920
but also mobile VoIP can
be applied to business.

30
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.090
So you're a traveling business man and
you have customers.

31
00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.200
You have people you need
to get in touch with.

32
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.690
And you're not at your office right now.

33
00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:51.780
You're on the go.

34
00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.940
So you can actually carry your VoIP
accounts with you everywhere you go,

35
00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.540
so you are essentially a walking office.

36
00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:07.370
Wherever you go, you can root down and
set up and it's like you're anywhere.

37
00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:12.540
In a hotel, maybe you're overseas doing
some work, whatever you wanna do.

38
00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.412
So yeah, that being said all this stuff
can be done over many of the Internet

39
00:02:16.412 --> 00:02:17.214
connections.

40
00:02:17.214 --> 00:02:19.146
You have Wi-Fi you have 3G,

41
00:02:19.146 --> 00:02:24.017
your phone you take it out you're calling
in a lot of cases over Wi-Fi using

42
00:02:24.017 --> 00:02:28.532
VoIP broadband clear signal as
long as your Internet's good.

43
00:02:28.532 --> 00:02:33.590
But anyways, so
think of ways that you can apply VoIP or

44
00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:39.030
just in general things to your
everyday life, mobile life, right?

45
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.580
Everything over internet protocol.

46
00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.010
We went over that.

47
00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.530
We're going to go from not
only machine to machine, or

48
00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.961
thing to thing, but we're going
fro human to thing to computer to.

49
00:02:51.961 --> 00:02:53.498
>> To whatever.

50
00:02:53.498 --> 00:02:54.810
>> To whatever, yeah.

51
00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.208
It's everything.

52
00:02:57.208 --> 00:02:58.352
Yeah.

53
00:02:58.352 --> 00:03:01.695
Anyways, i hope you enjoyed that.

54
00:03:01.695 --> 00:03:04.170
[LAUGH] Kind of ranted a little bit.

55
00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.690
>> It's fine.
>> Yeah.

56
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:05.620
>> Very informative.

57
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.330
>> Yeah, so just having fun.

58
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.131
That's the whole idea,
having fun with what you're doing.

59
00:03:11.131 --> 00:03:16.020
So, I hope you take these ideas,
and make something amazing.

60
00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:20.050
I look forward to hearing from
all of you on the discussions.

61
00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.430
We look forward to helping you if you
need help or just having a quick chat.

62
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.610
So yeah,

63
00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.600
we'll see you in the next course where
we're gonna go over multimedia, right?

64
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:32.240
>> Yep.

65
00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.330
>> Kinda something similar to the void but
with.

66
00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:36.430
With-
>> Video

67
00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.390
>> Multimedia video aspects.

68
00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.400
So stay tuned, and
I hope you had a good time.
