00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:02.470
Everyone, welcome to module four.

2
00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:07.080
So in this module we're going to be going
over the VOIP app that we created so

3
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.720
you can have your own VOIP
app to work with but first,

4
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.370
we're gonna go over Android and
how it works with SIP.

5
00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:20.040
So we'll be talking about
the Android SIP classes.

6
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:25.650
So just sit tight, check out the video,
learn about all the classes that

7
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.470
had to deal with the VOIP app, cuz this
will help you understand what's happening

8
00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.540
later on in the next lesson where we
will actually go over the app itself.

9
00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.070
So as I mentioned, the two main topics
we'll be covering in this lesson will be

10
00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.980
the SipProfile and the SipManager classes.

11
00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.980
These will allow you to create
your Sip accounts and also manage

12
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.980
the phone calls between one account and
a differing account.
