1
00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.890
So VoIP and the smart home, right.

2
00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:06.450
I would imagine that, at least most,

3
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.620
most people's homes have
some smart aspect to it.

4
00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:13.630
>> Right.
>> Right.

5
00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:18.740
So the idea of this video
is to kind of jog your,

6
00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.950
jog your mind, jog your imagination
to think about things that

7
00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.530
don't exist yet or things that already
exist that you can apply the knowledge you

8
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.580
have acquired about throughout these
last courses in specialization and

9
00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.360
possibly expand on everything
that you know right now.

10
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.540
Right.
So I wanna talk to you about, or

11
00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.968
ask some questions to you make you
think a little bit about your home.

12
00:00:43.968 --> 00:00:47.910
You know, like what VoIP applications or

13
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.460
internet of things applications do
you have in your house right now?

14
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.760
So I know that, I mean, if I think
about my house, I have the Amazon TV.

15
00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.790
And they have a little remote control that
you can talk to, tell it to do stuff.

16
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.785
So it's taking my voice,
it's analyzing the data.

17
00:01:06.785 --> 00:01:09.060
>> Mm-hm.
>> And it's performing tasks, right?

18
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.090
Perfect example of VoIP.

19
00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.120
Now, what could you add to that?

20
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.100
What could you add to your house?

21
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.280
What could you add to an average object
in your house that's not connected?

22
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.890
>> Yeah.

23
00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.140
You might think it's sort of hard
to figure out what it is, but

24
00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.020
there's there's a billion.

25
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.510
There's probably like, you can make
everything in your house smart, right?

26
00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:27.600
It's your home.

27
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.679
>> Yeah, and I mean,
there are certain limitations, but

28
00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:32.960
I mean as technology advances,
there are so many things that you

29
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.758
can start adding technology to,
to have it connect to everything else.

30
00:01:37.758 --> 00:01:42.210
Now, see that little doorbell up
on the slide, it's just a basic

31
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.730
old school doorbell, hit the button and
it rings in your house, right?

32
00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:52.020
Well there's a company out there,
right over here called Ring.

33
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.110
You can kinda see this new-age doorbell,
it has a little camera on there.

34
00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.740
But even the most basic,
mundane object of your house,

35
00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:09.300
like the doorbell, can be made to
create a more safe environment,

36
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.650
a more interactive environment, and an
overall more efficient environment for you

37
00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.040
living there and for the people who are
trying to get in touch with you, right?

38
00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.970
S.

39
00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.690
Now, you're not home.

40
00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.350
And someone comes to your house.

41
00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.880
Just think it, like let's think
a good person comes to your house.

42
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.380
Rings the bell, looking for
you, it's a friend.

43
00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.495
Well, this doorbell pings your cell phone,

44
00:02:32.495 --> 00:02:37.295
the camera activates, the microphone
activates, and all of a sudden you have

45
00:02:37.295 --> 00:02:41.255
an open video VoIP call with the person
that´s standing at your door.

46
00:02:41.255 --> 00:02:41.910
>> It´s pretty sweet.

47
00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.925
>> From your cell phone,
you´re somewhere else in the world,

48
00:02:44.925 --> 00:02:46.015
who knows where you are.

49
00:02:46.015 --> 00:02:48.365
But, you're talking to
someone at your front door.

50
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.250
Sorry, you know I'm in
Australia right now.

51
00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:53.270
>> Or I'm shopping.

52
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.410
You gotta-
>> [LAUGH] I'm shopping, yeah.

53
00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.240
>> You gotta wait for a little bit.

54
00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:58.740
>> That being said, that's a good person.

55
00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.170
What if a bad person comes to your house
and they're just scoping your house

56
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.150
seeing if anyone's home because they wanna
steal your Christmas presents, but no.

57
00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.390
Because they ring your doorbell to see if
someone's home, and you answer it, and

58
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.080
they're like oh shoot, okay,
well I don't know you at the door.

59
00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.430
But, you don't know me either, so
it's kind of an awkward confrontation,

60
00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.400
you've saved your Christmas,
Christmas presents.

61
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.900
>> Yep, right.

62
00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:22.430
>> All right.

63
00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:28.650
So that's just a simple example of how you
can turn a basic object in your house,

64
00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.700
or even right outside your
house into something.

65
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.550
>> We have more examples, don't we?

66
00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.210
>> Very connected, yes.

67
00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:38.110
I don't know if any of you have any pets,
but I have two cats.

68
00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.520
So I thought this was
really interesting and

69
00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:41.870
I'm actually trying to build one myself.

70
00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.500
I've seen a friend of mine do
something similar, very interactive.

71
00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:51.570
But what if you could talk to your dog or
cat from work?

72
00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:57.020
Right, so, using the DragonBoard 410c, you
could create something similar to this.

73
00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:02.820
This is obviously a device
that you can buy somewhere.

74
00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.680
You can see the pictures up there.

75
00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.970
That already comes already pre-programmed,
but, where's the fun in that?

76
00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.320
You wanna build your
own internet of things.

77
00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.600
>> Like why do we have this,
do it yourself?

78
00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:12.100
Kind of thing.

79
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.150
>> Do it yourself.

80
00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:18.140
So you get a camera,
you get your VoIP applications set up,

81
00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:20.500
and you set it up in your house.

82
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.510
And look at that, you can have your
very own application from your work.

83
00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.200
Call in from your phone to
your Dragonboard at home.

84
00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.270
And talk to your dog, you know?

85
00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.170
>> [LAUGH]
>> Put a little monitor there.

86
00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:32.360
>> Or maybe not just your dog.

87
00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.350
Maybe you have a baby at home.

88
00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.230
You can check up on him just in case.

89
00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.365
>> You leave the baby at home?

90
00:04:37.365 --> 00:04:39.280
[LAUGH]
>> I'm not a parent, so [LAUGH]

91
00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.490
>> Yeah, or a baby, I guess.

92
00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:41.014
>> Or maybe
>> [LAUGH]

93
00:04:41.014 --> 00:04:42.422
>> Maybe the babysitter at home and

94
00:04:42.422 --> 00:04:44.012
you wanna check up on the babysitter.
>> There you go.

95
00:04:44.012 --> 00:04:44.852
That sounds better.

96
00:04:44.852 --> 00:04:46.217
So you're checking up on the babysitter.

97
00:04:46.217 --> 00:04:47.622
>> [LAUGH]

98
00:04:47.622 --> 00:04:50.080
>> There's, again, lots of applications.

99
00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.460
I thought that this particular one
was really cool so a little story.

100
00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.190
During a Machine Intelligence Class
that I took here,

101
00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:00.330
in short of machine intelligence, someone
in the class actually developed a really

102
00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:05.870
cool application using a microcontroller,
a system on chip similar to this.

103
00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:08.560
Not as powerful even.

104
00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.490
But what he could do is he could use
his computer, establish a connection,

105
00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:16.820
a VoIP connection or, just a,
I wanna call it EoIP,

106
00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:18.907
everything over internet
protocol connection.

107
00:05:18.907 --> 00:05:23.460
And what would happen,

108
00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.100
is he was able to control a laser pointer,
okay.

109
00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.470
So he would have a video
camera that would pop up.

110
00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.590
All of a sudden, his dog would run
into the room, because he would know

111
00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:35.300
that the camera started moving
on these stepper motors, right.

112
00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:36.430
You've learned how to program.

113
00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:38.910
He could move the camera around,

114
00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:42.910
he could control a laser pointer,
he could even release dog treats.

115
00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:45.850
He had a button that he could push
that would drop a dog treat and

116
00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:46.550
he could watch his dog.

117
00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:47.720
He could talk to his dog.

118
00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:52.610
He could push a button and then project
sound out through a speaker using

119
00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:56.350
one of the headers on the board or
even the USB.

120
00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:59.820
So, the-
>> Pretty sweet.

121
00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.850
>> Options are endless.

122
00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:02.600
>> Pretty awesome.

123
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:03.570
>> Yeah.

124
00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:08.800
Anyways, that's pretty much ways
to make your home smarter, right.

125
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:11.860
These are just things that exist now.

126
00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.300
You can expand on these ideas,
make them your own.

127
00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.460
You could create them yourself, or you
could think of something that's not out

128
00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:22.190
there yet, and make millions of dollars.

129
00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:25.760
>> And remember that everything
could become smarter.

130
00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:31.620
You'd think, remember the doorbell,
or the, yeah the door.

131
00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:32.130
>> The doorbell.

132
00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:32.830
>> Doorbell?

133
00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:33.390
>> Yeah, ring.

134
00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:34.453
>> I said it later.

135
00:06:34.453 --> 00:06:35.270
[LAUGH]
>> [LAUGH]

136
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:36.820
>> The ring, yeah the ring.

137
00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:39.890
Maybe you wouldn't have thought of that,
but these guys did.

138
00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:41.470
They're making money off of it.

139
00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:42.320
It's pretty sweet.

140
00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:46.230
>> Yeah, so
we look forward to hearing your ideas.

141
00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:49.770
Get thinking, walk around your house and
find something that's not smart yet, and

142
00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:51.210
see if you can make it smart.

143
00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:54.430
Use some sensors, or some motors,
and do something fun.

144
00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:56.350
But yeah, anyways,
we'll see you in the next video.
