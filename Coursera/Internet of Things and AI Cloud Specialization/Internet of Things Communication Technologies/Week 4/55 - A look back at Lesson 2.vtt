Hey everyone, so

2
00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:05.188
I hope you had an awesome time checking
out the app, seeing the app in action.

3
00:00:05.188 --> 00:00:08.800
Maybe to play it yourself, testing it
with your device, your DragonBoard and

4
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.960
your phones, something like that, right?

5
00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.795
>> Yeah, I mean as simple as it was,
it was actually very interesting and

6
00:00:14.795 --> 00:00:19.603
allows you to kind of just use it
as a template, build up from there.

7
00:00:19.603 --> 00:00:24.295
>> So, as a little summary of what we did,
remember we first went through the code.

8
00:00:24.295 --> 00:00:28.655
So, you guys see how the SIP profile and
the SIP manager,

9
00:00:28.655 --> 00:00:31.975
and maybe the SIP session, SIP auto call,
all those things interact with each other.

10
00:00:31.975 --> 00:00:36.260
How incoming and outgoing calls work.

11
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:42.040
So, the simple things that
are required for a barebones VoIP app.

12
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.770
>> And then we went over
deploying it to the board.

13
00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.300
So, we deployed it to the DragonBoard.

14
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.305
We didn't need to
actually do it ourselves.

15
00:00:47.305 --> 00:00:50.595
We had a deployed version on the
DragonBoard, we had a deployed version on

16
00:00:50.595 --> 00:00:53.725
our Android phone,
we had a Linphone app on our iPhone.

17
00:00:53.725 --> 00:00:56.825
We just showed how we were able to
use all these different SIP VoIP

18
00:00:56.825 --> 00:00:58.955
softwares to communicate with each other.

19
00:00:58.955 --> 00:01:03.100
So, that was pretty cool and I hope
you've had a chance to do it at home.

20
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:09.080
Maybe give us a call, you actually have
our VolP handles now, our SIP handles.

21
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.730
So, yeah, we look forward to
seeing you in the next lesson,

22
00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:16.964
the last lesson of this module, and
hope you had fun, so see you then.

23
00:01:16.964 --> 00:01:17.464
>> Yeah.
