00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:05.760
Welcome back, now I know you're
probably all very excited coming out of

2
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.950
the last lesson where you got to
try your very own VoIP application,

3
00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:16.850
now it's time to kind of I guess spread
your wings a little bit mentally and

4
00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.290
kinda brainstorm the things that you
should be capable of or at least,

5
00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.880
you know,
resourceful enough to get involved with.

6
00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.590
So, in this lesson we're gonna talk
to you about how you can expand

7
00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:36.300
the idea of VoIP to various
aspects of your life.

8
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.580
>> So, things like,
say your own home, making it cooler,

9
00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.790
smarter, VoIP in the smart home.

10
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.560
As well as your own, your workplace,
the office, things like that.

11
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.940
>> Yeah and then we're gonna also,
kind of, I mean, extend VoIP.

12
00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.810
And you see that little new acronym,

13
00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.840
I don't think we even went over that
in the cheat sheet area terminology,

14
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.390
but basically you're taking VoIP and
you're applying it to everything.

15
00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.000
So, it's the everything over
Internet protocol, beyond VOIP.

16
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.220
So, we're gonna just kind of talk
about expanding on these core concepts

17
00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.840
of transmitting information through
packets over the Internet, over a network.

18
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.910
And just how you can apply it
to everything in the world.

19
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.540
So, we look forward to
talking to you about this.

20
00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.480
It's gonna be just a fun,
relaxing discussion.

21
00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:24.560
>> Yeah, discussion lesson.

22
00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.430
So, we'll see you in the next videos.
