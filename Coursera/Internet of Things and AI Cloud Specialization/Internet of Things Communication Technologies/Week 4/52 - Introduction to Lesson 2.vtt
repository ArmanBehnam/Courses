00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:01.110
Hey, everyone.

2
00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:03.220
So, the moment you've been waiting for.

3
00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:04.180
Can I have a drumroll, please?

4
00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:07.222
[MUSIC]

5
00:00:07.222 --> 00:00:09.120
All right, so what are we doing here?

6
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.190
We're gonna be making the VoIP app.

7
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.550
Finally, right?

8
00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:14.340
After all these three modules and

9
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.270
a whole extra lesson of just talking
about what we're gonna be doing.

10
00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.570
So, first we're gonna have a little
code walk-through of what we did.

11
00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.000
You'll see how the, what we talked
about in the previous lesson,

12
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.230
the SIP manager and the SIP profiler and
all those things interact with each other.

13
00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.770
And then do note that
the app is pretty bare-bones.

14
00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.600
It'll have functions like just
outgoing and incoming calls, so

15
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.510
it'd be able to send calls and receive
calls and we hope we'll challenge you.

16
00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.210
And we'll mention this again to make
the app more robust, improve it,

17
00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.510
make it better,
do cooler things and what not.

18
00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.370
And then following the code walkthrough
we'll be deploying it to the board.

19
00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.810
And we'll have a little reminder
video of maybe you forgot how to

20
00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.310
push the code onto your board.

21
00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:05.520
We'll do that for you and we'll demo it.

22
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.210
We'll have little, some phone calls to
see, to prove that app actually works.

23
00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.530
So, with that, stick around and
we'll see you next section.

24
00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:15.030
