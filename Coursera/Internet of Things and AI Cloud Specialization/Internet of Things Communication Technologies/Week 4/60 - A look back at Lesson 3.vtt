00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.275
So, once again, I kinda jumped the gun.

2
00:00:02.275 --> 00:00:02.860
>> [LAUGH]
>> Say goodbye to [LAUGH]

3
00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:03.620
>> This is a little bit-

4
00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:04.490
>> Goodbye to everyone too

5
00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:05.210
quickly, right-
>> Yup.

6
00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.800
>> In the last video.

7
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.820
But, you know, as always,
we're gonna summarize the course here.

8
00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:11.470
Or, not the course, but
>> Course here.

9
00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:13.200
>> I think the lesson here and
the course might be a little bit-

10
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.060
>> Talk about it,

11
00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:17.765
this is the last video of this
whole entire course, right?

12
00:00:17.765 --> 00:00:20.805
>> Yeah, so
what did we go over in this lesson?

13
00:00:20.805 --> 00:00:22.325
I know it was just kind of

14
00:00:22.325 --> 00:00:23.975
a lot of us talking
>> Mm-hm.

15
00:00:23.975 --> 00:00:27.185
>> about just fun stuff, and
trying to motivate you guys.

16
00:00:27.185 --> 00:00:29.525
>> Right.
>> But, what's the takeaway?

17
00:00:29.525 --> 00:00:36.480
The takeaway is that Internet of things
VOIP data transfer over, through

18
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.840
packets over the Internet networks,
it's an ever-growing market right now.

19
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.930
And it's just so there's so
much products to be made and there's so

20
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.330
much advancements to be had.

21
00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.850
>> Yeah.

22
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.650
You remember it's like all do it yourself,

23
00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.780
so you just you know have a crazy idea,
awesome idea, work on it.

24
00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.030
Try to make it work.

25
00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.060
And then bring it to someone.

26
00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.150
Try to get some sponsorships or
something, it will be really cool.

27
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.700
>> Yeah, so there's plenty of resources
out there and we talked about

28
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.690
the smart home, the smart office,
VoIP going over to everything over to IP.

29
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.470
And we look forward to
hearing from you all.

30
00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.200
Yeah, so
takeaway is that show us some cool stuff.

31
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.110
>> Yeah, make something awesome.

32
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.110
>> Make something awesome.

33
00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:21.050
>> Maybe profit from it.

34
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.880
>> Yeah and then share.

35
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:23.560
>> Yeah.

36
00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.400
>> But cool, so
