00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:04.050
Now, we're gonna go ahead and
talk about the SipManager.

2
00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:08.910
So, previously we talked about
the SipProfile which is just,

3
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.690
as a reminder, your user name,
your domain, and your password.

4
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.990
And then, so now,
here in the SipManager we

5
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.550
will use that SipProfile to
create phone calls basically.

6
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.780
So on the sites here,
SipMananger's used to manage calls.

7
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.000
And it makes it possible for a different
class call, the SipAudioCalls to occur.

8
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.369
And the SipAudioCalls are the actual
outgoing or incoming phone calls.

9
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.510
There's also something similar
called the SipSessions.

10
00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.460
They're both very similar if you
look a take a look at documentation,

11
00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.270
which I'll go over in a second.

12
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.510
They both can be instantiated
using the SipManager, and

13
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.980
they're both the calling action.

14
00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.750
But they, even though very similar,

15
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.830
they have a couple internal
methods that differ.

16
00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:58.730
So based on.

17
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.370
Your applications
are what you want to use,

18
00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.640
what kind of phone calls you want to make.

19
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.010
You have to make a choice between
the Sip Audio calls or the SipSessions.

20
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.718
So like we did in the last video we'll
go ahead and dive into the computer and

21
00:01:14.718 --> 00:01:20.046
take a look at the documentation regarding
the SipManager and the related classes.

22
00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:27.909
All right, so right here, remember you
guys can just Google SipManager android,

23
00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:30.800
and it should come up as
a first search result.

24
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.050
So, in here the Class Overview.

25
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.750
So, the Sit Manager will provide APIs for
the Sip tasks,

26
00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:44.160
such as initiating Sip connections This
is what I was talking about earlier,

27
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.800
how the SIP manager will control
your phone calls, or in other words,

28
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.210
your SIP audio calls or your SIP sessions.

29
00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.080
So here you see you can create a SIP
session ready for making calls or

30
00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.920
listening for incoming calls, or you can
also create right here, SIP audio calls.

31
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.040
When you sit, when you tell
the manager to make an audio call or

32
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.980
take in an audio call.

33
00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:13.590
So remember what I said before with how
the SIP manager uses your SIP profile?

34
00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.550
So it'll use a SIP profile to listen to,

35
00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.970
maybe you decide to make an outgoing
call with the SIP profile.

36
00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.930
So that's how the,
it'd be a SIP audio call and

37
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.670
then Maybe someones decides to call you,
the manager will listen in and

38
00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.700
listen to incoming information and
be able to take that audio call as well.

39
00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.620
So let's just go ahead and
take a look at the SipSession, first.

40
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.900
So, yeah you can get a SipSession
from Sip Manager with the create

41
00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.250
Sip Session method.

42
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.970
So, right here you can see the sub-section
has things like the answerCall.

43
00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.770
You can end the call you
can get a caller ID.

44
00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.610
You can get your own profile.

45
00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.280
Or you can get the profile the person
you're calling or who's calling you.

46
00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.920
Things like that.

47
00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.485
And like I said before it's
also very similar to the.

48
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.744
Let's see here, SipManager.

49
00:03:07.744 --> 00:03:09.346
Slimmer to the SipAudioCall.

50
00:03:12.762 --> 00:03:13.461
So, like I said,

51
00:03:13.461 --> 00:03:15.989
let's say you can instantiate
this class with the SipManager.

52
00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:19.025
You have things like answering calls or

53
00:03:19.025 --> 00:03:24.230
ending the call, getting your profile or
the other profile.

54
00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.250
You could also things, you could also do
some extra things like hold the call or

55
00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.990
mute yourself, make a call, take a call.

56
00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:34.230
You know, whatever.

57
00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.370
So, that basically will

58
00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:42.420
cover the main classes that
you'll need for your VOIP app.

59
00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.970
Which we'll talk about in
the next lesson to come.

60
00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.400
So, sit tight, review all these things.

61
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.170
Familiarize yourself a bit more with it.

62
00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.330
And be ready to do some programming.
