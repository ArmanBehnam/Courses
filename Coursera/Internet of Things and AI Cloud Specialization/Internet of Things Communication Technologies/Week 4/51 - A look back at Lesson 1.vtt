00:00:00.673 --> 00:00:04.448
So, now you've made it to the end of the
lesson and you know what we usually do?

2
00:00:04.448 --> 00:00:05.797
We'll take a look back or

3
00:00:05.797 --> 00:00:09.770
have a little summary of what
you've learned in this lesson.

4
00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:11.960
So, first we talked
about the SipProfile and

5
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:17.230
how it uses the SipProfile.Builder
to create your profile so you can

6
00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:23.020
have some kind of account
that ties in the phone calls.

7
00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.560
And then we talked about the SipManager
which will create the SipAudioCalls or

8
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.190
it will create a SipSession
to have your phone calls.

9
00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:36.334
Now, remember hopefully
you've actually gone and

10
00:00:36.334 --> 00:00:39.448
looked at the Android documentation.

11
00:00:39.448 --> 00:00:41.857
This'll be very important for, say,

12
00:00:41.857 --> 00:00:46.456
if you wanna create more robust programs,
or you wanna be a programmer, or

13
00:00:46.456 --> 00:00:51.280
you're some kind of computer scientist,
software engineer, etc., etc.

14
00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.825
This will be helpful because you'll now
be able to look up documentation and

15
00:00:55.825 --> 00:01:00.030
then figure out what kind of class or
what kind of object you wanna use.

16
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.690
Or maybe you were trying to
write some kind of code and

17
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.490
then it gives you some errors.

18
00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:07.247
You're all like, man,
I don't know why that's happened.

19
00:01:07.247 --> 00:01:07.769
What the heck?

20
00:01:07.769 --> 00:01:09.300
What's going on?

21
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.110
So, you just need to go to documentation,
it'll tell you right there.

22
00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.530
Maybe you put a character in where
it should have been an integer.

23
00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.750
Something like that.

24
00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.838
And so with that kind of lesson
hopefully you'll be a better programmer.

25
00:01:22.838 --> 00:01:25.670
And then we'll see you next time
where we will actually build and

26
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.007
then run the app on the Dragonboard 410c.
