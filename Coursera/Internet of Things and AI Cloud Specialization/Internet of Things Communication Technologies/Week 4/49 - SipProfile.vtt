00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:01.900
So, let's go ahead and

2
00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:05.010
get started about this, let's start
it talking about the SipProfile.

3
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.430
So, you guys can go ahead and
pause the slide show, pause the video,

4
00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:12.790
check out the slide and read over it.

5
00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.560
This is just a really general and

6
00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.630
broad overview of what
the SipProfile class does.

7
00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.030
But what we're gonna do in
setting the rest of the video is

8
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:28.030
go into the inter documentation and
take a look at what these classes do,

9
00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:33.750
I feel this is important
because it's good practise

10
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.640
to familiarize yourself
with reading documentation

11
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.660
regarding classes you you may use so
you know like You know

12
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.000
how this class is gonna be implemented or
what's it good for, things like that.

13
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.680
So, we'll go ahead and
get started right now.

14
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.760
So, first we'll talk about the SIP
profile class really quickly.

15
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.460
Right here, oh, you can find these
classes by just typing in the class name.

16
00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.610
So, SipProfile into Google.

17
00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:02.340
Type in SipProfile Android.

18
00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.339
It should be the first search result.

19
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:06.690
All right, so here we go.

20
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.250
SipProfile, the Class Overview right here

21
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.240
will give you a basic overview
of what the entire class does.

22
00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.970
So, what's its purpose.

23
00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.460
So, the SIP profile will define a SIP
profile, including the SIP account,

24
00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:23.990
which is the user name.

25
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.910
The domain and server information,
so where your account is hosted.

26
00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.268
And it also has things
like passwords as well,

27
00:01:30.268 --> 00:01:34.086
if it's a local account where you're
gonna be the one using that account.

28
00:01:37.174 --> 00:01:42.055
So, those are the main parts about
the SIP profile, but to create your SIP

29
00:01:42.055 --> 00:01:46.955
profile you need something called
the SipProfile builder, right here.

30
00:01:46.955 --> 00:01:48.163
So, we'll go ahead and click on that.

31
00:01:48.163 --> 00:01:50.700
And then we'll go into
SipProfile.Builder class.

32
00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.630
Later on you'll see that we'll be using
this class to create your local zip

33
00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:01.870
profile as something you can use
to call different Sip accounts.

34
00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.030
So, like I said you guys just
go ahead go through these go

35
00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.590
through these two documents
on the Android website.

36
00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.350
It'll help you familiarize yourself
with what's to come later on for

37
00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:20.800
your own SIP app.

38
00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.740
And next, we'll go over the SipManager,

39
00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.970
which will manage your phone calls and
your SIP sessions.
