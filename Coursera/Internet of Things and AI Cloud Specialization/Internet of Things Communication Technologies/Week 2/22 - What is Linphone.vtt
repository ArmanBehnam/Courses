1
00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.960
So Randy, what is Linphone?

2
00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:07.020
>> Well, Linphone is simply an open
source software, VoIP software,

3
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.381
that we've mentioned probably
a thousand times by now.

4
00:00:10.381 --> 00:00:12.333
>> [LAUGH] Thousand, yeah.

5
00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:12.914
All right.

6
00:00:12.914 --> 00:00:13.517
>> At least.

7
00:00:13.517 --> 00:00:14.620
>> At least, at least.

8
00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.263
So, yeah as Randy says, there you go,
there's a little list of kinda some fun

9
00:00:18.263 --> 00:00:22.210
facts about Linphone and before we go over
that, I just wanna kinda mention, yeah.

10
00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.920
So, Linphone, open source, awesome and

11
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.160
available on all of those platforms,
pretty much everything.

12
00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.063
I can't really think of any
other big one [CROSSTALK]

13
00:00:32.063 --> 00:00:32.733
>> At least all the major

14
00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:33.409
platforms, right?

15
00:00:33.409 --> 00:00:34.431
>> Yeah, all the major platforms.

16
00:00:34.431 --> 00:00:39.120
So, you have you have iOS, Android,
the two major mobile platforms.

17
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.280
>> Yeah.
>> Then you have

18
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.850
Windows Phone which is kind of
trying to break through there.

19
00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:44.450
>> Yeah.

20
00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.695
>> Linux and Linux Desktop,
Windows Desktop and the OSX.

21
00:00:48.695 --> 00:00:49.300
>> Mm-hm.

22
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.860
>> Right, so the Mac desktop.

23
00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.562
Now, this just creates so
many possibilities for the developer,

24
00:00:54.562 --> 00:00:56.556
because all of this is open source.

25
00:00:56.556 --> 00:01:00.145
You can go in there,
grab this VoIP software, and

26
00:01:00.145 --> 00:01:04.939
essentially mold it to whatever you
want and put it on your device.

27
00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:08.313
>> Yeah, we mentioned many
times before with the Linphone

28
00:01:08.313 --> 00:01:10.969
open source software that you downloaded,

29
00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:15.579
that you probably should have downloaded
if you were in module one, right?

30
00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:16.171
>> Yeah.

31
00:01:16.171 --> 00:01:19.169
>> Yeah, so
then it has all the UI code in it.

32
00:01:19.169 --> 00:01:23.786
It has all the core engine,
what VoIP needs to run, the SIP stacks or

33
00:01:23.786 --> 00:01:26.635
your SIP account, all the other things.

34
00:01:26.635 --> 00:01:30.317
>> Yeah, so
essentially with this software,

35
00:01:30.317 --> 00:01:33.499
you have a program that was designed,

36
00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:39.379
that takes care of all of the core
functionalities of a VoIP software.

37
00:01:39.379 --> 00:01:44.340
But also allows you to manipulate or
change the UI, like Randy just said.

38
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.782
So, you have pretty much
access to everything, and

39
00:01:46.782 --> 00:01:49.623
you can make a VOIP software,
just make it your own, right?

40
00:01:49.623 --> 00:01:50.856
>> Extend it.

41
00:01:50.856 --> 00:01:56.330
>> Yeah, cool, so Linphone,
very cool software.

42
00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.910
We highly recommend you downloading it and
trying it out on your Dragonboard 410C,

43
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.620
whether you're running Ubuntu or
whether you're running Android.

44
00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.710
We are going to go over the set
up process in a second.

45
00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:13.100
But yeah, it'll give you a nice chance
to kind of see what's going on there.

46
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.080
All right, from the website,
from the Linphone website.

47
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.770
You can kind of see a little chart, kind
of like a, what is it, like a cake chart.

48
00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.460
>> Yeah, so you see how everything
stacks on top of each other and

49
00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:25.890
how they all interact in a way.

50
00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.560
>> Yeah, so
how everything is interacting and

51
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.190
then stacked on top of
the operating system itself.

52
00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.950
Now, we're not gonna
go too much into this.

53
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.720
I just think it's interesting for
you to take a look at it.

54
00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.420
The architecture of everything and
how it uses the SIP,

55
00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.426
uses the codecs,
uses the real time transfer.

56
00:02:43.426 --> 00:02:49.121
And then takes the libraries that it made,
for all the core functionalities and

57
00:02:49.121 --> 00:02:53.458
the UI and just stacks it all on
top of each other and it works.

58
00:02:53.458 --> 00:02:53.958
>> Right.

59
00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:55.820
>> So, you have access to all this.

60
00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.730
You can get the source code,

61
00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.470
wanted to talk a little bit
though about the Lib library.

62
00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.310
This is kind of your core library.

63
00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.700
It's in charge of all
the functionalities of Linphone.

64
00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.860
Now, you can go in there and mess with
this stuff or you can go in there and

65
00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:11.730
use some of the stuff.

66
00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.420
Take it and apply it to what we're
building later on in this course.

67
00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.180
Maybe our application isn't
intricate enough for you.

68
00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.465
Go in there and learn how the developers
made some really cool stuff.

69
00:03:22.465 --> 00:03:27.744
>> Maybe you wanna implement some kind
of instant messaging through Wi-Fi

70
00:03:27.744 --> 00:03:32.774
instead of your text messaging data
network or something like that?

71
00:03:32.774 --> 00:03:33.296
>> Yeah.

72
00:03:33.296 --> 00:03:36.839
>> Just add to this app, download it on
your phone, put it on your Dragonboard and

73
00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:37.882
just text each other.

74
00:03:37.882 --> 00:03:41.508
>> Yeah, essentially,
it's a bullet point there,

75
00:03:41.508 --> 00:03:46.397
but it makes it possible for
anyone to take an application of theirs,

76
00:03:46.397 --> 00:03:51.902
whether it's a game, I don't know,
just any application you can think of.

77
00:03:51.902 --> 00:03:53.481
Boggle that we went over earlier.

78
00:03:53.481 --> 00:03:54.395
>> [LAUGH]
>> And

79
00:03:54.395 --> 00:03:56.780
if you want to implement
some form of communication.

80
00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.124
Say like he's playing Boggle at his house
and I'm playing Boggle at my house, and

81
00:04:00.124 --> 00:04:02.560
we wanna chat with each other
while we're playing Boggle.

82
00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.649
Well, inside the Linphone source code,
there's a way to use it and

83
00:04:06.649 --> 00:04:08.820
implement it on your application.

84
00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:09.737
>> Right, exactly.

85
00:04:09.737 --> 00:04:12.220
>> So, yeah,
we're not gonna be doing that.

86
00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:13.350
We're going too deep into it.

87
00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.815
But we just wanna kinda let
you know that it's possible.

88
00:04:15.815 --> 00:04:16.512
>> Possible, yeah.

89
00:04:16.512 --> 00:04:18.603
>> Yeah, so
another little kind of snippet here,

90
00:04:18.603 --> 00:04:20.762
just going a little bit
more into the [CROSSTALK].

91
00:04:20.762 --> 00:04:21.784
>> [CROSSTALK] Yeah?

92
00:04:21.784 --> 00:04:25.350
>> Yeah, the three little
things in the middle layers.

93
00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.050
We told you RTP would come back.

94
00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:28.070
What's good about RTP?

95
00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:35.070
>> Yeah, so we would need to use
Real-time Transport Protocol, because

96
00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:38.580
when you're talking to someone on the
phone, you probably want it in real time.

97
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.939
What's the point of telling someone oh,
I see a really nice car, check it out?

98
00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:45.843
Or you should like, I don't know,
I don't know, whatever.

99
00:04:45.843 --> 00:04:48.331
>> [LAUGH]
>> This crazy thing happened but

100
00:04:48.331 --> 00:04:52.308
on the other end, they receive it,
say, like ten seconds later.

101
00:04:52.308 --> 00:04:54.052
And now [CROSSTALK]
>> I might as well just

102
00:04:54.052 --> 00:04:54.715
leave a voice mail.

103
00:04:54.715 --> 00:04:55.955
>> Exactly.

104
00:04:55.955 --> 00:04:59.030
[LAUGH]
>> Cool, so anyways, there you go.

105
00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.390
That's the whole idea of what Linphone is.

106
00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:08.540
The open source aspect of it is amazing,
all the platforms you can use it on.

107
00:05:10.922 --> 00:05:16.950
>> How would you say, the intricate nature
of the program put in a simple way for you

108
00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:21.020
to manipulate either the user interface or
the basic core functionalities.

109
00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.920
Everything's there for you.

110
00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:25.200
Take some time, check it out and
we'll see you in the next video.
