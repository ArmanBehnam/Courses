00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:01.900
For the last time on this module,

2
00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:05.070
we are going to look back at
what happened in this lesson.

3
00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:07.920
So, we started out by
just talking about SIP,

4
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.250
Randy did a great job at kind of
explaining the different layers of SIP.

5
00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:13.030
SIP stack.

6
00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:14.410
>> Yeah, then we went a little bit deeper,

7
00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.650
talking about the specific
protocol operations.

8
00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.250
Backing the SIPs.

9
00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.780
>> Yeah.
>> Or Search Initiation Protocol.

10
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.820
>> Yeah and then looked at
the network elements of SIP I guess.

11
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.820
So, all the stuff was basically pulled
from the internet very easily to

12
00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:31.630
find again.

13
00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.610
>> Then finally we went over SIP
messages which are pretty important.

14
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.710
Pretty vital if you
wanna make some kind of.

15
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.210
Application using you know,

16
00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.560
SIP requests and responses just
like we did before with HTTP.

17
00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.150
>> Yeah.
So now, you know,

18
00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:52.230
you've kind of gotten at least
a higher-level view of what SIP is,

19
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.550
what VOIP is maybe gotten
to practice with Linphone,

20
00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.100
making some calls from your DragonBoard to
your other phones or your other devices.

21
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.680
I've had some fun with that.

22
00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:08.540
So, now we have another module on
some more really cool theory stuff,

23
00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.300
codecs, how everything's
functioning on a lower level.

24
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.240
We're gonna go even lower.

25
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.550
Our professor is gonna take you at a very
really cool, through a cool view at codecs

26
00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.920
and DSP and such, but then after that,
we're gonna build up our application.

27
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.260
>> Yeah, be sure to stick around for that.

28
00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.650
>> Be sure to stick around for that
because that's where kind of all the meat

29
00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.750
is and we're gonna have some fun
>> Seeing what kind of stuff you guys come

30
00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.110
up with too using our kind of core code.

31
00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.300
But anyways, it's been fun.

32
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.445
We'll see you hopefully
in the next module.

33
00:01:39.445 --> 00:01:40.070
>> Mm-hm.

34
00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.300
>> And yeah,
keep on the discussion boards.

35
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.750
We love to hear your input.
