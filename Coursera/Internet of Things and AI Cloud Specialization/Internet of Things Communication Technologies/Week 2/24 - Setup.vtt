00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:02.040
Hey, everyone.

2
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.450
So we've been talking
about Linphone a lot.

3
00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:09.890
So, when do we get to start messing
around with it, playing with it?

4
00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:12.940
Before we even do that, though,
you'll need to set up the app.

5
00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:13.910
So that's what I'm here for.

6
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.990
If you're using Android, you'll need
to begin by booting up your board and

7
00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:21.989
going to the linphone.org website.

8
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:28.483
After that, you'll notice there's a
LINPHONE tab, under the Technical Corner.

9
00:00:28.483 --> 00:00:29.763
Go ahead and click on that.

10
00:00:29.763 --> 00:00:34.546
And then in that tab you'll
have another little menu for

11
00:00:34.546 --> 00:00:39.320
you to click on, or
the tab will be called DOWNLOADS.

12
00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.710
You click there, and
then you'll want to search for

13
00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.150
Linphone Android on Google Play and
the apk.

14
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.600
Since there's no Google Play
services on your device,

15
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.150
you'll have to click the apk download.

16
00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.230
Once that's finished, you click it, you'll
download it, once it finishes downloading,

17
00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.510
you'll just simply need to click
on the download and click install.

18
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.237
Now, if you're using Ubuntu,
it's a little bit simpler.

19
00:01:06.237 --> 00:01:09.946
Just go ahead and
launch your on board terminal, and

20
00:01:09.946 --> 00:01:14.752
start with sudo apt-get update,
then sudo apt-get upgrade, and

21
00:01:14.752 --> 00:01:17.891
then just sudo apt-get install linphone.

22
00:01:20.544 --> 00:01:25.033
So now that you've downloaded the app,
we're gonna need to

23
00:01:25.033 --> 00:01:29.840
register you on some kind of SIP
network for you to use the app.

24
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.820
So Linphone actually provides their own
SIP network for you to create an app.

25
00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.280
You can also use your own SIP account,
if you have one.

26
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.770
So you have your own SIP server, go ahead
and use that instead of the linphone one.

27
00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.010
But we'll just go ahead and

28
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.640
dive right into the free server
that they provide with you.

29
00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.890
You just need to go to linphone.org,
and then toward the bottom,

30
00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.690
bottom right, under Free SIP Service box,
you'll click create or

31
00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.180
manage your account, go ahead and
create a new account,

32
00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:06.010
enter all the necessary information,
and you're pretty much ready.

33
00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:07.920
You'll go into your app and log in.

34
00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:14.720
Now that I think about it, the app also
has its own account creation wizard, so

35
00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.140
when you first launch the app,
it'll ask you to go ahead and

36
00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.710
either log into an old account or
make a new one.

37
00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.700
So you can go ahead and
do that, use those steps, or

38
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.680
you can just do it online through your
computer or the browser on your board.

39
00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.000
And with that,
set up should all be finished,

40
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.490
and you're ready to go and mess around.

41
00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:36.720
Go ahead and call whoever you'd like.
