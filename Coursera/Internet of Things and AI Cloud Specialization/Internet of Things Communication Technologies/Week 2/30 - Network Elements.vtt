1
00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.220
So, we went over the, the-
>> SIP and the protocols.

2
00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.310
>> SIP and the protocols,
or the operations of SIP.

3
00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:14.585
Now, we're gonna go into a kind
of one little layer lower, right?

4
00:00:14.585 --> 00:00:17.375
Kinda talking about some of the elements
that make up the network or

5
00:00:17.375 --> 00:00:20.575
the SIP operations that
you're gonna be using.

6
00:00:20.575 --> 00:00:25.735
So, you can see up on the screen or
on your slides right there.

7
00:00:25.735 --> 00:00:31.885
We have these six kind of elements
that make up what we're doing.

8
00:00:31.885 --> 00:00:34.210
Now, There are more.

9
00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.540
But these are kind of the ones that
we thought would be more interesting.

10
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.960
So, we're gonna kinda just briefly
go over these things, right?

11
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.420
So, user agent, proxy server.

12
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.720
What is all these stuff?

13
00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:49.540
Registrar, redirect server,
session border control, and the gateway.

14
00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.160
Now, you'll kinda see, this is kinda cool,
what it leads into but you'll see.

15
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.850
So, user agent, what is a user agent?

16
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.440
The user agent, first of the network
elements that we're going to talk about,

17
00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:09.520
is essentially the object that
manages your SIP session.

18
00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.390
Now, I'm not gonna go too
in depth about this, but

19
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.200
that's pretty much the gist of it.

20
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.300
It controls all the functions that you
would implement that essentially makes

21
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:23.160
your SIP session Kind of similar to
what a phone call would be like.

22
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.380
>> Yeah.
>> All right.

23
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.540
So, that's enough about the user agent.

24
00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.790
You have a proxy server.

25
00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.710
The proxy server, interesting little
thing about the proxy server, and

26
00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.420
I have a little animation or.

27
00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:35.600
Something after this.

28
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.710
But it's the intermediate or
intermediary object or

29
00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.930
entity in between you and
the person you're trying to connect with.

30
00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.230
>> Yeah, in between the end points.

31
00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.150
>> In between the two end points,
there you go.

32
00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:55.890
Yeah, so proxy servers in a lot of cases,
for instance

33
00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.110
imagine you were a You are, you're
a subscriber to a telephone company or

34
00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.430
a cell phone company and
you didn't pay your bill, right?

35
00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.390
Well, you're trying to call so-and-so and
the proxy server's not gonna let

36
00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.535
you because you didn't pay Pay your bill,
right?

37
00:02:11.535 --> 00:02:14.745
So, it's kind of like that intermediary
buffer, in a lot of cases that's

38
00:02:14.745 --> 00:02:19.555
what's happening, like that's how
the control is maintained is.

39
00:02:19.555 --> 00:02:21.145
>> Right.
>> Through these proxy servers.

40
00:02:21.145 --> 00:02:25.345
They're also used to protect people too,
so I mean like, there's lots of uses for

41
00:02:25.345 --> 00:02:26.895
them, you can look up online.

42
00:02:26.895 --> 00:02:30.205
>> Yeah, probably like,
maybe like call blocking.

43
00:02:30.205 --> 00:02:32.730
>> Call blocking, lots of stuff like that.

44
00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.780
But, yeah, so in short,
you can kinda see up there,

45
00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.700
ensure request is sent to another
entity closer to target user.

46
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.630
Now, that's kinda like
the routing of the proxy servers.

47
00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.770
Now let's see this alimentation we have
here, all right so we have Alice and

48
00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:56.710
Bob Alice wants to call Bob, so Alice
says, ask Bob what the current time is.

49
00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.120
Goes to the proxy server and
the proxy servers says,

50
00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.680
Bob, what's the current time?

51
00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.830
And then Bob says, the time is 7 PM.

52
00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.600
We'll go through the proxy server and

53
00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.990
then the proxy says, oh,
Bob says the time is 7 PM.

54
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.330
So, you can kind of get the picture of
what the proxy server is doing there.

55
00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.130
>> Right.
[COUGH] Excuse me, sorry.

56
00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:14.410
>> Yeah.
[LAUGH] Yeah,

57
00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.230
so you kinda get the picture what
the box server's doing there.

58
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.900
>> Yeah, it's a good inter-.

59
00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.730
>> Intermediary.

60
00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.550
>> [LAUGH]
>> Yeah, intermediate.

61
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:25.840
>> Intermediary.

62
00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:26.570
All right, cool.

63
00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:27.910
>> Exactly.
>> Yeah,

64
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.280
so next element that we
have is the registrar.

65
00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.300
The registrar is a SIP endpoint.

66
00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.690
And it accept the REGISTER requests.

67
00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.180
So, you register say your username or
whatever.

68
00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.770
It accepts the request from you.

69
00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:51.970
If for instance you're not
registered with registrar.

70
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:53.310
Well, then there is an issue.

71
00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.230
So, then you might need to
register with the Registrar and

72
00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.650
then in which case then it has your
information and so on and so forth.

73
00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.560
Right?
So, this is just another piece of SIP.

74
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.280
Next element is redirect server.

75
00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.750
So, I'm just gonna read this.

76
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.950
Redirect server allows proxy
servers to direct SIP sessions

77
00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.170
Invitation to external domains.

78
00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.840
Right?
So,

79
00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.880
you can kind of follow the chart up there.

80
00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.540
Not so easy to follow.

81
00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.330
But this is off of Wikipedia.

82
00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.445
I'd recommend checking it out,
going down to.

83
00:04:26.445 --> 00:04:28.395
Just clicking on the little sub-link for

84
00:04:28.395 --> 00:04:30.635
redirect server if you
wanna know more about this.

85
00:04:30.635 --> 00:04:35.345
So, not such a super big deal for
at least what we're gonna be working on.

86
00:04:35.345 --> 00:04:38.545
But, thought it was a little bit
interesting when it gets to a more

87
00:04:38.545 --> 00:04:39.975
intricate system.

88
00:04:39.975 --> 00:04:43.141
Now, [CROSSTALK] Gateway in
particular is what I like.

89
00:04:43.141 --> 00:04:45.215
But yeah, these are the last two elements.

90
00:04:45.215 --> 00:04:48.975
Now, you have the session border
controller, which I'm just gonna read,

91
00:04:48.975 --> 00:04:54.150
exerts control over VoIP signaling,
setup during and tear down.

92
00:04:54.150 --> 00:05:01.136
So the border controller is essentially
kind of monitoring all of this and

93
00:05:01.136 --> 00:05:06.240
yeah, so
the border controller's essentially

94
00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:11.030
monitoring all of this and
making sure that everything's going right.

95
00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:16.230
Nothing's going out of bounds or
maybe not losing stuff, things like that.

96
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:19.140
>> Exactly.
Then the last one is the gateway.

97
00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:20.790
The gateway we've talked about.

98
00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:27.550
You know the PSTN, the public switch
telephone network, that's a gateway.

99
00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:32.330
So, this basically takes you
from your SIP network to

100
00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:37.590
the public switch telephone network and
backwards, right?

101
00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:40.300
>> Yeah.
You know how we mentioned if you're on

102
00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.190
the VoIP network, or on the Internet, how
are you gonna call someone on the local

103
00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:45.600
landline or on the telephone network?

104
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.250
And that's what the gateways are for.

105
00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.990
>> Yeah and
SIP has all this integrated into it,

106
00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:53.540
so that's why it's such a strong
>> You know and

107
00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:57.280
prominent protocol to use in using VoIP.

108
00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.940
>> In using VoIP, yeah.

109
00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:02.530
>> Anyways, I hope that wasn't
too confusing or too bad.

110
00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:09.150
We just wanted to walk you through some
interesting things that we found and

111
00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:11.700
hopefully you found it useful as well.

112
00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:15.090
We will see you in the next videos,
and stay tuned.
