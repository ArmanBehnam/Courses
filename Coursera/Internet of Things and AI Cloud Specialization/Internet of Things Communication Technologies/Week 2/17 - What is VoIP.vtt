00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:02.180
Greetings everyone.

2
00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:05.090
Here in this section,
we're gonna go over, what is VoIP?

3
00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:06.420
Why do we use VoIP?

4
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.990
How do we use VoIP?

5
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.436
>> So VoIP, V-O-I-P.

6
00:00:11.436 --> 00:00:13.080
V-O-I-P stands for

7
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.380
Voice Over Internet Protocol, and
it's pronounced just as you see it, voyp.

8
00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.770
At the very core, it's essentially
a phone service that works off

9
00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.100
the digital network, for
instance, the Internet.

10
00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:31.320
>> Even though VoIP tends to use the
Internet to communicate from a computer

11
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.680
to a computer or phone to phone,
you don't actually need the Internet.

12
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.890
This is because we just need Internet
protocols to allow for the communication.

13
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.410
Protocol is just a set of rules so

14
00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.890
we can communicate with the audio
signals or the digital signals.

15
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.620
>> Say,
if I wanted to make a call to Randy,

16
00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.370
all I would need to do is establish
how I was gonna send the message.

17
00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.580
I would say,
I'm gonna send the message this way and

18
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.190
Randy's computer would say oh,
I'm gonna receive it this way.

19
00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.180
As long as those rules are established,
we can make a VoIP call and

20
00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:00.980
as long as they're connected on a network,
also.

21
00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.640
You don't necessarily need
the Internet to make that call.

22
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.290
>> Just some way to connect the computers.

23
00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.596
>> The benefits of using
Internet protocols,

24
00:01:09.596 --> 00:01:14.710
in general, is that it supports corporate,
private, public.

25
00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.160
It can be transmitted over cable or
wireless networks.

26
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.500
So it's used in many different mediums and
is very versatile in that sense.

27
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.430
>> Let's go ahead and
check out why we use it.

28
00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.490
>> Usually,
in a traditional phone service,

29
00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.215
let's say you're making
an international phone call,

30
00:01:29.215 --> 00:01:30.700
you're usually charged on the minute.

31
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.930
If you're gonna call India or China,
every minute you talk to your relatives or

32
00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:41.830
someone down there, every minute you talk,
you have to pay a certain number of cents.

33
00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.020
When you're using VoIP,
that charge is cut down.

34
00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.230
You're paying on a monthly rate.

35
00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:48.070
So you can just make a call,
talk for hours on end,

36
00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.560
and not have to worry about
those minutely charges.

37
00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.320
>> This is usually very
appealing to big businesses.

38
00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.440
Instead of being charged by the minute,
or mainly because say it's

39
00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.030
night time in the certain country,
say the U.S., but at that time,

40
00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.240
most people aren't working so instead your
phone calls for customer service will be

41
00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.615
sent outside of the country,
say somewhere in Asia where it's morning.

42
00:02:12.615 --> 00:02:13.895
>> Mm-hm.

43
00:02:13.895 --> 00:02:18.300
>> That'll help the company dodge
any international fees, it just uses

44
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.905
the Internet, they just gonna pay their
monthly Internet bill and they're good.

45
00:02:21.905 --> 00:02:26.890
>> These different applications
support call forwarding,

46
00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.740
voice mailbox, call records etc,
and has many different features.

47
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.410
>> There are a ton of free ones too, such
as Skype and you've probably used Skype,

48
00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:36.690
a lot of people use Skype.

49
00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.230
Skype has that call-forwarding,
has that messaging.

50
00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.050
You can have voice calls-
>> You can even have international calls

51
00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.660
on Skype.

52
00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.570
>> Call record, everything.

53
00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:47.540
That ties into the hows.

54
00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:53.190
>> On a traditional phone service,
you're making an analog audio signal.

55
00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.120
Every time you're talking, analog audio
signals are getting sent to the tower and

56
00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.050
that tower carries on that signal
to the next one and so on.

57
00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.600
However, when you're using VoIP,
that analog audio signal gets

58
00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.010
changed into digital data and
that digital data is then transmitted.

59
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.590
The benefit of using digital data over
analog audio signals is that digital data

60
00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.400
can carry much more information
than traditional analog signals.

61
00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.670
So you can do voice calls,
audio calls both at the same time.

62
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.700
It gives you much more
freedom to work with there.

63
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.340
>> In the following lesson, we'll check
out these flavors more in depth but

64
00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.560
basically, the three main
things that use voice

65
00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.170
communication would be the ATAs,
which are the analog telephone adapters.

66
00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.020
That just converts your
traditional landline

67
00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.480
network into using the VoIP networks.

68
00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.260
Then there's IP phones, which are just
Internet phones and then finally,

69
00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.330
the normal computer
interfaces such as Skype.

70
00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.830
>> Right.

71
00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.640
Here's a little diagram of
how VoIP basically works.

72
00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.250
You can use your computer or your
telephone, it'll go through the Internet.

73
00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:11.030
And then that Internet signal will be
received on a different computer or

74
00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:12.860
telephone and you just talk like that.

75
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.730
>> What are some of the disadvantages and

76
00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:20.370
advantages as compared to
the traditional telephone service?

77
00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.120
>> We already went over the biggest
advantage of using VoIP,

78
00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.250
it's the cost benefit.

79
00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.090
You don't have to pay so

80
00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.040
much money to do international calls or
calls that are long distance.

81
00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.760
However, another very big advantage
of VoIP is that it's higher quality.

82
00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.250
With a traditional phone signal, you might
not get the best clarity in voice or

83
00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:41.050
video and that's because you don't
have that much bandwidth to work with.

84
00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.440
However, using VoIP, since you're
sending the data digitally, and

85
00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.550
because the Wi-Fi bandwidth is much
bigger than traditional phone bandwidth,

86
00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.850
you can give more data
to the receiving end.

87
00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.980
You can do voice, audio, and it comes
out much more clearly on the other side.

88
00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:57.480
>> Right.

89
00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.750
Some disadvantages.

90
00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.640
Usually when there's a power outage,

91
00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:07.200
you lose service because usually your
router goes out or something else,

92
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:12.345
unless your router is connected to
some kind of back-up power generator.

93
00:05:12.345 --> 00:05:18.200
Normally, on regular telephone networks,
when you make an emergency call to like,

94
00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:22.085
say, 911, they'll be able to pinpoint
your location using the cell towers.

95
00:05:22.085 --> 00:05:24.160
>> Mm-hm.
>> But, with Internet,

96
00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:29.390
with VoIP applications,
say an IP phone, it will be much harder

97
00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:32.470
to pinpoint your location through your
Internet, it tends to be more difficult.

98
00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.970
>> Right.
>> Finally, there's no directory service.

99
00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.190
Normal telephone companies will provide
a phone book so you can look up somebody.

100
00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:42.620
>> Right.
>> Find the number, be able to call them.

101
00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.420
>> But as of right now,
there's no established directory service.

102
00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:49.820
Hopefully, there might be one in the
future but as of right now, you can't just

103
00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:53.550
look at a store that you wanna call and
find the VoIP number to call them with.

104
00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:56.490
>> At least, that's not too bad
because we can just easily exchange

105
00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:00.010
contact information and
add it to our free contact book.

106
00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:00.510
>> Exactly.

107
00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:05.266
>> With that,
that wraps up the why, the what,

108
00:06:05.266 --> 00:06:08.610
the hows of VoIP, and
we'll see you next time.
