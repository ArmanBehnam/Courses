00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:06.070
So another cool aspect of SIP
would be the SIP messages.

2
00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:08.720
>> Yeah, so like, so let's just dive in.

3
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:13.674
SIP messages are basically HTTP syntax

4
00:00:13.674 --> 00:00:18.790
requests, or sorry, there's two parts
to the SIP tow, requests In response-

5
00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:20.456
>> Two kinds of SIP messages.

6
00:00:20.456 --> 00:00:23.427
>> Yeah.
>> Request SIPs or response SIPs and so

7
00:00:23.427 --> 00:00:27.480
you know, you make a request and
you get a response.

8
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.810
Simple enough.

9
00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.665
So and I think we mentioned
this much earlier in the lesson

10
00:00:32.665 --> 00:00:38.230
where the entire SIP message
has three different parts,

11
00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.945
the method, the request URI,
and the response code.

12
00:00:42.945 --> 00:00:47.890
So the method tells you
what kind of request it is.

13
00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.720
And then the URI is telling you,
where should I send this to?

14
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.120
Who do I send this to?

15
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.680
And it finally the responds,

16
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.260
it gives you a response code,
what kind of message you're getting back.

17
00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.180
Maybe you get an error response
because you sent a bad message, or

18
00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.730
you get a good response.

19
00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:04.589
Something like that.

20
00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.029
>> Yeah, and
you know just like Randy said,

21
00:01:07.029 --> 00:01:11.788
maybe you wanna refer to the first video
of this lesson when we went over all that.

22
00:01:11.788 --> 00:01:19.050
But, up on the screen or on your slides,
you can see some of these SIP requests.

23
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.795
And the next slide is the SIP response,
or SIP responds.

24
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.100
But just take a look at them.

25
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.310
It's interesting.

26
00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.870
Maybe put them on your cheat sheet.

27
00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:37.810
Might be in the quiz question for
this module, for this lesson maybe.

28
00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.300
But yeah it's just interesting
to take a look at.

29
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.970
Pause the video, check it out.

30
00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.380
Go on the Wikipedia.

31
00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.270
Here's the next one, SIP response.

32
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.280
Yeah, anyways.

33
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.200
>> So like, these ten could be very useful
if you want to build a VoIP application or

34
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.180
some kind of SIP related
application where you

35
00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.980
need to send a request to some kind
of server or the other end point.

36
00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:06.000
And the endpoint will send
some kind of message back,

37
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.770
in which you could process that response
and do something with it in your program.

38
00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.550
>> Yeah, so
we just wanna go over this quickly,

39
00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.880
give you a little view of this stuff and
slightly explain it.

40
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.750
So yeah, I will see you in the next video,
the conclusion of this lesson.
