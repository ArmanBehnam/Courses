00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:04.810
Welcome back everyone to this-
>> New lesson.

2
00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:06.340
>> New lesson of this module.

3
00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:12.730
Our goal for this lesson is to relate
VoIP to the DragonBoard 410C, so to say.

4
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:18.020
>> We'll be introducing you to
the app we've been talking about.

5
00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.943
>> Linphone.
>> DVS lessons.

6
00:00:20.943 --> 00:00:26.150
>> For instance, say you didn't want
to build our application later on in

7
00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.750
this course, which we're gonna do, we're
gonna build a little Android application.

8
00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.600
You're gonna get to see
some VoIP stuff going on.

9
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.790
Say, you just wanted to
download a VoIP application and

10
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:33.912
communicate with your friends?

11
00:00:33.912 --> 00:00:37.660
We're gonna walk you through that process,
so let's just check this out.

12
00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:40.060
What is Linphone?

13
00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.670
We talked to you a little bit
about this VoIP application,

14
00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.820
we've been jittering about.

15
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.740
Talked to you about some of its features.

16
00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:52.725
>> Then afterwards, we're gonna show
you how to set it up, download it,

17
00:00:52.725 --> 00:00:55.966
register your accounts or
account maybe, and

18
00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:59.540
type walk you through
what Linphone looks like.

19
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.480
>> Its essentials.

20
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.930
This an almost a supplemental lesson.

21
00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.530
>> Little show and tell, maybe.

22
00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:12.820
>> A little show and tell.

23
00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.100
Hopefully, get you familiarized
with VoIP on another level,

24
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.500
a very simple application base level that
you can just go access it right away.

25
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.380
Find out if the audio on
your board is working.

26
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.430
Find out if everything's
functioning properly.

27
00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.270
>> See if you can make a phone call.

28
00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.040
>> See if you can make a phone call.

29
00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.395
This is something you should actually
probably just do anyways to test out your

30
00:01:35.395 --> 00:01:42.318
board using the VoIP services
of a well known application.

31
00:01:42.318 --> 00:01:43.560
>> Mm-hm.

32
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.139
>> Stay tuned,
we'll walk you through all those steps.
