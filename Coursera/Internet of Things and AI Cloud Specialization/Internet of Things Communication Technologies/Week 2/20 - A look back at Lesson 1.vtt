Hey everyone,
I hope you enjoyed this lesson, and

2
00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.800
lets take a quick look back at
what we introduced this lesson.

3
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.550
So, we started with what is VoIP,

4
00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:14.250
and we introduced new flavors of VoIP,
just touched on it on the surface.

5
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.150
>> What is VoIP?

6
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.940
Why do we use VoIP?

7
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.840
The flavors of VoIP.

8
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.450
>> We vent more into depth
of the different flavors,

9
00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.200
ATA, IP phone, voice computer,
computer calling.

10
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.130
>> And then finally, we covered some
common applications, interesting facts and

11
00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.800
how you can apply it to your own
projects using the DragonBoard.

12
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.170
Using whatever, you know?

13
00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.820
>> Right.

14
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.670
And so hopefully in the coming course,
the following courses,

15
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.370
you'll get to see more of this and
hope you stay tuned.
