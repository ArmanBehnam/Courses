00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:01.420
Hi everyone, let's go ahead and

2
00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:04.870
take a look back at what
we've done in this lesson.

3
00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:05.500
So, first off,

4
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.240
we started defining the VoIP app that
we've been talking about, Linphone.

5
00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.800
>> Yeah, we talked about it a little bit,

6
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:17.710
explained why it's a good app
to at least choose right now for

7
00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.000
the various platforms you'll be using,
especially since it's open source.

8
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:21.530
>> Right.

9
00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:23.800
Then we went over some of
the Linphone features,

10
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.920
just like the main features that
we thought were interesting.

11
00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.810
We got them off their website and kind of
hand picked some features that we thought

12
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.065
would be good for your application.

13
00:00:32.065 --> 00:00:34.540
>> Yeah, why is Linphone so attractive?

14
00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:35.610
Why did we want it?

15
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.020
Why even choose something else?

16
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.120
>> Yeah.
Yeah, exactly.

17
00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.490
>> And then, we showed you how to set
up the Linphone on your own device.

18
00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:47.900
Because, maybe you don't know how
to do it without Google Play Store.

19
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:54.020
>> Yeah, so Randy walked you through
getting the APK through your Android OS,

20
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.705
on your DragonBoard, you can just go
to the, I think it's Firefox browser.

21
00:00:57.705 --> 00:01:00.675
>> Yeah.
>> And just go to the website on Linphone,

22
00:01:00.675 --> 00:01:03.805
just click the APK thing,
download an installer, double-click that,

23
00:01:03.805 --> 00:01:04.475
you're all set.

24
00:01:04.475 --> 00:01:07.315
>> Yeah.
>> Ubuntu version,

25
00:01:07.315 --> 00:01:09.215
it's kind of self-explanatory but
you know,

26
00:01:09.215 --> 00:01:11.705
you've seen stuff like this
throughout the other courses.

27
00:01:11.705 --> 00:01:13.445
You could follow our
setup on this as well.

28
00:01:13.445 --> 00:01:16.125
And then we just walked you through
some of the essentials, you know,

29
00:01:16.125 --> 00:01:20.210
the high level user interface-
>> Right.

30
00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.150
>> Of the mobile version of Linphone.

31
00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.015
>> Yeah.
>> So, we hope you enjoyed it.

32
00:01:25.015 --> 00:01:28.730
>> Mm-hm.
>> And, you know, from here, we're gonna

33
00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.490
start going a little bit more in-depth on
>> On SIP.

34
00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.480
And hopefully,
eventually get you to build your own,

35
00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.980
>> Yeah, your own SIP application,

36
00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:37.760
your VoIP application.

37
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.010
>> Yeah, your own VoIP application
coming up soon in the modules to come.

38
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.650
So, we'll see you soon.
