00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:02.150
Hey, everyone.

2
00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:05.250
In this video we're going to be
talking about common applications and

3
00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:06.896
fun facts regarding VoIP.

4
00:00:06.896 --> 00:00:13.580
>> Right, so some, the simplest one
is the computer to computer VoIP.

5
00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.840
And you obviously know
there's ATA's in and IP's.

6
00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.978
Not much to talk about, just phones.

7
00:00:19.978 --> 00:00:24.500
And for Computer-to-Computer VoIPs
there's tons of programs out there.

8
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.260
>> Right.
>> And some big ones would be like Skype,

9
00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.530
Teamspeak, Ventrillo, Mumble, etc.

10
00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:35.050
>> And one big Computer-to-Computer VoIP
that we forgot to mention is

11
00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.040
the Dragonboard itself can do
Computer-to-Computer VoIP.

12
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.858
>> Of course it's an IP phone but
it can talk to other phones.

13
00:00:42.858 --> 00:00:44.270
>> Mm-hm.
>> Other Dragonboards.

14
00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:45.098
Computers.

15
00:00:45.098 --> 00:00:47.800
>> So, what Randy means by that is
on your DragonBoard you can have

16
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.170
two different operating systems.

17
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.010
You can have the Android operating
system or the Ubuntu operating system.

18
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.290
When you have the Android operating system
on the DragonBoard it basically functions

19
00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:57.500
as an IP phone.

20
00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.900
However when you load the Ubuntu
operating system on the DragonBoard,

21
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.580
you can do computer computer VoIP
calls using the DragonBoard.

22
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.200
>> So, as long as you have
the right software it'll be fine.

23
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.830
>> Right, and so as Randy was
mentioning earlier about Skype.

24
00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.460
Let's take a close look at
exactly how Skype works because

25
00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.900
it's quite a interesting
piece of software there.

26
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.320
So, Skype works off of
a peer-to-peer network, it's a P2P.

27
00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.990
So, if you haven't heard that
before basically what happens is,

28
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.500
let's say we're in a suburb somewhere and
there's a house that's making Skype calls.

29
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.130
Five houses down, there's another person
who has Skype loaded on their computer and

30
00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.310
then ten miles down,
someone else has a Skype.

31
00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.330
What happens is, if you're making
a call usually on the internet,

32
00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.400
when you're making a call on the internet,
it goes through the internet and

33
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.080
goes down to lines and

34
00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.660
goes to wherever you need to go, it
doesn't go to separate nodes in between.

35
00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.950
But what happens when you're using
VOIP is when you're making a call,

36
00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.310
it's gonna search for the closest computer
around you that's also using Skype.

37
00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.320
And it's gonna go to that computer.

38
00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.550
Transmit the data through their computer
to the next one, to the next one, and

39
00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:01.450
to the next one.

40
00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.600
So, let's say there's 100
houses between you and

41
00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.940
in the person you're trying to call.

42
00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.860
And all these 100 houses have some
type of Skype on their computer

43
00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:09.390
and they're using it.

44
00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.350
And what's gonna happen is your data that
you're trying to call or that you're

45
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.260
trying to have a video call with, that
data's gonna descend through 100 houses.

46
00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.860
And I know that sounds very complicated or
time consuming.

47
00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.890
But that actually makes
the process much faster.

48
00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.390
Because you don't have to send
the data over a very long range

49
00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.090
you can just do short range transmissions.

50
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.020
So, that's basically what
a peer to peer networking is.

51
00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.870
Basically a peer to a peer and
it's gonna go down the line that way.

52
00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.560
And basically what a peer to peer
network is, is that it's decentralized.

53
00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.790
There's no 1 central hub that
transmits the data everywhere.

54
00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.220
Every single person that's using it
serves as their own little node, and

55
00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.500
they all submit the data.

56
00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.230
It works in a community fashion.

57
00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:57.560
So, it's decentralized, it's distributed
and one interesting thing about Skype,

58
00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.450
it's a very interesting
algorithm that Skype developed,

59
00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.110
is that when you're making a Skype call,
say you're making it internationally,

60
00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.990
there might be a million people
using Skype in between, but

61
00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:11.600
what Skype does is it locates which
computers have the best Internet.

62
00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.420
So instead of trying to go through
computers that have kind of bad Internet,

63
00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.650
it only locates the one that
has really good Internet.

64
00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.280
And sense the information through them.

65
00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.410
So, it makes for a much faster call.

66
00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.780
And basically, Skype is a very
amazing piece of software that

67
00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.330
everyone's using nowadays.

68
00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:32.400
>> All right, so let's check out some
random facts or some cool facts we found.

69
00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:39.365
So first, we have here is, the first VoIP
call was made in 1974 on the ARPANET.

70
00:03:39.365 --> 00:03:41.240
>> Mm-hm.

71
00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.418
>> Which stands for
Advanced Projects Research Agency Network.

72
00:03:44.418 --> 00:03:46.338
>> Precursor to [CROSSTALK]
>> Precursor to today's internet.

73
00:03:46.338 --> 00:03:47.220
>> Yeah.

74
00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.250
And then next we have the gaming
VOIP used by criminals.

75
00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.940
This is a very interesting fact,
I thought, cuz VOIP for

76
00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.330
gaming is huge, right?

77
00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.050
And criminals have tapped into
this market and are suspected

78
00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:01.100
of conducting criminal activities under
the disguise of VoIP used for gaming.

79
00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:06.250
So oftentimes, in todays gaming world
there's live chat happening between

80
00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.890
player to play and so if one person is
calling another person, that phone call

81
00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.920
could be tapped and most likely will be
tapped if those people are suspected.

82
00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.590
However, in the gaming world
there's millions Millions and

83
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:18.800
billions of people playing that game.

84
00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:23.640
So, what happens is, when you're talking
to someone on the chat it's much more

85
00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:28.650
difficult to track who's chatting what to
some other player when there's a billion

86
00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.120
players all on the same interface there.

87
00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.830
>> And then finally,
anyone can start their own VoIP servers.

88
00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.450
That means, you, me.

89
00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:42.210
So long as you're an experienced coder,
as long as you know how VoIP works.

90
00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:47.260
And in this course we plan to help you

91
00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.730
learn how to use VoIP so you can set it
up on your own using the dragon board.

92
00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:52.620
Right?

93
00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.180
So-
>> Stay tuned for that.

94
00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.780
>> Yeah,
what are some cool things we can do?

95
00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.270
>> Oh, let's see,
one cool thing that I thought

96
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:02.500
>> Let's say you're a new parent, and

97
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.510
you have a child.

98
00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:04.890
And you wanna monitor the child,

99
00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:07.030
make sure it's being safe when
you're at work or something.

100
00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:08.270
>> Right.
>> You can have like a little baby

101
00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.460
monitor, or maybe a video cam that's
always keeping an eye on the child.

102
00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:12.440
>> Huh.
>> And you can use that, and

103
00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.715
you can see a live feed on your cell
>> Phone and that can be done off of VOIP.

104
00:05:15.715 --> 00:05:17.835
>> Yeah that'd be pretty cool.

105
00:05:17.835 --> 00:05:18.725
Be able to program it.

106
00:05:18.725 --> 00:05:21.755
You can say maybe some

107
00:05:21.755 --> 00:05:26.605
kind of voice activate through
your phone or something like that.

108
00:05:26.605 --> 00:05:29.265
>> Yeah.
>> Maybe you have a sensor in your house.

109
00:05:29.265 --> 00:05:31.640
Someone breaks in and
that instantly sends you a phone call.

110
00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:32.270
Right.
>> Pretty neat.

111
00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:33.180
That'll be pretty helpful.

112
00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.770
>> So, the possibilities with what you
can do with VOIP are quite endless and

113
00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.230
we'll try to open up to some of these
ideas later on in this course and

114
00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.860
hope you stay tuned.
