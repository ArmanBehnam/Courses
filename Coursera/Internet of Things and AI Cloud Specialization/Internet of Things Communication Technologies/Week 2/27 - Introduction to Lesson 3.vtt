Welcome to the last lesson
of this module where we will

2
00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:08.485
kinda take a closer look at SIP and
how it relates to VOIP.

3
00:00:08.485 --> 00:00:09.470
>> Mm-hm.

4
00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:10.060
>> All right.

5
00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:11.300
So, what do we got here?

6
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.150
>> So, first we'll talk about what SIP is,
why do we need SIP,

7
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.960
what's it used for, things like that.

8
00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.530
>> Yeah and
just kind of a general overlook, right?

9
00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:19.500
>> Yeah, a general overview, yeah.

10
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.160
>> Yeah, great.

11
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.970
And then we're gonna kind of look
at the protocol operations so

12
00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:26.920
the SIP protocol operations.

13
00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:27.510
>> Right.

14
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.800
>> We're gonna talk about
some of the network elements,

15
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.800
kind of that SIP is built around.

16
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.160
Yeah.
>> Yeah then finally

17
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.130
we're gonna talk about
the SIP messages which are.

18
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.860
>> Yeah so basically how SIP is used
to send and receive information or

19
00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.840
communicate within,
I guess the system itself.

20
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.130
So.

21
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:48.070
We'll get into that.

22
00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.960
A lot of this stuff is fully
available to you online.

23
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.910
You could use a lot of these
keywords to search around and

24
00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:56.500
get all the stuff that
we're gonna be showing you.

25
00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.480
We're gonna look at it very high level,
but if you have some extra time and

26
00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.190
you like to stick around,
feel free to check all these videos out.

27
00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:05.430
Cuz it's still gonna be fun, all right?

28
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.990
Yeah, so we'll see you in the next video.
