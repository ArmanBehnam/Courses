1
00:00:02.472 --> 00:00:06.599
Session initiation protocol, SIP, right?

2
00:00:06.599 --> 00:00:07.611
>> Sipping a drink, right?

3
00:00:07.611 --> 00:00:10.013
>> [LAUGH] Like Sips,
the vegan restaurant.

4
00:00:10.013 --> 00:00:11.836
>> [LAUGH]
>> Over on.

5
00:00:11.836 --> 00:00:16.585
No.
>> No, SIP, Session Initiation Protocol.

6
00:00:16.585 --> 00:00:21.295
So the protocol that's used that initiates
the sessions between media exchange or

7
00:00:21.295 --> 00:00:23.915
data exchange for voice and video, right?

8
00:00:23.915 --> 00:00:26.255
>> Yeah, on the next slide you'll
see that we define it with the.

9
00:00:26.255 --> 00:00:27.735
>> Oh, right here, cool.

10
00:00:27.735 --> 00:00:30.165
>> So it's just a communications
protocol for signaling and

11
00:00:30.165 --> 00:00:33.585
controlling multimedia
communication sessions.

12
00:00:33.585 --> 00:00:40.264
So, basically it's
the overarching rules or system.

13
00:00:40.264 --> 00:00:44.005
How one would do a video call or
an audio call.

14
00:00:44.005 --> 00:00:46.392
>> Yeah, so kind of like how you
have the Internet protocols,

15
00:00:46.392 --> 00:00:48.705
well SIP works on top of
the Internet protocols, right?

16
00:00:48.705 --> 00:00:54.156
>> Yeah, the Internet would be really
broad, like experience everything, and SIP

17
00:00:54.156 --> 00:00:59.449
would talk about like your data packets
would be more specifically referring to

18
00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:04.900
some kind of audio message or video, live
video feedback or something like that.

19
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.544
So here we just want to talk about
the basic SIP message format.

20
00:01:08.544 --> 00:01:12.560
So we have the request line,
or the SIP request line.

21
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.149
So it has a method which is like
the message, what's it trying to tell you,

22
00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:21.433
what's it trying send to the receiver, and

23
00:01:21.433 --> 00:01:27.493
then we have the Request URL is who's
actually gonna get the message basically.

24
00:01:27.493 --> 00:01:31.484
And then finally we have the Version
which is the version of operation to

25
00:01:31.484 --> 00:01:32.688
send the SIP around.

26
00:01:32.688 --> 00:01:33.840
>> Great, do we got any more here?

27
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.140
>> No.

28
00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.599
>> All right, so yeah that's kind
of just a basic overview of SIP.

29
00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.430
I'd recommend searching session
initiation protocol online

30
00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.350
if you wanna know anything more.

31
00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.205
We will be,
this whole lesson's pretty much about SIP.

32
00:01:50.205 --> 00:01:50.762
>> Yeah.

33
00:01:50.762 --> 00:01:52.683
>> So we're gonna be talking
to you a lot more about it and

34
00:01:52.683 --> 00:01:55.587
you'll get a little more in tune with it
but yeah, feel free to pause the video and

35
00:01:55.587 --> 00:01:56.846
go make some searches of your own.

36
00:01:56.846 --> 00:01:58.865
Get a little more in tune with it.

37
00:01:58.865 --> 00:01:59.680
See you in the next video.
