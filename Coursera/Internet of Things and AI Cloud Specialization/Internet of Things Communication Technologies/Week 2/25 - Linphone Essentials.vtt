00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.400
Now, since we're on the Linphone topic
we kinda wanted to go over some of

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.070
the essential, I guess, features on
the Linphone application, high-level.

3
00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.580
>> Now, that you've finished
setting up the app, downloading it,

4
00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:13.590
registering your account.

5
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.882
Let's just check all the essentials,
the settings, everything.

6
00:00:16.882 --> 00:00:19.740
>> So this the application level,
highest level,

7
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.629
where you're interacting
with the application at.

8
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.020
Now, we have some screenshots
up there that you can see.

9
00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.480
These are screenshots of
the Android version or

10
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.560
the iOS version, so they're very similar,
they're gonna look very, very similar.

11
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:34.680
>> Yeah, they're identical.

12
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.810
>> Yeah, and now the image on the left
is the top, I guess, half where you

13
00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:43.361
see kinda your SIP account information and
then you scroll down the screen and

14
00:00:43.361 --> 00:00:46.601
you get the bottom half which
is kind of your settings.

15
00:00:46.601 --> 00:00:47.402
Right?

16
00:00:47.402 --> 00:00:52.020
So, yeah, some of the main things you
wanna kinda look at here and this is

17
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.600
a short video, but your SIP account,
make sure you created your SIP account.

18
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.040
This is your identity,
your domain, so to say.

19
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.560
You wanna make sure that you're
choosing the right audio codecs.

20
00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.920
For instance, what you're planning on
calling, I know that there's different

21
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.410
codecs for that, or
what your phone is capable of handling.

22
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:18.519
Video codes if you're planning on using
video chat or something like that.

23
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.200
Then you have your call options,

24
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:29.040
which I guess just essentially,
what is it?

25
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.921
Decides your prefix, suboptions, etc.

26
00:01:33.921 --> 00:01:36.490
And network, your server, your port.

27
00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.776
And we're gonna go over this again in SIP.

28
00:01:38.776 --> 00:01:44.224
But most SIP ports, or most SIP is used

29
00:01:44.224 --> 00:01:49.001
on ports 5060 and 5061.

30
00:01:49.001 --> 00:01:50.784
And again,
we're going to talk about this more,

31
00:01:50.784 --> 00:01:53.660
it just depends on whether you
want encrypted information or not.

32
00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.699
And then, an advanced button
there that you can go into,

33
00:01:57.699 --> 00:02:02.424
mess with debugging and
stuff like that with your server options.

34
00:02:02.424 --> 00:02:08.640
But yeah, so, anyways, very high level
view of your Linphone application.

35
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.330
And, I'm pretty sure you could just get
all this information by downloading it and

36
00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.930
playing with it.

37
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.334
So, that's what we would recommend.

38
00:02:14.334 --> 00:02:17.850
Instead of just looking at it here on
the slides and listening to us talk.

39
00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.570
Download Linphone on your Android,
on your DragonBoard, on your iPhone,

40
00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.310
wherever you got right now
that you can work with.

41
00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.060
And just check it out and play with it.

42
00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.130
So, we'll see you in the next video.
