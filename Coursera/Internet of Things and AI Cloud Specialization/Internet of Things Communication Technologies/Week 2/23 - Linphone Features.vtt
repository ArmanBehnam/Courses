00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:05.390
As a added bonus, we are going
to go over some of the Linphone

2
00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:10.300
features that we found most interesting or
at least most understandable.

3
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:15.910
>> So, probably what you could take away
from Linphone and add to your own app.

4
00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.790
We also supply the entire list
of features that Linphone has.

5
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:22.664
You guys can just check out the slides or-
>> Yeah, and

6
00:00:22.664 --> 00:00:24.022
you can get this off their website.

7
00:00:24.022 --> 00:00:25.902
We just wanted to provide it for you here.

8
00:00:25.902 --> 00:00:27.979
But some cool little things,

9
00:00:27.979 --> 00:00:32.974
some obvious things that would be
sought after for a VoIP application.

10
00:00:32.974 --> 00:00:37.233
Audio at the very least, but audio and
video calls, you might wanna be able to

11
00:00:37.233 --> 00:00:41.436
manage multiple calls like for instance-
>> Telecon, something like that.

12
00:00:41.436 --> 00:00:44.698
>> Yeah, If I'm on the phone with
Randy and someone else calls me

13
00:00:44.698 --> 00:00:46.244
>> [CROSSTALK] Maybe like holds and

14
00:00:46.244 --> 00:00:47.439
everything like that.

15
00:00:47.439 --> 00:00:49.951
>> Then you go bring in the call
transfers, pause, resume,

16
00:00:49.951 --> 00:00:51.860
audio conferencing, instant messaging.

17
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.216
Maybe you just wanna say like hey,
call me when you're free.

18
00:00:55.216 --> 00:00:58.540
So, I send that message and
then done, right?

19
00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:05.230
File transfers,
picture taking, all sorts of,

20
00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:10.370
call history, things that we take for
granted on our phones nowadays.

21
00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.260
There's a lot of code behind it,
and it's all there, too.

22
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.220
>> Right.

23
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.630
>> What's next here?

24
00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.530
So, different languages,
spoken languages, right?

25
00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.070
I know that Linphone has various
languages available, as in,

26
00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:29.970
I think you can get it in Japanese,
Chinese, Dutch or something like that.

27
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.190
There's a lot of different
languages that you can get it in.

28
00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:35.550
So, all that's access.

29
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.580
Quality of service.

30
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:44.450
Different aspects of the code that
provide a different quality of service.

31
00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.957
And then more advanced features like
the audio codecs and the video codecs.

32
00:01:47.957 --> 00:01:50.233
>> As mentioned before, and
we'll probably mention it again and again.

33
00:01:50.233 --> 00:01:52.190
>> HD video support.

34
00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.480
Say, for instance, you're functioning
on a low bandwidth network,

35
00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.350
you can switch it to low bandwidth mode.

36
00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.360
Fighting push notifications for

37
00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.360
the mobile device platforms;
these are all cool things.

38
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.970
But yeah.

39
00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.130
Okay.
So, we went over all these features and

40
00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.800
there's plenty more on the website but
which ones do we wanna keep for

41
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.260
our application, right?

42
00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.150
>> That's a tough question, right?

43
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.055
>> So, here's the question,
to keep or not to keep.

44
00:02:17.055 --> 00:02:20.073
>> [LAUGH]
>> We are developing an application from

45
00:02:20.073 --> 00:02:21.027
scratch, right?

46
00:02:21.027 --> 00:02:23.830
>> Right.
>> Using the Android tutorials online?

47
00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.305
>> So, we'll basically be going
over how to make the audio calls.

48
00:02:28.305 --> 00:02:29.340
Mm-hm.

49
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.210
>> But,
with Linphone you'll have a resource to

50
00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:33.940
implement a ton of other things as well.

51
00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.410
>> Yeah.
So, we're gonna go over the basics.

52
00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.430
This is obviously modules from now.

53
00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.532
But, we're gonna go over the basics
on bringing all this code together,

54
00:02:41.532 --> 00:02:44.180
creating something very
simple to make an audio

55
00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.900
call-
>> Right.

56
00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.600
>> from Android devices,
your DragonBoard 410c,

57
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.412
in particular
>> To either another Android device or

58
00:02:50.412 --> 00:02:51.412
another DragonBoard.

59
00:02:51.412 --> 00:02:52.155
>> Yeah.
>> Right?

60
00:02:52.155 --> 00:02:53.270
Not using Linphone.

61
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.090
This is our own application.

62
00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.986
And then you can take the Linphone stuff
and, look, these are some of the ideas we

63
00:02:58.986 --> 00:03:03.081
thought would be interesting to just make
a nice core bare-bone VoIP application.

64
00:03:03.081 --> 00:03:06.330
>> Right.
>> Without all the other noise.

65
00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.920
>> Right.

66
00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.380
You can just make something real basic
using these six little bullet points here.

67
00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:11.210
Try adding those.

68
00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:12.280
Maybe it'll be an assignment.

69
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.285
>> Yeah, that'd be cool.

70
00:03:13.285 --> 00:03:14.910
>> [LAUGH]
>> It'll be a fun little project for

71
00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:15.910
you to tackle on.

72
00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.570
>> Yeah.
>> Like a personal VoIP app.

73
00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.810
>> You can share it with your family and
friends.

74
00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:21.570
And it'll be your own.

75
00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:22.880
Yeah actually that's pretty cool.

76
00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.090
>> Your own network.

77
00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.010
No one can invade it and whatnot.

78
00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.215
Awesome.
>> No spam calls.

79
00:03:27.215 --> 00:03:28.830
>> [LAUGH] Yeah.

80
00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.778
All right, so there you go.

81
00:03:30.778 --> 00:03:32.940
That was Linphone features,

82
00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.460
and we hope you enjoyed some of
the stuff we chose for our app.
