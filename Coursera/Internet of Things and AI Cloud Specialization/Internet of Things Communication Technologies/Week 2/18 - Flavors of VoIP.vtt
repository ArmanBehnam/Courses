00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:06.040
So now that you know what VoIP is,
let's check out some main flavors of VoIP,

2
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.450
starting with the ATA, or
the analog telephone adapter,

3
00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.770
and that's just the most simplest and
most common form of VoIP and

4
00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:20.300
it's just a little box that you can use
for your, to connect your phone into and

5
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.700
you have VoIP calling instead
of a traditional landline.

6
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:23.600
How does it do it?

7
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:29.380
It just, an ATA is just a ADC, which
stands for analog to digital converter,

8
00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:35.040
so it will take the analog signal that
comes from the phone, convert it to

9
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.320
a digital signal, and then send it through
the Internet for someone else to receive.

10
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.210
ATAs are normally bundled
by service providers, so

11
00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.990
instead of the service provider
giving you the normal landline,

12
00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:54.365
kind of traditional phone service, you now
have web calling capabilities instead.

13
00:00:54.365 --> 00:00:56.090
>> Mm-hm.

14
00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.250
>> Next we have the IP phones.

15
00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.770
>> Right.
>> And so IP phones is

16
00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.830
just very similar to a landline
phone with an ATA built into it.

17
00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.300
>> Yeah, it's just an ATA built into it,
so it looks like a normal phone, but

18
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.390
instead of traditional
phone calls you have

19
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.250
Internet protocol phone or
VoIP phone calls.

20
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.920
>> And so IP phones, so most of the phones
that exist today, most smartphones all

21
00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.850
have IP phone capabilities, so whenever
your smartphone's connected on wi-fi or

22
00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.400
on an additional network, you basically,
your phone is basically an IP Phone.

23
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.270
And what that means is that the hardware
and the software to make WiFi calls or

24
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.800
VoIP calls, any of those things,
they're already built into the phone,

25
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.580
you don't need any external software, you
don't need to get any external hardware.

26
00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:44.320
Everything's built in.

27
00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.850
>> You know what else makes for
really good VoIP IP phone?

28
00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:50.440
>> What?

29
00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:51.320
>> The Dragonboard.

30
00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.640
>> Right!
>> Would you believe that?

31
00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:53.630
>> Completely forgot about that.

32
00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.819
So, you guys have been watching three
courses on the Dragonboard so far, and

33
00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:02.210
the Dragonboard is essentially an IP phone
and it has all the WiFi capabilities.

34
00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.570
It has the hardware built into it,
and it has the soft, and bring you,

35
00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.170
as soon as you get the operating system,
you also have the software built into it.

36
00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.860
>> Right.
You just set up the software and

37
00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.875
you can just call anyone
with the Internet.

38
00:02:13.875 --> 00:02:16.960
>> Yeah, and we're gonna be teaching you
how to do all those things later on in

39
00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:17.500
the course, too.

40
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.860
>> And
finally we have the computer computer.

41
00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:21.400
>> Right.

42
00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.959
>> So the computer computer calling is
the easiest way to use VoIP in most cases,

43
00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.340
and in almost all the cases I
can think of is usually free.

44
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.370
>> [LAUGH]
>> For instance if you have Skype.

45
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.310
If you have Skype and the person
you're trying to call also has Skype,

46
00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.280
even if they're in some other part
of the world in a different country,

47
00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.250
Skype call is 99% of the time it's free,
and you can talk for as long as you want.

48
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.550
You have video call and audio call and
you don't need any external hardware or

49
00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:46.170
software.

50
00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.100
An external hardware, like computer
computer, it's pure software.

51
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.870
>> Yeah.
>> So, you have to download the software.

52
00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.390
As long as you have the software,
it's a pure software business thing, so

53
00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:56.180
it can take care of that.

54
00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.560
>> Yeah, it'll be very good as long as
set up to like a microphone, speakers.

55
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.400
>> Right, so you need a webcam and
all those things, and

56
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.660
the only charge that comes with the
computer computer calling is that you have

57
00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.350
the monthly Internet charge that you have
to pay anyway if you're using Internet.

58
00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.517
Other than that it's probably
the easiest way to use VoIP, and

59
00:03:13.517 --> 00:03:15.689
with that we'll see you in our next video.
