00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:07.640
So, we wanna take a minute or two to
kinda go over the protocol operations or

2
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.960
the general operations of the SIP.

3
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.130
Let's take a look here.

4
00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:17.010
Now, what does a SIP do?

5
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:17.940
What is this protocol?

6
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.440
What are the operations of this protocol?

7
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:26.176
Now, in general, it's basically like
Randy said in the previous video or

8
00:00:26.176 --> 00:00:31.455
one of the videos before that,
it's in charge of the interlinking or

9
00:00:31.455 --> 00:00:33.838
the session that takes place.

10
00:00:33.838 --> 00:00:37.980
>> Basically like the guy
that makes all the rules for

11
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.534
how do you send the video or
audio message.

12
00:00:41.534 --> 00:00:47.530
>> Yeah, and you know, over different
settings you can have multiparty.

13
00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.416
But, you know, definitely need two people.

14
00:00:49.416 --> 00:00:50.048
>> Right.
[LAUGH]

15
00:00:50.048 --> 00:00:51.253
>> As a standard procedure at least two.

16
00:00:51.253 --> 00:00:54.470
So, two or multiple people.

17
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:59.394
[COUGH] Now,
the SIP was built very similar,

18
00:00:59.394 --> 00:01:03.650
if not almost identical to HTTP.

19
00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.430
So, a lot of the request respond

20
00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.340
situations that you're gonna experience
in HTTP, kind of like what we did in

21
00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.320
course two where we built
the Dragonboard monitor and

22
00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.350
course three where we kind of had
a communicate and send stuff to the GPIOs.

23
00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.420
>> Right.
>> A lot of that formatting is gonna

24
00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.480
be very similar because it's built on the
same kinda language or the same script.

25
00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.660
Now, you can kinda see on the slides
there, if you want to take a look, just

26
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:38.800
a few other kinda things that we found
interesting about the protocol operations.

27
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.820
But yeah, so
you have the SIP network resources

28
00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.240
are identified using a URI,
which is a Uniform Resource Identifier.

29
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.613
This is your kind of identification.

30
00:01:50.613 --> 00:01:51.228
>> Right.

31
00:01:51.228 --> 00:01:51.913
>> Right.

32
00:01:51.913 --> 00:01:53.090
>> So, it's like your address.

33
00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.160
>> Your address.

34
00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.130
>> It's like,
regular phones you have a phone number.

35
00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.920
But for these SIP phones, or the SIP VoIP
applications, you have a SIP URI.

36
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.671
>> Yeah, so I know like for, what is it,
for when we made our Linphone,

37
00:02:05.671 --> 00:02:07.631
when we registered with Linphone.

38
00:02:07.631 --> 00:02:12.111
We made our account, and for instance,
say, we called it Dragonboard.

39
00:02:12.111 --> 00:02:20.947
So, our account would be
sip:dragonboard@sip.linphone.org.

40
00:02:20.947 --> 00:02:26.000
So, that's your URI, basically your URI.

41
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.939
Oh, actually it's up there, sip:username.

42
00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:30.619
[LAUGH]
>> In the slide, all right, cool.

43
00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:34.388
Yeah, so anyways, and
in some cases it's a password,

44
00:02:34.388 --> 00:02:38.060
in some cases not but yeah,
so protocol operations.

45
00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.498
And looking more into the protocol
operations, as you can see,

46
00:02:42.498 --> 00:02:47.350
[COUGH] it's basically involved in
the signaling portion of communications.

47
00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:55.452
So, it is gonna be what kind of pings
out the signals, the data and such.

48
00:02:55.452 --> 00:03:00.816
We mentioned in a previous lesson that
SIP functions on two ports mainly,

49
00:03:00.816 --> 00:03:02.730
and we have them up there.

50
00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:09.071
It's port 5060, which is used for
non-encrypted signaling traffic and

51
00:03:09.071 --> 00:03:15.080
then you have port 5061, which is for
traffic that's encrypted.

52
00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.429
Now, if you're ever connected onto
your Wi-Fi, or the Internet, and

53
00:03:19.429 --> 00:03:24.154
you have an option to choose your security
setting, and you have it set to TLS.

54
00:03:24.154 --> 00:03:29.059
Now, if you're running
your VoIP program on

55
00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:33.964
port 5060, but you're on a TLS Wi-Fi or

56
00:03:33.964 --> 00:03:39.142
network, then you might
run into some issues.

57
00:03:39.142 --> 00:03:39.722
>> Right.

58
00:03:39.722 --> 00:03:45.700
>> That's something to think about
when deciding what port to use, right?

59
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.929
So, there's really only two to choose
from and yeah, so there you go.

60
00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:56.500
Anyways, these are the protocol
operations that we wanted to go through.

61
00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.710
We hope that it helped you out just
a little bit to get more in tuned with

62
00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:03.040
SIP and its kind of underlying operations.

63
00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.220
>> And how it works with VoIP and
everything like that.

64
00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.569
>> Yeah, so we'll go into a little bit
more in the next video, so stay tuned.
