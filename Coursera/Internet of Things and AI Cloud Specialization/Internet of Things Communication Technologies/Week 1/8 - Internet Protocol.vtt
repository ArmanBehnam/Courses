00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:05.690
In this video we're going to go a little
bit more in depth about the Internet

2
00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:10.220
protocol and kind of talk to you
about packets or data grams.

3
00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.920
Same thing.

4
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.100
>> Right.

5
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.730
>> So, let's take a look at kind
of what the Internet protocol is.

6
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.390
Now, a lot of this information up
there is just pulled from Wikipedia.

7
00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.640
Feel free to go search Internet
protocol in your search engine and

8
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.190
go to the Wikipedia page.

9
00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.290
You'll find a lot of this stuff up there,

10
00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:29.790
this is kind of just
a condensed form of it.

11
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:33.130
But yeah, so if you want to
take a look at the screen here,

12
00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.210
you can see just kind of the basic
points of what Internet protocol is.

13
00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:37.930
And what is it?

14
00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:43.140
Well, it's the principal communications
protocol for the Internet Protocol Suite.

15
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.850
And there's that terminology.

16
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.300
>> Right, that we mentioned before.

17
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.970
>> You remember, it's the same thing.

18
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.790
We're just saying that-
>> It's a way for

19
00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:54.940
computers just to talk to each other.

20
00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.300
>> Yeah, that being said, the Internet
protocol is kind of what's used,

21
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.210
like he said, to take a computer,
a device, right?

22
00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.190
That's hooked into a network and
then have that device or

23
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.440
that network hooked into other networks.

24
00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.370
So that's kinda basically
what the Internet is.

25
00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.320
It is just a bunch of networks connected
to each other working over this

26
00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.770
Internet protocol, right?

27
00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.060
So I think that's how it first started.

28
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.580
>> Yeah, it's just a way to standardize
all the messages and sending,

29
00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.600
receiving, cuz if you have
different ways to encode it,

30
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.320
it would be very difficult
to understand everything.

31
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.720
>> Yeah, it's universal, right?

32
00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.220
They had to come up with version for
this, but this is how it started.

33
00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.090
You call I think a single network,
the intranet, right?

34
00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.490
So you could have a university that
functions on their own intranet, and

35
00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.480
that's a private version of the Internet
and then they take their network and

36
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.810
they hook it up to the Internet
where all these other intranets or

37
00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.790
networks are hooked into and you get,
and they're all working under the same

38
00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.430
protocol basically to send and
receive their packets of information.

39
00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.760
>> Right. Right. And
then you get a giant web of everything.

40
00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:57.340
>> Yeah.

41
00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.020
So we're gonna be working with
the same protocol using our

42
00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.569
VoIP-
>> Right.

43
00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:01.610
>> Software.
>> [LAUGH]

44
00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:02.370
>> Right.

45
00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.318
>> Or our void per application.

46
00:02:04.318 --> 00:02:05.033
>> Right.

47
00:02:05.033 --> 00:02:09.220
Great, so as you can see there, we talked
about this in the last lesson, but

48
00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.760
right now you have two different versions
to choose from for the Internet protocols.

49
00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:19.282
You have IVP or IPv4 and IPv6,
what happened to one, two, three and five?

50
00:02:19.282 --> 00:02:20.800
>> [LAUGH]
>> Who knows.

51
00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.930
>> Who knows, yeah.
No, this is the most prominent one so

52
00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:29.400
you'll basically see those floating
around these modules and on the Internet.

53
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.171
All right so, the datagram
construction kinda talking a little

54
00:02:34.171 --> 00:02:38.778
bit more in depth about Internet
protocol or packet, right?

55
00:02:38.778 --> 00:02:43.176
You can see on I guess the second
level from the bottom,

56
00:02:43.176 --> 00:02:45.780
you have IP header and IP data.

57
00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.400
So I'm gonna kinda shrink this.

58
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.871
We're gonna talk a little
bit more about it.

59
00:02:49.871 --> 00:02:55.990
IP header and IP data, every packet or
datagram has a header and

60
00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:02.605
a payload, so essentially a header
telling it where it needs to go.

61
00:03:02.605 --> 00:03:06.930
[COUGH] And then a payload which is data,
information it wants to send.

62
00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.460
Going a little bit more in depth on
this particular packet as a whole, if

63
00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:16.170
you look at the very top the application
side, well this is the application layer,

64
00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.120
this is where kind of,
the interaction is happening, so to say.

65
00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.070
Then you have the transport layer where
it gets all of this stuff ready to

66
00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.468
be transported,
ends up at the IP layer and,

67
00:03:29.468 --> 00:03:32.880
or the Internet layer where
it sets the addresses,

68
00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.600
gets it all rounded up and throws it out,
and then the hardware level.

69
00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.510
So that would be the link
to the hardware level.

70
00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.940
There's not much more to
really go into this, but

71
00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.560
I mean this is a very
high level explanation.

72
00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.430
There's a lot more to do
with the Internet protocol.

73
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.160
We will run into it
again I think later on,

74
00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.190
module four or something
>> Right.

75
00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.500
Huh.
>> When we start to build the application.

76
00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.400
But until then,
it should be enough, otherwise feel

77
00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.450
free to go search the Internet and-
>> Look up-

78
00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:07.240
>> Internet protocol.

79
00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.400
Yeah, internet protocol.

80
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.060
>> Diagrams.

81
00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.100
>> Yeah, have some fun with it.

82
00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.350
It's definitely a lot of
information to absorb.

83
00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:13.580
But there you go.

84
00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.410
We'll see you in the next video.

85
00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:16.256
And yeah.
