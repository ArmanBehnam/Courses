00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.520
Welcome to your favorite
part of every single lesson,

2
00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.770
where we go over what we went over-
>> Right.

3
00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:07.640
>> at the end.

4
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:13.670
Yeah, so we started by gong over PSTN,
which is public switch telephone networks.

5
00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.080
We related it to the packet
switch telephone networks.

6
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.470
Kind of Jobbed around it
about VOIP a little bit.

7
00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:21.560
>> How VOIP connects to it.

8
00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.580
>> How VOIP connects to it and kinda yeah.

9
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.250
Kinda explained a little bit about that,
it was fun.

10
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.140
>> Afterwards we talked about a big
open VOIP or open-source VOIP software

11
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.300
called Linphone and
we showed you how to get the source code.

12
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.700
Maybe you will try to take
a look at all the code and

13
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:38.970
how they interact with each other.

14
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.830
>> Yeah, it'll be good cuz we're actually
gonna walk you through a little bit of

15
00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:43.290
Linphone stuff in the next module.

16
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.590
So, you'll get to kinda
see some of that and

17
00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.170
maybe you take some time
to explore the source code.

18
00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.170
You'll [SOUND] maybe get a little bit-
>> Yeah.

19
00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.390
Exactly.
>> More familiar with it by

20
00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:53.910
the time you see it.

21
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.350
And then codec selection.

22
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.660
>> Right, so.
>> Ren did a great job.

23
00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:57.200
>> Yeah, finally.

24
00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.230
And then Leslie, we went over more
in-depth explanation of codecs.

25
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.670
Then we talked about what kind of
codecs you might think of using.

26
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.210
Codec selection is usually up to the user.

27
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.580
Sometimes it's automated by what
kind of container you use or

28
00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:14.990
whatever software you're using.

29
00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.850
>> Great, so that mean's that
that's the end of this lesson and

30
00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.200
actually the end of this module.

31
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.560
>> Right.
>> So,

32
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.030
make sure you get your cheat sheets ready.

33
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.210
Because I'm pretty sure
there's gonna video challenge.

34
00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:29.850
Or if anything a little peer.

35
00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.460
View assignment.

36
00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.580
Coming up for you after your quiz.

37
00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.060
Have fun with the rest of the modules and

38
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.260
we look forward to building this
application with you later in the course.

39
00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:42.030
So yeah, have fun.

40
00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.320
We'll see you in the next module.
