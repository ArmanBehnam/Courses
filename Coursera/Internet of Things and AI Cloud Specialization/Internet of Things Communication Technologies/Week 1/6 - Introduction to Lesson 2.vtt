00:00:02.589 --> 00:00:03.929
Greetings everyone,

2
00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.863
here in this lesson we'll be doing what
we've done previously, and that's going

3
00:00:08.863 --> 00:00:13.810
over some concepts that we found that will
help you understand this course better.

4
00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.760
>> All right, so
kind of up on the screen there.

5
00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.870
You can kinda see we're gonna
start by talking to you about

6
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:22.980
the software stack, or,

7
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.715
if software stack giving you a little bit-
>> Huh,

8
00:00:24.715 --> 00:00:26.336
giving you a little bit
of a broad overview.

9
00:00:26.336 --> 00:00:27.647
What it is, you know,

10
00:00:27.647 --> 00:00:32.221
give you, and some examples how you can
see it on your own life, own projects.

11
00:00:32.221 --> 00:00:35.472
>> Yeah, and then as promised last,
in the last lesson,

12
00:00:35.472 --> 00:00:40.500
with all those terminologies and acronyms,
you're gonna see Internet Protocol.

13
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.600
We're gonna go a little bit more
in depth on what that is and

14
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.280
how you're gonna use it, I guess,
kinda how you're gonna use it.

15
00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.777
And then the packet switch network
which essentially is what evolved from

16
00:00:49.777 --> 00:00:51.601
the circuit switch network.

17
00:00:51.601 --> 00:00:55.838
So, essentially the Internet,
right, the packet switch network.

18
00:00:55.838 --> 00:00:59.108
So, we'll kind of talk a little bit
about that and how it's set up.

19
00:00:59.108 --> 00:01:00.610
But yeah, stay tuned.

20
00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:01.610
>> Mm-hm.

21
00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.280
>> Get you going on the next videos,
and we'll see you then.
