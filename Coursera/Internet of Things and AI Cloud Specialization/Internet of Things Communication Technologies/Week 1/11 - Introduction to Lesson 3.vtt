00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.150
Welcome to lesson three,
Supplemental Material, kind of a rinse,

2
00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:06.600
repeat for the last.

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.460
>> Last couple of modules, right.

4
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:09.460
>> Last course.

5
00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:10.275
>> Oh, yeah, courses.

6
00:00:10.275 --> 00:00:11.460
>> [LAUGH]
>> So, it's alright.

7
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.370
Anyways, so what are we gonna cover?

8
00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:15.070
>> And so, we'll go ahead and

9
00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.740
start this course off talking
about the traditional phone.

10
00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.520
Because that is basically
the precursor to what we're gonna talk

11
00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:23.440
about right now, which is VoIP.

12
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:23.980
Right?
>> Yeah.

13
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.580
Essentially, we're talking the traditional
phone, and we're trying to adapt it to

14
00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.540
this new type of technology,
Voice Over Internet Protocol.

15
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.510
But people still use traditional phones.

16
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.360
>> So, how do we call a traditional
phone from a VoIP program, and so,

17
00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.420
it's kind of perspective.

18
00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.920
>> From a VoIP program or
a IP phone, right.?

19
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.720
So yeah, kinda want to talk to
you a little about the public.

20
00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.230
PSTN stands for
Public Switch Telephone Network.

21
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.670
That was in the acronyms.

22
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.465
>> Yeah,
hopefully it's on your cheatsheet as well.

23
00:00:52.465 --> 00:00:53.890
>> [LAUGH]
>> And then,

24
00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.010
we're gonna go over a particular
VoIP application called Linphone.

25
00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.260
And we'll talk about this,

26
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.620
a little more in the next module, but
we wanna kind of tell you where and

27
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:10.140
how to access the source code for
Linphone, since it is an open source VoIP.

28
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.855
Program.

29
00:01:10.855 --> 00:01:15.500
>> Mm-hm.
>> For Ubuntu, Mac, Windows, Android, iOS,

30
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.970
they pretty much have it all over.

31
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.190
>> Yeah.
So, you basically like adapt,

32
00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.270
say your own kind of a web application
with the help of Linphone.

33
00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:24.400
>> Yeah, and if you're skilled enough,

34
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.190
we're not gonna do this particularly,
we're gonna build our own on Android.

35
00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.240
But if you're skilled enough,
you can go in there.

36
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.750
You can take a lot of this source code.

37
00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.170
And you can apply it to what we're doing,
and make our application better, and

38
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.840
better, and better.

39
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.600
>> Or even maybe, make Linphone better.

40
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:39.110
>> Yeah.
>> And

41
00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.340
you can tell them, give them an email.

42
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.160
>> Make Linphone better, yeah.

43
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.280
Participate on their forums and
their community or

44
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.760
just make your own personalized
VoIP app which can be pretty fun.

45
00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:49.690
So, yeah.

46
00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.780
>> And then finally,
we talk about Codecs and Codecs selection.

47
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.910
That's something we mentioned
earlier in the first session.

48
00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.320
So, you know, but that was a very broad
overview, so you know what are codecs,

49
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.400
maybe you still have some questions.

50
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.730
>> Yeah, so
we'll see you in the next videos.
