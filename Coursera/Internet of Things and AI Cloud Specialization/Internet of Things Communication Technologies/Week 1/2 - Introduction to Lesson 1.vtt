00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:02.250
Everyone.

2
00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:03.970
A new day, a new course.

3
00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:06.610
So, you know what we've been doing for
the past few courses.

4
00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:08.960
We will just jump right into module one,
lesson one,

5
00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.510
where we go over some acronyms and
terminology.

6
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:18.060
So, like I just said, we'll first start
by going over acronyms, and then later on

7
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.330
we're going over terminology that'll all
be helpful if you add it to a cheat sheet.

8
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.570
If you review these terms hopefully it'll
make the rest of the course much easier,

9
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.690
much smoother.

10
00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:32.020
You'll be able to understand
things that we might mention but

11
00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.378
we don't define so well.

12
00:00:33.378 --> 00:00:37.120
So, stick around.
