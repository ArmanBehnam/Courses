00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:02.960
Hey, everyone.

2
00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:06.490
So, let's go ahead, and
dive right into talking about the PSTN, or

3
00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:10.970
the public switch telephone networks,
which is just the traditional phone

4
00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:14.760
sorta network, and
how it relates to everything here.

5
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:15.945
>> Yeah, how it relates to VoIP.

6
00:00:15.945 --> 00:00:16.570
>> Mm-hm.

7
00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.950
So, first of all, it's just a circuit
switch network, which basically means it's

8
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:27.740
a network that uses circuits
to connect the nodes to send

9
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:34.300
the data instead of the packet switch
network where it just uses the Internet.

10
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.480
So, that's just.

11
00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.380
So, to get the circuit switch networks,

12
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.130
they would have to setup
the physical telephone lines.

13
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.670
Sometimes you've seen them in movies
where they have the long poles and

14
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.010
just runs across everywhere.

15
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.320
And then, sometimes you'll need
to call someone in Europe,

16
00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.190
you'll have to have an underwater
giant cable, something like that.

17
00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.860
>> And while traditional
analog telephones still exist,

18
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.300
the public switched telephone
network will as well.

19
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.080
Because even when using VoIP,

20
00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.760
the VoIP signal eventually gets to a point
where it needs to find the telephone.

21
00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:18.830
>> Yeah, so all these were just
the traditional landline phones, whatnot.

22
00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:24.090
And since it's had so much time to grow,
which is why the network is just

23
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.700
humongous right now, and that's why it's
probably not gonna go away any time soon.

24
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.494
>> Yeah.
>> So, here we're going look

25
00:01:33.494 --> 00:01:39.080
at over some things about the original
phone where it just has the microphone,

26
00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.230
has the ear piece, or
the speaker which is the receiver.

27
00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.960
You have a ringer so
you know when someone's calling you.

28
00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.100
And you have some contacts or
addresses so you know who to call.

29
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.060
And all of these are also
encapsulated in VoIP.

30
00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.840
Right?

31
00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.646
But, it tends to be less efficient,

32
00:01:55.646 --> 00:02:00.840
because it doesn't really
use the bandwidth that well.

33
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.410
Because everything's just on analog.

34
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.890
>> Yeah, so when it comes to
the old school telephones.

35
00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.820
I don't know, maybe some of you remember
because you still use the old school

36
00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.400
telephones, the analog phones.

37
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:18.440
But you have to have all these other
devices, you have your phone but

38
00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.670
if you want a Caller ID,
you have to hook up a Caller ID.

39
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.820
If you want a message machine,
you have to hook up a message machine.

40
00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.706
All of these things just come integrated-
>> That adds up to have a overhead cost.

41
00:02:29.706 --> 00:02:33.240
So, the old telephones didn't have more,
but

42
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.140
often times with VoIP phones everything's
already integrated, like software, or

43
00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.940
just simply all in one package.

44
00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.790
So, with that begs us to ask the question,

45
00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.510
if VoIP is better then why
is the PSTN still around?

46
00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.230
And we just answered that earlier where
it's humongous because there's been so

47
00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.530
much time for the network to grow.

48
00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.550
Because the analog phones came first,

49
00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.260
Internet was not around until
say two decades ago, right?

50
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.285
>> Yeah, so you have a huge network which
means we still have to cater to that.

51
00:03:05.285 --> 00:03:09.990
>> Right, so we have to find a way, if
we're gonna slowly transition into VoIP,

52
00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.540
we have to find a way to
still be able to talk

53
00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.318
to the old analog phones that
are still on the PSTN network.

54
00:03:16.318 --> 00:03:18.090
>> Mm-hm.
>> Or PSTN.

55
00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.060
And the way they do that, is,
we would introduce a device that will just

56
00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.900
basically convert the signal
that the VoIP uses

57
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.110
into a signal that the traditional
phone can understand.

58
00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.530
And likewise, the traditional phone
will be able to send a signal

59
00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.280
that gets converted into a signal
that VoIP can understand.

60
00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.450
So, with that, and

61
00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.482
here we have up on the slides where you
can see how everything sort of connects.

62
00:03:46.482 --> 00:03:48.690
Where there's the IP and then the PSTN and

63
00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.630
they have to communicate through
this gateway, basically.

64
00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.095
>> Yeah, we're gonna actually talk
about gateways a little bit later.

65
00:03:55.095 --> 00:03:56.400
>> Mm-hm.
Yeah, exactly.

66
00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.740
But, that just wraps up our talk
about the traditional phone,

67
00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:02.560
and we'll see you next time.
