00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:02.730
Welcome back everyone.

2
00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.660
In this section we're gonna just
be talking about Linphone and

3
00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:07.130
its source code.

4
00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:10.620
So let's start off with
what's Linphone and

5
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.383
Linphone is just an open
sourced web software.

6
00:00:15.383 --> 00:00:21.200
So, yeah, open source voice software so
you can simply download it,

7
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.160
use our code, or even download
the source code and take a look at it.

8
00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.050
So in this section, we're gonna
be telling you how to get it, and

9
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.100
if you're really curious about it, you
can just go over the files, check it out.

10
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.670
So we're mainly concerned
about Android and

11
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.460
Ubuntu because that's what
the Dragonboard currently uses.

12
00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.920
>> So Windows 10 eventually.

13
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.190
>> Yeah.
>> I think it's coming out real soon.

14
00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.150
>> Yeah.
So, but since it went to the desktop all

15
00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:51.460
the desktop versions get downloaded all
in one package so that's pretty nice.

16
00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.820
So you usually need to repeat the same
steps for the Windows 10 version.

17
00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:56.990
>> Yeah we wanna just kinda, and

18
00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:01.970
I know we already kinda touched on this,
but this is a more complex section.

19
00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:02.730
>> Right.

20
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.820
And if you if you find that it's
a little too hard to follow,

21
00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.150
you can feel free to skip, right?

22
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:09.790
I think you said that.

23
00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:10.372
>> Mhm, yeah.

24
00:01:10.372 --> 00:01:15.200
>> So yeah, otherwise just go ahead and
download it anyways and

25
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.890
just poke around because I know I've
had fun poking around source code and

26
00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.600
since we are going on
the whole VoIP thing,

27
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.990
maybe you find something you
like that you want to implement.

28
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.100
>> We feel like since this
Linphone server works,

29
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.390
and it works pretty well, it would be
a great resource for you to look at.

30
00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.290
Say you wanna make your own VoIP project.

31
00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.129
>> Yeah.
>> All right, let's get started.

32
00:01:35.129 --> 00:01:40.088
So you need to head to the Linphone
website and go into the Linphone little

33
00:01:40.088 --> 00:01:44.820
tab that they overview, right, and
then go into the Downloads tab.

34
00:01:46.225 --> 00:01:51.505
It's simply for Android, you just need
to open up your Android Studios and

35
00:01:51.505 --> 00:01:56.330
do a checkout from Version Control, which
we've showed you in a previous course.

36
00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.876
>> Course two.

37
00:01:56.876 --> 00:02:02.180
>> Yeah, course two, and you just need to
copy paste the GitHub link as I've, and

38
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.439
I've also given the examples
on these slides.

39
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.900
And if you want to get it for
Ubuntu, you'll need to launch

40
00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.080
the onboard terminal or
even your own terminal, right?

41
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:22.260
And then you can just use copy paste the
band they have right there on the slides.

42
00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.330
I've also given it on the slides.

43
00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.054
>> The git clone,
colon backslash backslash.

44
00:02:27.054 --> 00:02:31.898
>> Yeah.
[LAUGH] Get the Desktop Repository and

45
00:02:31.898 --> 00:02:37.370
that will you give you all
the files you need for

46
00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.150
to take a look at how Linphone works.

47
00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:50.045
And just a little note I believe all
the Ubuntu and Mac files are in C.

48
00:02:50.045 --> 00:02:51.850
>> Yes.
>> And in Windows versions,

49
00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.590
I believe, are in Java.

50
00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:55.490
Oh, no, Android's in Java.

51
00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.700
>> The Android is in Java.

52
00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.050
Ubuntu and Mac is in C, and
I believe Windows as well in C.

53
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.629
>> Okay, there you go.

54
00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:06.268
[CROSSTALK]
>> At least a derivative of C, so maybe a

55
00:03:06.268 --> 00:03:09.212
>> C sharp or C.

56
00:03:09.212 --> 00:03:10.584
>> But this is all on the website, so

57
00:03:10.584 --> 00:03:13.280
we're just kinda trying to remember
what we saw on the website.

58
00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.100
Just feel free to check it out.

59
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.630
>> Right.

60
00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.250
>> Get your source code, poke around,
have some fun with it, and yeah,

61
00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.345
I think that's it, right?

62
00:03:21.345 --> 00:03:23.522
[CROSSTALK]
>> So, with the source code, and

63
00:03:23.522 --> 00:03:25.504
we've mentioned this earlier, too.

64
00:03:25.504 --> 00:03:28.750
So what's the point of downloading this?

65
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.061
And so
we believe that in downloading this,

66
00:03:31.061 --> 00:03:35.433
and maybe you'll poke around, you'll see
what the developers were thinking, so

67
00:03:35.433 --> 00:03:38.255
you have maybe the eyes of
a VoIP software developer.

68
00:03:38.255 --> 00:03:43.317
So it will be a great example for
you to develop your own VoIP app and

69
00:03:43.317 --> 00:03:49.870
we also believe in like, checking out
the source files and how they interact.

70
00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.460
You will see how like, phone calls or
video calls work or text messaging works.

71
00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:57.370
You'll just be able to see how
everything works how the SIP

72
00:03:58.666 --> 00:04:03.090
is enabled how it functions and
the grand scheme of things.

73
00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.725
And with that-
>> And

74
00:04:04.725 --> 00:04:07.390
with that [LAUGH] we'll
see you in the next video.
