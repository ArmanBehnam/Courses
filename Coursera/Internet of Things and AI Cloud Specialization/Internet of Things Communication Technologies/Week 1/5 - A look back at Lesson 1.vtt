00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:06.460
So as always we're gonna go over the,
what we went over in this lesson.

2
00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:09.600
And this is actually a simple one
because all we did was acronyms and

3
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.080
frequent
>> Terminology.

4
00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:11.700
>> Terminology.

5
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:12.770
>> Right.
>> All right, got it, so-

6
00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:14.550
>> So, that's all we did.

7
00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:18.170
And hopefully, you've added everything to
your cheat sheet as we mentioned before.

8
00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.380
We also will supply some documents for
you to look at.

9
00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:22.080
>> It's possible.

10
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:22.660
>> Possible.
[LAUGH]

11
00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:23.640
>> Yeah and-

12
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:24.500
>> Keep a lookout.

13
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.450
>> Yeah, stay tuned for
the future modules,

14
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.860
because we're gonna go a lot more
in depth on the stuff you saw here.

15
00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:31.680
>> Yeah, right.

16
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.400
>> This is kinda just a little glimpse,

17
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.090
everything you kinda get
a chance to go search for.

18
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.560
Make sure you go check Google.

19
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.550
Do whatever you gotta do,
get your feet wet, and

20
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.770
we'll see you in the next module or
next lesson.
