00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.894
So, we just talked to you guys about IP or
Internet Protocol and that will tie in

2
00:00:04.894 --> 00:00:10.550
heavily to packet-switched networks, which
is what we're gonna talk about right now.

3
00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:14.119
>> Yeah, essentially we're taking what
is adapting the old school telephony

4
00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:18.539
circuit-switched networks, and now we're
gonna talk about packet-switched networks.

5
00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.871
>> Yeah, so, basically it's just a giant
network and how the data gets sent

6
00:00:23.871 --> 00:00:27.386
between devices or systems or whatever-
>> Networks.

7
00:00:27.386 --> 00:00:30.420
>> Yeah, between the networks,
are packets.

8
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.490
And we just talked about packets
in the previous section.

9
00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:38.010
So, packets, also known as
datagrams are just pieces of data

10
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.190
that need to be sent from somewhere to
somewhere else for the communication.

11
00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.180
And so the packet contains a header,
which is the destination, and

12
00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.262
then the payload,
which is the message or the data.

13
00:00:49.262 --> 00:00:56.367
And so normally, packets travel
through channels between nodes.

14
00:00:56.367 --> 00:01:00.025
They don't actually travel directly
from say here, if I was trying to

15
00:01:00.025 --> 00:01:04.140
send something to Robert, it might not
actually get sent directly to Robert.

16
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.940
Maybe this close it would.

17
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.290
But pretend we're like 100 miles away.

18
00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:09.650
It probably wouldn't get sent that way.

19
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.306
>> It's gonna bounce all over the place.

20
00:01:11.306 --> 00:01:13.520
>> And say onto my computer and
then onto a different network and

21
00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.720
onto a different and just bunny hop
all the way until it reaches Robert.

22
00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.670
Because it has the header which
contains a destination, right?

23
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.254
>> Yeah,
I think we actually have a slide for that,

24
00:01:22.254 --> 00:01:25.484
let's just go to the slide first actually,
how about that?

25
00:01:25.484 --> 00:01:28.352
So, you kinda see there
what he was talking about.

26
00:01:28.352 --> 00:01:32.242
You've all these different packets and
they know where they need to go,

27
00:01:32.242 --> 00:01:34.423
host 1 host 2, they need to get there.

28
00:01:34.423 --> 00:01:40.150
But they all might not take the same
path so eventually you'll have all

29
00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:45.600
the stuff you need, but probably not the-
>> Sometimes there's more complicated

30
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.830
things like a buffer where
it has to account for

31
00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.000
jitter and make sure everything is
arriving in the same time because

32
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.760
not all your packets
will take the same route.

33
00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.280
That could be a problem if you're trying
to make sure this packet receives, or

34
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.280
gets there first.

35
00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.870
>> Yeah, and this image is actually pulled
off Wikipedia too, so you can go ahead and

36
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:05.920
check it out over there.

37
00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.660
Search packet-switched networks, I think.

38
00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:08.309
Something like that.

39
00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:09.749
And you'll be able to
see this a little bit.

40
00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:12.720
>> [LAUGH]
>> More of an explanation.

41
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.590
So, we kind of skipped this slide,
I'm going back to it.

42
00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.360
But I just wanted to include this in here
because I thought it was really cool,

43
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.000
really interesting since
we're talking about VoiP.

44
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.150
It kind of breaks down everything,

45
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.090
I guess on a very high level, as to all
these things that we kind of have been or

46
00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.040
are going to talk about when it
comes to what we're working with.

47
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.550
And on the left side,
you can see you, right?

48
00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.030
So, you have all these different
types of devices that you can use

49
00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.580
to access the network, right,
or send or receive information.

50
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.050
On the top, you just have your
regular analog telephone.

51
00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.368
Old school regular telephone.

52
00:02:49.368 --> 00:02:53.665
I think what is it in the next module?

53
00:02:53.665 --> 00:02:57.065
The next module,
we're gonna talk about ATA,

54
00:02:57.065 --> 00:03:01.710
these different devices,
different ways to access your VoIP.

55
00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.960
Well, you can kinda see that there,
for your analog telephone,

56
00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.130
you need this ATA which is
an analog to digital converter.

57
00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.908
And then that'll get you
over to your router and

58
00:03:10.908 --> 00:03:15.493
then your router will you to the Internet
and then it has to go through the PSTN,

59
00:03:15.493 --> 00:03:18.432
which is the public
switched telephone network.

60
00:03:18.432 --> 00:03:22.030
So, I would recommend pausing this and
checking it out because it has everything.

61
00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:27.750
It has your analog phone, your VoIP phone-
>> Computer.

62
00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.520
>> Software, which would just
be like computer to computer.

63
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.430
Skype, for example, or
Linphone which we're gonna use later.

64
00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.610
And then it just has
mobile phones right here.

65
00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.650
So, it has everything on here.

66
00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:40.580
Take a look at it.

67
00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.900
And we might have to
actually include this in it.

68
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.810
Put this slide later on, too.

69
00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.240
Cool, yeah, hope you enjoyed it and
see you in the next video.
