00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:01.840
Hello all.

2
00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:07.140
Welcome to the specialization
on the internet of things,

3
00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:15.100
our viewpoint is the convergence
of multiple technologies.

4
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.560
We will talk about telephony
networks that we switched, and

5
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:24.190
a lot of innovations gave rise to
broadcast, radio and television.

6
00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:30.060
And that in turn led to consumer
electronics and the growth of content.

7
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:38.070
Around this time, 1972, DARPA
commissioned the Development of Internet

8
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.674
to do one thing that could not be
done with the telephony networks and

9
00:00:43.674 --> 00:00:48.110
the broadcast networks at that time,
that is reliability.

10
00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.240
And as we all know,
Internet delivered on reliability and

11
00:00:53.240 --> 00:01:00.520
went on to subsume the functionality of
telephony networks and broadcast networks.

12
00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:07.330
So, the next big converging
technology was wireless technologies,

13
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.300
and that gave us wireless Internet and
the smartphones.

14
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:18.190
And, in this course, we are going
to use the smartphone platform

15
00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:24.570
to teach you the internet of things,
and what the future might be.

16
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.710
The IOT platform, the indications,
or it will give us new products and

17
00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:36.270
services in this phase of automotive
industry, health care, robotics.

18
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.530
The unique thing about this course.

19
00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:44.650
This series of courses is it's
completely hands on and lab oriented.

20
00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.889
And I would like to come and
introduce the lab parts about that.

21
00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:51.792
Hello come on in.

22
00:01:51.792 --> 00:01:53.490
>> Hey thanks, Arty.

23
00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.850
Hey's guys, you're probably all looking to
take this class because you're interested

24
00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.940
in building your own internet of things.

25
00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.480
And I think you've come
to the right place.

26
00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.060
This is gonna be really hands on.

27
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.540
Most of the courses here
are built by the students of UCSD.

28
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.400
You're gonna be working with this
Arrow Electronics DragonBoard 410c,

29
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.690
which runs the Qualcomm Snapdragon
processor.

30
00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.960
This is kind of you can think of it
like if you take out your smartphone,

31
00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.040
open up the hood.

32
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.610
What you'll find is components in here.

33
00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.740
So, this will form the core of our course.

34
00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.780
To follow along you would buy one
of these, which is not a big deal,

35
00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.400
it's not that expensive.

36
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.675
But I wanna pause here and

37
00:02:29.675 --> 00:02:34.068
kind of give you a snapshot of what you're
gonna experience throughout this course.

38
00:02:34.068 --> 00:02:38.300
You're gonna see some of the lab
projects you'll be building.

39
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.592
And after that, you'll finally end up with
the Capstone project where you'll create

40
00:02:42.592 --> 00:02:45.021
your own ideas and
build on it using the 410c.

41
00:02:45.021 --> 00:02:49.283
Anyway, I'll leave now,
give a little trailer of what you're gonna

42
00:02:49.283 --> 00:02:52.837
experience in the course and
hope to see you in course one.

43
00:02:52.837 --> 00:03:02.837
[MUSIC]

44
00:03:20.811 --> 00:03:24.156
>> Hey guys I want to introduce you to
the rest of the team that made the move

45
00:03:24.156 --> 00:03:24.730
possible.

46
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.510
I wanna start with Robert here.

47
00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:27.624
But before that I wanna say this.

48
00:03:27.624 --> 00:03:29.690
Two students are missing here.

49
00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.805
Randy and but you'll get to see
them later throughout the course.

50
00:03:32.805 --> 00:03:34.960
Start with the chief of student's, Robert.

51
00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.070
>> Thanks I'm Robert Wolf.

52
00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.000
I just recently graduated here at
UCSD with electrical engineering and

53
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.375
I look forward to meeting everyone
throughout these courses coming up.

54
00:03:42.375 --> 00:03:45.905
>> I'm Eric I'm a grad student in
the ECE department here at UCSD and

55
00:03:45.905 --> 00:03:47.847
I'm here to teach you guys some Parkour.

56
00:03:47.847 --> 00:03:49.344
>> [LAUGH]
>> Just kidding.

57
00:03:49.344 --> 00:03:54.268
We're [CROSSTALK] [LAUGH]
>> My name is Jacob I'm a third-year here,

58
00:03:54.268 --> 00:03:56.820
studying computer science at UCSD.

59
00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.129
And I'm ready for the course.

60
00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:02.430
>> And I'm Arjan Makyun.

61
00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.740
I'm also a third year at UCSD
doing computer engineering.

62
00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:09.128
And I'm gonna have a great time
doing these courses with you guys.

63
00:04:09.128 --> 00:04:11.990
>> And, finally,
I wanna introduce you to the video crew,

64
00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:13.600
which made the whole course possible.

65
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.968
Hector, Alex, Joe,
please come in and say hi.

66
00:04:15.968 --> 00:04:17.965
>> [APPLAUSE]
>> Do a little selfie of yourself.

67
00:04:17.965 --> 00:04:21.359
>> [LAUGH]
>> Hopefully we'll see you guys in course

68
00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:22.260
one, please come back.
