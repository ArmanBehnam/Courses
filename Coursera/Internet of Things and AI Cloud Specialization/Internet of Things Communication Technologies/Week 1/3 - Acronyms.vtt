00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:05.028
As Randy mentioned in our introduction,
this is the first video and

2
00:00:05.028 --> 00:00:08.731
as always we start off with the acronyms
of things you're gonna see for

3
00:00:08.731 --> 00:00:10.080
the rest of this course.

4
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.010
Now, the more you put into this
particular section the less

5
00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:17.680
your gonna have to put in later.

6
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.031
Cuz all of these terms and
acronyms that we're gonna talk about,

7
00:00:20.031 --> 00:00:21.150
obviously they're gonna be.

8
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.770
>> Yeah, they come up multiple times.

9
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:23.470
>> Come up all the time.

10
00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:24.630
You don't wanna have to go reference it.

11
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.240
And if you do have to reference it,

12
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.830
then might as well reference
your cheat sheet, right?

13
00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:29.264
>> Right.
>> So we're gonna have you make one of

14
00:00:29.264 --> 00:00:31.340
those, just like all the other courses.

15
00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.000
Starting off right here, what is VoIP?

16
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.530
VoIP, an acronym,
Voice over Internet Protocol.

17
00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.651
Now Internet Protocol also on the slides
here that you can see is basically

18
00:00:40.651 --> 00:00:45.171
a set of rules that's used to transfer
data over what we would call the Internet,

19
00:00:45.171 --> 00:00:49.650
intranet, or any sort of network that
functions under the Internet Protocol.

20
00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.020
On this list you see a lot of
other cool little acronyms,

21
00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.410
things that you're gonna see throughout
the remainder of this course.

22
00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.230
But some ones that we'd like to point out,
cuz this list is very long.

23
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.490
PSTN, public switched telephone network,
now that's a way for us

24
00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.390
to kind of communicate with the old-school
telephony networks with VoIP network.

25
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.660
So it's kind of the gateway to kind of-
>> So it connects them all.

26
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:19.920
>> Yeah, connects everything in there.

27
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.240
So that's the gateway that connects VoIP
with old school circuit switch networks.

28
00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.790
We have SIP, we're gonna go really
in depth in that in the next module.

29
00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:34.090
You'll get to see a lot about that, just
basically session initiation protocol.

30
00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.446
And then the ATA, which also we're gonna
go into as well, which is just a form or

31
00:01:38.446 --> 00:01:42.546
a little device that you can hook into
your traditional telephone to give it

32
00:01:42.546 --> 00:01:46.410
a analog to digital converter to
send your packets over the internet.

33
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:47.330
>> Right.

34
00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.270
>> Right, so here we go.

35
00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:50.330
>> So next-
>> Some more-

36
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:51.742
>> Yeah, we have a lot of,

37
00:01:51.742 --> 00:01:54.650
there are tons of different
kinds of protocols.

38
00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:56.890
So we got a couple here listed.

39
00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.855
RTP, so that's Real-Time Transport
Protocol, where basically the goal is to

40
00:02:01.855 --> 00:02:06.090
try to get real-time data because
sometimes you're sending data,

41
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.310
you might have a delay to make
sure everything gets sent.

42
00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.145
And that might be really annoying
cuz you want it instantly, right?

43
00:02:13.145 --> 00:02:14.558
>> [LAUGH]
>> So there you go, real time.

44
00:02:14.558 --> 00:02:16.898
But then there's UDP and TCP.

45
00:02:16.898 --> 00:02:20.416
And they're sort of opposites of
each other, where the user datagram,

46
00:02:20.416 --> 00:02:24.118
without setting up any kind of channels,
it just sends the data right away.

47
00:02:24.118 --> 00:02:27.720
And then TCP, where it just
makes a connection beforehand.

48
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.802
So you lose less data,
but it's a bit slower.

49
00:02:31.802 --> 00:02:34.040
>> Yeah in a later module
you'll see a datagram.

50
00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.500
I know we threw that out there but
you'll see it in a nice datagram.

51
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:37.420
We'll show you how it works and stuff.

52
00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:38.500
>> Right.

53
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.630
>> Some other cool acronyms here
that you might see us mention or

54
00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.020
you might see on the, on the-
>> Following modules.

55
00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.630
>> In the following modules right here.

56
00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.520
Just kinda take a look at it,
take some time.

57
00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.320
Some interesting ones we think
transport layer security.

58
00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.362
You'll notice every time you kind of
connect to the internet or do something

59
00:02:54.362 --> 00:02:57.610
like that you might have to choose what
kind of security you'd like to set for it.

60
00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.070
>> Yeah,
a certain kind of encryption pattern, or

61
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.290
something like that to make sure that
someone can't just steal your data.

62
00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.323
>> Yeah exactly.
So, you can always go search the Internet,

63
00:03:07.323 --> 00:03:08.940
find out a little bit more.

64
00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.810
Go to Wikipedia about it.

65
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.210
Pause it, pause the slide right there.

66
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:16.180
Go back, pause it and take a look at it.

67
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.340
Next one, something really interesting,
one at least I'll talk about the IPvX.

68
00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.540
The X is actually just a variable for
the version number so

69
00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.780
you have the Internet protocol version x.

70
00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.750
>> Right.
>> Right, so the first actual kind of

71
00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:36.150
prominent version of the IP or
the Internet Protocol was the version 4.

72
00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.090
Right now,
I think the successor is version 6.

73
00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.990
But yeah, again, go search
Internet Protocol on the Internet,

74
00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:46.050
you'll get the Wiki page.

75
00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.500
You can read up a lot more about that.

76
00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.290
Maybe search IPv4 or IPv6.

77
00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.765
You can probably read up a lot more
about the different versions of

78
00:03:53.765 --> 00:03:54.711
the Internet protocol.

79
00:03:54.711 --> 00:03:58.671
Just the rules that were created and
we kind of abide by.

80
00:03:58.671 --> 00:04:00.870
Yeah, so GUI, ICE.

81
00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.577
You've seen GUI in other of our courses.

82
00:04:03.577 --> 00:04:08.950
GTK, XML,
XML's a type of data that's sent.

83
00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:09.930
So there we go.

84
00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.132
That was our-
>> That was our-

85
00:04:11.132 --> 00:04:12.252
>> Our set of acronyms.

86
00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:12.872
>> Our beefy acronym slides.

87
00:04:12.872 --> 00:04:15.154
>> Make sure you go back,
put those on your cheat sheet,

88
00:04:15.154 --> 00:04:16.692
things you might wanna reference.

89
00:04:16.692 --> 00:04:18.312
>> Right, so we'll see you next time.

90
00:04:18.312 --> 00:04:18.812
>> Great.
