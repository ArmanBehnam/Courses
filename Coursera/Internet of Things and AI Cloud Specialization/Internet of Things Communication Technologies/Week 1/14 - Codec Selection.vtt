00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:02.920
Welcome to the Codec Selection video.

2
00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:09.430
Randy put together a nice little group of
slides here for you to kinda talk about

3
00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:15.300
the codecs that are gonna be
involved in our venture into VoIP.

4
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:21.241
>> Right, so as promised,
we'll be talking more about codecs.

5
00:00:21.241 --> 00:00:22.866
>> We actually have a whole
module on codecs, I think.

6
00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:23.725
>> Right, yeah, we will.

7
00:00:23.725 --> 00:00:25.170
>> Yeah.

8
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.244
>> We'll,
more like a broad overview of the [LAUGH].

9
00:00:30.244 --> 00:00:31.486
>> No, yeah, of course, yeah.

10
00:00:31.486 --> 00:00:34.492
>> So, codecs basically,
as mentioned before,

11
00:00:34.492 --> 00:00:39.430
encoding decoding digital data signal or
some kind of stream.

12
00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.356
Some examples we have are FFmpeg, DivX,

13
00:00:44.356 --> 00:00:49.440
or H.264, all these codecs are used.

14
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.303
You might have heard about them,
you're might have heard of DivX.

15
00:00:52.303 --> 00:00:55.461
>> Yeah, DivX is a big one.

16
00:00:55.461 --> 00:00:59.592
Yeah, there's also standard codecs
that come with each kind of

17
00:00:59.592 --> 00:01:02.640
individual operating system, so to say.

18
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.090
Android has a specific set of codecs that
they like to include in their source.

19
00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.150
And then you have other codecs,
like with Ubuntu,

20
00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.660
that they like to include in their source,
for example, GStreamer.

21
00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:14.720
But, yeah.

22
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.090
>> So yeah, but then you sort of wonder
why can't we just use one codec for

23
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.430
encoding, decoding,
why do we need multiple ones?

24
00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.660
And that's simply because, depends on what
kind of project you wanna take, right?

25
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:35.460
So, if you have, mostly the argument
with lossy versus lossless compression.

26
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.640
So, you have lossless compression,
basically it means the picture, or audio,

27
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.384
or video quality is really, really high,
but that takes up a ton of space.

28
00:01:45.384 --> 00:01:50.950
Blu-ray DVDs,
has 30 to 50 gigs for one movie.

29
00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.870
How many movies can you store on
a compter if you were to do that,

30
00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.240
right, on a normal computer?

31
00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.610
>> Yeah, I think compressed movies
are sometimes what, five gigs?

32
00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.850
>> Yeah, honestly, like I said, it depends
on if you want the best quality you can

33
00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:13.070
get or sacrifice some quality but
have more, be able to store more.

34
00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:18.570
And also, that ties into video streaming,
so if you wanna see super high streamed,

35
00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:24.270
like Netflix videos,
you need the different kind of codec

36
00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.029
to make sure you'll be able to still
stream it at a decent speed, at least.

37
00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:32.760
And then, we also mentioned,

38
00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.420
or if you have trouble maybe seeing video
or listening to some kind of audio,

39
00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.175
it's probably because you're
missing some kind of codec.

40
00:02:38.175 --> 00:02:40.680
>> Yeah.

41
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.317
>> Because we encountered that problem
once or twice on using Ubuntu, I believe.

42
00:02:45.317 --> 00:02:49.042
>> During the release of Ubuntu, actually
during the release of the DragonBoard,

43
00:02:49.042 --> 00:02:51.685
there was a codec that we wanted and
it wasn't included.

44
00:02:51.685 --> 00:02:56.175
So, we went on the 96 Board forums,
which you should be registered for, and

45
00:02:56.175 --> 00:02:58.365
we expressed our concern and
they included it.

46
00:02:58.365 --> 00:03:00.025
So, they do listen everything.

47
00:03:00.025 --> 00:03:03.280
It's a very open community,
a very nice community.

48
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.130
And if you're ever encountering something,

49
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.380
hit those forms up and
get something going.

50
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.970
>> And then here, I wanted to expand
a bit more on codecs versus containers.

51
00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.524
So, remember codecs aren't containers.

52
00:03:17.524 --> 00:03:22.516
And then remember containers are just
the file extension such as .avi, or .mov,

53
00:03:22.516 --> 00:03:24.660
or .mp4, .wav, etc.

54
00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.768
And so, containers just have audio or
video codecs,

55
00:03:28.768 --> 00:03:33.807
as well as whatever other data needed for
that little container.

56
00:03:33.807 --> 00:03:35.430
So, a container's just a bundle.

57
00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.190
So maybe you have subtitles, or some
kind of other necessary information for

58
00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.410
playback or recording.

59
00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:49.910
And finally,
the sections labeled Codec Selection.

60
00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:51.751
So, which one do you wanna use?

61
00:03:51.751 --> 00:03:54.490
I also mentioned this earlier,
so it depends.

62
00:03:54.490 --> 00:04:00.378
Do you want lossless compression or
do you want lossy compression,

63
00:04:00.378 --> 00:04:04.318
where you have large
file versus small file?

64
00:04:04.318 --> 00:04:08.125
It also depends because if
you have very slow Internet,

65
00:04:08.125 --> 00:04:12.742
you're probably gonna have to use
some kind of lossy compression,

66
00:04:12.742 --> 00:04:18.182
because there's no way you will send
a 30 gig file within a decent timeframe.

67
00:04:18.182 --> 00:04:20.063
>> 30 gig file within a two hour movie.

68
00:04:20.063 --> 00:04:21.700
[CROSSTALK] It's possible.

69
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.290
>> That's gonna take
a while on a slow Internet.

70
00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:24.729
>> Yeah.

71
00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:28.312
>> And some other factors is
the resolution of your files,

72
00:04:28.312 --> 00:04:32.860
how many bits you wanna use to encode or
decode, stuff like that.

73
00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.100
>> Yeah, but I guess the point
right there, is right, so

74
00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.721
you use one codec to encode something?

75
00:04:36.721 --> 00:04:39.080
>> Mm-hm, and
use the same one to decode it.

76
00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.798
>> Yeah.
>> Basically it.

77
00:04:40.798 --> 00:04:44.887
>> Yeah, and so,
you're actually gonna see our esteemed

78
00:04:44.887 --> 00:04:49.759
Professor Harnoth Garadodgi come
back in one of our modules here,

79
00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:54.430
where he will be going over codecs
among several other things.

80
00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.490
So I think that's in module three,
not the next.

81
00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.540
Yeah, so two modules from now,

82
00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:05.320
you'll get a chance to check him out and
hear some really cool stuff about codecs.

83
00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:09.560
He's actually worked in that field for
quite a while, and not

84
00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:14.020
necessarily the codec field but this whole
compression, digital signal processing.

85
00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.600
He's worked in that field for a long time.

86
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.430
So, he'll have some really interesting
stuff to talk to you all about and

87
00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:21.840
hope you stick around for it.

88
00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.740
So, that being said, I guess we're good.

89
00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.050
>> Yeah.
>> With the codec section,

90
00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:26.420
we'll see you in next videos.
