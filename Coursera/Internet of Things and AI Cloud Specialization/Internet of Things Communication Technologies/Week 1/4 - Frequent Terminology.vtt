00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:03.649
All right, Randy,
tell us what's behind door number two.

2
00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:06.151
[LAUGH]
>> So door number two actually contains

3
00:00:06.151 --> 00:00:09.150
frequent terminology that
we'll cover in this course.

4
00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:09.960
>> Excellent, excellent.

5
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.456
>> So let's go ahead and get started.
>> Take a look at it, all right.

6
00:00:11.456 --> 00:00:16.069
>> So, yeah, you heard these terms
earlier, Protocol, Datagrams,

7
00:00:16.069 --> 00:00:18.620
Packets, Internet Protocol Suite.

8
00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.080
So protocol is a set of rules for how
the systems communicate, datagrams, same

9
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.670
thing, are packets where it's just data
to be sent between devices on a network.

10
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.611
And Internet Protocol Suite is just
another name for the Internet Protocol,

11
00:00:34.611 --> 00:00:38.565
pretty cool, but so the big deals
are the codecs and containers.

12
00:00:38.565 --> 00:00:46.890
So Codec was just a way
to say a coder-decoder so

13
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.910
that means it'll encode say,
some kind of audio or

14
00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:57.770
voice signal and then later on,
the same codec will be used to decode it.

15
00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.010
This allows for easy or
better transmission because

16
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.820
sending a big file is gonna be too hard
and then you also need to use the same

17
00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.860
codec to decode it because you'd be
using the same algorithm for the coding.

18
00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.118
>> How nifty that they called it codec.

19
00:01:14.118 --> 00:01:15.363
>> Yeah.
>> Coder, decoder.

20
00:01:15.363 --> 00:01:17.658
[LAUGH]
>> I would've never thought of that.

21
00:01:17.658 --> 00:01:21.632
Often times though codecs get confused for
something called containers and

22
00:01:21.632 --> 00:01:24.736
containers are just file formats
that contain the codecs,

23
00:01:24.736 --> 00:01:28.291
right, so containers could be like
a dot wav file, dot mp3, etc.

24
00:01:28.291 --> 00:01:33.975
And finally we will be talking about
something called the GStreamer and

25
00:01:33.975 --> 00:01:38.630
that's just for the, I believe,
the Bluetooth system.

26
00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.660
>> So yeah, we're not gonna go
too much into GStreamer, however,

27
00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.990
you do just kind of need to understand
it's kind of a bunch of codecs that come.

28
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.524
>> Yeah, like an all-in-one.

29
00:01:46.524 --> 00:01:50.460
>> It's like an all-in-one and
it comes in your newest release of Ubuntu.

30
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.280
So since we're gonna be mainly working
with Android on this particular,

31
00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.920
this particular course, you are welcome
and in the next module actually,

32
00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.720
we're gonna talk about Linphone, and
you can get it on Ubuntu, and Android for

33
00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.420
your dragon board 410C.

34
00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.713
But, you know, these are the codecs
that you're probably gonna be using,

35
00:02:10.713 --> 00:02:14.460
is these GStreamer,
this GStreamer set and yeah.

36
00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.361
So we might mention a little bit about it,
it might come up, it's good to know there,

37
00:02:18.361 --> 00:02:22.106
I'd recommend searching for it and kinda
learning a little bit more about it, but

38
00:02:22.106 --> 00:02:24.249
yeah, it's gonna mainly be used for
Ubuntu.

39
00:02:24.249 --> 00:02:25.189
Yeah.

40
00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:26.114
>> Huh.
>> So yeah, so

41
00:02:26.114 --> 00:02:27.454
we'll see you in the next videos.

42
00:02:27.454 --> 00:02:28.986
What, next lesson already, right?

43
00:02:28.986 --> 00:02:29.833
>> Yeah, next lesson already.

44
00:02:29.833 --> 00:02:33.478
[CROSSTALK]
>> With this, hopefully you have a nice

45
00:02:33.478 --> 00:02:38.130
cheat sheet to look at to reference
later on, so see you next time.
