00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:02.600
Well Randy, it's time to take a look back.

2
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:03.110
>> Mm- hm.

3
00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.470
At what we all, what you should've
learned [LAUGH] in this lesson.

4
00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:09.380
>> And so Randy,
talked to you about software stack.

5
00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.170
You know, kind of,
what kind of developer are you?

6
00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:12.670
>> Mm hm.
>> Right?

7
00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:13.980
You know, you could be developing on

8
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.880
the front end, on the back end.

9
00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:16.614
Or are you a full stack?

10
00:00:16.614 --> 00:00:17.600
[CROSSTALK]
>> Right.

11
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.290
>> Hey, that is full stack?

12
00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:19.132
>> Yeah, full stack developer.

13
00:00:19.132 --> 00:00:20.670
>> Are you a full stack developer?

14
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.970
I know that probably most of you at home,
you're probably all full stack developers.

15
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.930
At least throughout this course
unless you're working on a team,

16
00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.340
maybe sharing responsibilities or duties.

17
00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:33.580
>> But yeah, so that was kind
of interesting little, I guess.

18
00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:34.840
>> Yeah, it's a good way to divide up,

19
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.820
say like you don't really wanna focus on
how the app looks but your friend does.

20
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.910
So, he can work with that while you can.

21
00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.770
Say, implement all the GPIO functions.

22
00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:43.940
>> Yeah, there you go.

23
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.360
And then, internet protocol, kinda talked
to you a little bit about that, and

24
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.680
how it relates to the datagram packets.

25
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.830
>> Yeah, and then,
we talked packet-switched networks,

26
00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:53.180
which is like the new thing.

27
00:00:53.180 --> 00:01:00.028
The new network that the VoIP users,
where it sends packets from A to B.

28
00:01:00.028 --> 00:01:03.330
>> Randy, now so
>> How does this all relate to VoIP?

29
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.810
>> Oh, that's very simple, so,
let's just go ahead and start,

30
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.500
just go down the list and
start with software stack.

31
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.790
So, you're probably gonna make a VoIP
application of some sort, right?

32
00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:13.730
>> Hope so.
>> Yeah.

33
00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:18.010
So, as a front end developer you need
to make it somewhat nice looking.

34
00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:22.570
Why would you want an app that
just has a single button?

35
00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.910
>> That just, you don't know
what the button does, right?

36
00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:26.330
That would be really weird.

37
00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.370
And then, on the backend you got to make
sure all your VoIP functions working,

38
00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:37.770
say your audio, your mic, you want
to be able to make sure there's some

39
00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.760
kind of connection between the receiver
when you make a phone call because, and

40
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.420
you also want to make sure You're
saying your call to the right place.

41
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.350
What's the point of like.

42
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.972
>> Actually, yeah.

43
00:01:46.972 --> 00:01:48.140
>> [LAUGH]
>> Pretty important.

44
00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.250
>> Like, I'm gonna call you, but
I end up calling someone else?

45
00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.290
That would be really weird.

46
00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.990
And VoIP is also, sorry.

47
00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.740
Internet protocol and

48
00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.580
impact switch networks are a big
deal with VoIP because, that's what.

49
00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:01.200
>> It's in the word.

50
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.700
>> Yeah, it's.

51
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.400
>> Or it's in the acronym, right?

52
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.300
>> That's what VoIP uses.

53
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:10.400
Instead of the traditional telephone, so

54
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:17.130
where they would use a telephone line or
an underwater fiber cable or something.

55
00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.740
Instead, we're just gonna be.

56
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.830
Sending all this voice
data through the internet.

57
00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.228
But the internet, to send data you
have to follow the internet protocol,

58
00:02:26.228 --> 00:02:29.710
hence VoIP, right?

59
00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:30.230
>> There you go.

60
00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.770
>> There you go.
And

61
00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:36.310
that's just a little nice summary,
how all this just ties right into VoIP.

62
00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.060
So, we'll see you in the next lesson,

63
00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.820
where we go over some
supplemental materials.
