00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:06.470
So, in this lesson I want to start with
the big picture of why there are so

2
00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:09.180
many codecs and what purpose they serve.

3
00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.140
The main purpose of a codec is
to reduce the number of bits

4
00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:19.208
it takes to represent some signal,
compress the data.

5
00:00:19.208 --> 00:00:23.600
So, why do we need to compress the data?

6
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.170
And, then why exactly does it work?

7
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.680
It will work only if we know
something about the signals.

8
00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.910
What is important in the signal, and
what is redundant in the signal.

9
00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:42.590
Once we know that, we can go ahead and
compress the signals.

10
00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.479
And, of course, there is a price to
be paid either for lossless/codecs or

11
00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:51.860
even codecs,
where some of the information is lost.

12
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:59.410
And that is it introduces latency, it
costs battery power to do the compression.

13
00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:05.160
So, we will look at the evaluation
criteria for assessing various codecs.
