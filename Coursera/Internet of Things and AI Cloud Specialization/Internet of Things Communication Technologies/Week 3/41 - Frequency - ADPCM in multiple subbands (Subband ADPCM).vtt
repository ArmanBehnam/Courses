1
00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:07.580
So, to take advantage of redundancy in
the spectral domain frequency domain.

2
00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.100
We break the signal into
multiple sub-bands.

3
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:17.006
And this is what is called sub-band ADPCM.

4
00:00:17.006 --> 00:00:17.506
So.

5
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:24.156
The G dot 722 standard
is a wide-band codec

6
00:00:24.156 --> 00:00:29.580
operating at 16 kilohertz input signal.

7
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:37.260
So, the first thing we do is
split the signal into two bands.

8
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.770
Lower band, upper band using QMF,
quadrature mirror filters.

9
00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.180
There is actually a typo in this picture.

10
00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.380
I noticed it very late.

11
00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.450
It's not quadratic,
it's quadrature mirror filter.

12
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:58.580
So, in the lower sub-band Which is
actually shown on the top of the picture.

13
00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:04.130
We use 4, or 5, or 6 bits per sample and

14
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:08.120
we use just 2 bits for
the band that goes for

15
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.900
4 kilohertz to 8 kilohertz.

16
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:19.860
8 or 16 kilobits per second for
site channel information.

17
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.680
That is on the top band if you're
using 6 bits you do not have any

18
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:25.910
site band information.

19
00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:32.640
If you're using 4 bits per sample you
get 16 kilobits site channel information

20
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:39.410
this you can use for in bad transmission
of other music related content.

21
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:48.590
On the receiver side, we use synthesis
quadratic mirror filters and

22
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.390
each of the Input streams for upper and

23
00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.940
lower bands,
they go through the same ADPCM decoder and

24
00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.090
then, we combine them with
the synthesis filter.

25
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:11.270
So, the QMF filters have a very nice
property called perfect reconstruction.

26
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.070
Even though the analysis filters
do not have really sharp

27
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.840
cutoff, they do have some overlap.

28
00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:29.260
We still use critical sampling and down
sample each stream by a factor of two.

29
00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.740
Now, there is going to be aliasing error.

30
00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.190
So, the combination of analysis and

31
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.180
synthesis filters cancel this aliasing and
result in the original signal.

32
00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.890
That's why they're called perfect
reconstruction filter banks.

33
00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:50.760
So, the QMF filters and polyface
filters that share the same property

34
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:57.220
are used in many other forms
of Transform based codex

35
00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:02.370
that exploit information, or
exploit density in the frequency domain.
