00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:07.190
In this lesson, we will look at a class
of codecs called Waveform Codecs.

2
00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:12.640
So, in waveform coding, we exploit
the redundancy in the amplitude domain,

3
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.890
time domain, and frequency domain.

4
00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:21.980
In some codecs, we operate in more
than one domain simultaneously.

5
00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:28.270
There are many,
many ITUT codecs used in VOIP services and

6
00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:33.330
they all go by the name at G.7xx.

7
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.051
So we will look at few codecs that
will exploit all these three different

8
00:00:37.051 --> 00:00:37.802
principles.
