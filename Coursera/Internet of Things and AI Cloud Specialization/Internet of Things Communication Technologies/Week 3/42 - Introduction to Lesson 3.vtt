1
00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:04.920
In this lesson,
we look at parametric codecs

2
00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:14.310
that actually take advantage of our
knowledge of human speech production.

3
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:20.030
We make an engineering model based
on the theory of linear prediction.

4
00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:26.610
These codecs, based on anywhere from
half a bit to 1.5 bits per sample,

5
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:31.494
fit the quality that closely
matches the 8 kilobits per

6
00:00:31.494 --> 00:00:37.290
sample of narrow band
speech [COUGH] excuse me,

7
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.880
and in some of the newer versions,
even wide band speech.

8
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:51.210
And, we will look at some of
the codecs used in the 2G/3G networks,

9
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.820
based on the LPC principle.

10
00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.000
Then we look at some
voice quality assessment

11
00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.880
metrics in order to actually go
around comparing various codecs.

12
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.980
Finally, there's some twists and
turns when we use these codecs that were

13
00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.140
mostly developed for
search history networks.

14
00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.390
We bring them into packet switching.

15
00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.050
What are the things that
we need to watch out for?
