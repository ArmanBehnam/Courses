1
00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.770
So, I would like us to visit
the speech production model.

2
00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:08.719
We saw this picture in correspond.

3
00:00:09.817 --> 00:00:17.150
Fund proposed this source
code to theory to remind you.

4
00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:23.290
There is the vocal tract that
varies very very slowly.

5
00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:24.200
And.

6
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.540
That's the filter, and

7
00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:31.960
there is the input, which is the source,
that's driving this filter.

8
00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.485
And the source is based the vocal cords.

9
00:00:34.485 --> 00:00:42.069
[INAUDIBLE] signals the vocal chords,
like and for sounds like [SOUND].

10
00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:47.080
There is a random input
into the vocal track.

11
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:52.170
And sense this vocal track
shape is changing very slowly

12
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.380
depending on the sounds we produce.

13
00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:01.190
We can make a very good
engineering model to approximate.

14
00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.630
This production and generate
really good quality speech sounds.

15
00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:13.370
And this is really what
the LPC model does.

16
00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.770
So there is an impulse generator running
at the same rate as the pitch period.

17
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.624
There is a noise generator to
simulate sounds like S and

18
00:01:26.624 --> 00:01:31.503
F, and
there is this voiced/unvoiced switch,

19
00:01:31.503 --> 00:01:35.430
and there is the actual linear filter,

20
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.547
the all-pole model which
models the vocal track,

21
00:01:40.547 --> 00:01:45.188
so the task is given
a short segment of speech,

22
00:01:45.188 --> 00:01:48.890
usually 20 to 30 milliseconds.

23
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.600
How do we compute the best
possible parameters,

24
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.220
the filter, the filter gain, pitch period?

25
00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.770
And this segment is wise or
unwise by best possible parameters.

26
00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.560
What we mean is when we
reconstruct the signal,

27
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.230
it sounds as close to
the original speech as possible.

28
00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.230
And when we do this, we can get

29
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.150
point five to one point five bits per
sample, instead of eight bits per sample.
