00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:02.720
Hello all, welcome back.

2
00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:08.200
So in this module, we will look at codecs,
that is coders and

3
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:14.220
decoders, to make more efficient use
of the data plane in communications.

4
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:15.855
So we have three lessons.

5
00:00:15.855 --> 00:00:20.980
One is motivation for
studying source codings,

6
00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.855
codecs are based on taking advantage
of redundancy in the signals.

7
00:00:25.855 --> 00:00:30.775
In the second lesson,
we will look at how to take advantage of

8
00:00:30.775 --> 00:00:35.506
redundancy just by looking at
the waveform of the signal.

9
00:00:35.506 --> 00:00:40.307
And then, finally, we will look at
codecs that are based on taking

10
00:00:40.307 --> 00:00:45.455
advantage of the knowledge of these
sources that generate the signal,

11
00:00:45.455 --> 00:00:47.370
like the the vocal track.

12
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.028
And the receiver,

13
00:00:49.028 --> 00:00:55.380
that as the human hearing that they
are trying to communicate with.

14
00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.610
These are called parametric codecs.

15
00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:03.152
And we will look at some of
the VoIP-related issues when we go from

16
00:01:03.152 --> 00:01:05.891
circuit switched to packet switched.
