00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.760
So, there are many, many applications for

2
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.020
which we would really like
to compress the data.

3
00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:13.810
The first one, obviously, is to
increases the capacity of the system.

4
00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:19.570
There is an ever growing need for data as
more and more people are subscribing to

5
00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:26.040
the wired and wireless broadband
services to access data.

6
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:31.540
This is a picture of per capita
subscriptions world wide in year 2012.

7
00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:38.610
There are a lot more people with
mobile phones than with a tooth brush.

8
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.320
And still, there are many many areas.

9
00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.330
On this map that are grey or
pale blue in this picture

10
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.320
that is addressable market for
this technology.

11
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.300
They would all want to talk to each
other once they get the phone.

12
00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:02.666
So, we need an efficient way to transport
all that voice traffic or data traffic.

13
00:01:06.424 --> 00:01:09.892
The second big reason why we would want,

14
00:01:09.892 --> 00:01:14.686
is we really want an efficient
representation of data so

15
00:01:14.686 --> 00:01:19.450
that we can store a lot of data for
playback later.

16
00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.180
With ever increasing content,
voice content,

17
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.060
music, video, text on the internet.

18
00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.180
There are many many more
applications than just iPod,

19
00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.780
or kindle, or Netflix and YouTube.

20
00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.730
For example, The World Digital Library
is an international digital library

21
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:47.650
operated by UNESCO, and
the US Library of Congress.

22
00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:53.220
It aims to expand non-English, and
non-western content on the Internet,

23
00:01:53.220 --> 00:02:00.710
and contribute to scholarly
research As of 2015, at least

24
00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:06.140
more than 12,000 items from nearly 200
countries, dating back to 8000 BC.

25
00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:14.380
So, you can see that, if we have very
efficient representation of content, it

26
00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.730
lets us search for that, playback later,
all kinds of different applications.

27
00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.100
And then there is a third class of
applications that comes to mind.

28
00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.980
If we have a compact representation,
we can use this for

29
00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.410
mission learning and mission intelligence.

30
00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.040
This is exactly how Siri works.

31
00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.800
Some of the voice recognition
technologies share the feature

32
00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:49.190
extraction components that
resource completion techniques.

33
00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:55.380
This is how we can build analytics
by analyzing lots and lots of data.

34
00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:01.740
This is how you can actually
make your cars trained to

35
00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:07.530
drive autonomously to look at
the traffic lights or pay attention to

36
00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.870
the surrounding noisy environments,
so we do want machines to learn.

37
00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:20.870
And then do routine things that makes
us attend to more important things.

38
00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:26.000
So, those are some of the cool
applications that you would need

39
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.850
to compress the data.
