Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.710
Welcome back to the specialization
on the Internet of things.

3
00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:08.650
So far we have looked at
circuit switch networks for

4
00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.550
voice calls, and
packet switch networks for data.

5
00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:18.180
In this module we will look at computer
telephony integration that gave birth to

6
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.070
a powerful network compromising
heterogeneous devices and services.

7
00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.900
In this context the computer stem cells
had an interesting run during this period,

8
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.770
the 60s and 70s,

9
00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:35.720
from main computers to mini computers
to micro computers and the PCs.

10
00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:42.060
This is a different story and we may get
back to it in future but I just wanted to

11
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:49.010
print your notice, this really fascinating
book that I read in college on

12
00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:56.020
two different teams within a company
building mini-computer architectures.

13
00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.400
Those were the days when I didn't
have a TV in each room, so

14
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.240
I would read a lot more.

15
00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.730
Fascinating book.

16
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.560
And the remainder of the course, we will
focus on the telephone side of the story,

17
00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.380
and how the computers and
telephone are integrated.
