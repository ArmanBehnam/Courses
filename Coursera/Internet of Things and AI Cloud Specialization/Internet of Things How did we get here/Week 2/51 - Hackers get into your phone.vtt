1
00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.522
Again, the SS7 network is what enabled

2
00:00:05.522 --> 00:00:10.877
the cell phone revolution that we will get

3
00:00:10.877 --> 00:00:16.844
to in the next module,
but people found that as

4
00:00:18.423 --> 00:00:24.490
The operators manage mobility, you move
from one cell tower to another cell tower.

5
00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.940
The leftovers of the SS7 messages,

6
00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:32.830
people could get through and
actually listen to your calls.

7
00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:38.970
And other technologies
like web cameras using

8
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:45.470
the all IP network, using SS7,
you could do exactly the same thing.

9
00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:51.720
There was another report that you could
watch baby cams in the neighborhood

10
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:57.620
just by attacking
the vulnerabilities in the network.

11
00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:04.671
So the takeaway message
from all of this is.

12
00:01:07.473 --> 00:01:13.692
How computers got really powerful
to enable complex operations for

13
00:01:13.692 --> 00:01:19.100
both signaling point and
the data plane processing.

14
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.080
Voice recognition, data processing, and

15
00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:29.010
all of this was possible with certain
aspects of the phone going digital,

16
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.870
and certain aspects going
packet switched networks.

17
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:38.711
So now, this is really what was
enabling portions circuit switched,

18
00:01:38.711 --> 00:01:41.200
portions package switched.

19
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:48.000
And in the next module we will add
wireless technologies to the mix.

20
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.310
And we will see how the cell phone
revolution started adding to

21
00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.490
this convergence that we now call
the internet of things platform.
