00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:07.870
So, with all the features that came onto

2
00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:13.990
the smart phone there were so many things
that you could do with the smart phone and

3
00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:19.519
people almost forgot that this was
a phone, it's meant for voice.

4
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.130
The most successful app,

5
00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:29.650
in this context, is SMS,
short message services.

6
00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.480
It is kind of like an email,
in the internet world,

7
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.990
in the sense it is
a store-and-forward service for

8
00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.150
purely text between two users.

9
00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:52.150
The SMS Excel it uses the SS7
control plane that we talked before

10
00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:57.490
and because we are leveraging
SS7 links for sending

11
00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.730
information to the device, but
not to another network element.

12
00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.600
They had to restrict
themselves to 140 bytes for

13
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.680
the payload that is all the information.

14
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.080
Just to have some space for the headers.

15
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:22.080
And since you didn't have to set up the
data plane to actually carry your voice.

16
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.140
You coul send this information very,
very cheap.

17
00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:32.650
There was 1000 X markup
in delivering an SMS.

18
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:40.610
So, if you're looking at trillions of
text messages that are sent across.

19
00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:47.440
That thousand x mark-up you can see
that this is a billion dollar business.

20
00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:55.330
Of 15% of global SMS are actually
commercial messages.

21
00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.851
And the Twitter is essentially
is an SMS kind of service,

22
00:02:00.851 --> 00:02:05.340
what you post still goes to your server.

23
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.220
But from the server,
instead of going to just another user,

24
00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.170
you broadcast it to a group of users.

25
00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.810
So as an app, Twitter gets the credit for
giving the capability to

26
00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.860
everybody to blog with just a cell
phone during the Arab Spring.

27
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.270
WhatsApp is another non-voice,
text-based app.

28
00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:39.326
Instead of building it on SS7 it was
built ground-up using Internet protocols,

29
00:02:39.326 --> 00:02:44.748
TCP/IP, and presence, and
presence and the advantage was,

30
00:02:44.748 --> 00:02:50.168
if a cell phone user already had
data access like smartphones,

31
00:02:50.168 --> 00:02:55.240
they're not paying the carriers for
SMS anymore.

32
00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:00.480
They, all the messaging that they use,
essentially becomes free,

33
00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.670
because they are paying just one price for
the data.

34
00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:11.200
Where I am going with all of this is,
there were so many other applications,

35
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.930
other than voice, and
voice still is the key application, but

36
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.790
you could, take pictures and
share them with a large group of people.

37
00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.180
Something that started in college
campuses to share pictures,

38
00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:36.629
grew into one of the big social media
happenings in the internet of things.

39
00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.030
Netflix.

40
00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:46.110
You have different kinds of
players providing the video

41
00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.414
content to the users on multiple screens.

42
00:03:50.414 --> 00:03:55.660
The camera plays a big role
on applications like YouTube,

43
00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:01.330
you can take the picture
anywhere you want, crime scenes,

44
00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.780
special happenings, and
then post them to YouTube.

45
00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.260
And now you have, almost like
you are on broadcast network, so

46
00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.710
many people can share the content.

47
00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:22.740
So, in this context, that the cellphone
has so many different capabilities.

48
00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:28.750
The operating systems
become really critical.

49
00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.300
And there were many many OS
battles that happened before.

50
00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.610
Right now, we are pretty much settled
on IOS, Windows, Android, and

51
00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:46.320
maybe even Linux, and we are going
to be covering some aspects of

52
00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.670
all of these OS in our upcoming courses.

53
00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.730
The main thing for you when you
choose an operating system is,

54
00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:03.040
you need to keep in mind what are the
applications that you want to develop.

55
00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:09.740
And if the operating system

56
00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:14.980
provides the right hooks to all
the sensors that you want to access,

57
00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:22.420
or maybe you would be adding
yourself to the smartphone platform,

58
00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:26.660
and we will be carrying you
through some of these things.

59
00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:32.300
And most of these operating systems,
they're also providing

60
00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:37.195
really powerful integrated
development environments for

61
00:05:37.195 --> 00:05:41.070
there app development,

62
00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:45.050
so that's a good thing for
us going forward.
