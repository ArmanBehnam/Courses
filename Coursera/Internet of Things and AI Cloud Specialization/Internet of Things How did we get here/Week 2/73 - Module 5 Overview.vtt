Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:05.150
Welcome back to the course
on the Internet of Things.

3
00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.660
So far, we have looked at
circular switch networks for

4
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.835
wireless calls,
packet switched networks for data, and

5
00:00:12.835 --> 00:00:18.240
we also saw how computer
telephony integration and

6
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:25.850
the wireless technologies resulted in this
powerful network of heterogeneous devices.

7
00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:33.060
In this module, we will focus on apps,
the birth of apps, and how they evolved.

8
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.910
At the risk of stating the obvious,
an app is a piece of code that does

9
00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.865
one specific function,
running on a phone or a tablet.

10
00:00:42.865 --> 00:00:49.140
[COUGH] In our case, I want you to
think of applications at scale.

11
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.220
Applications that leverage the network and
all the devices and

12
00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:59.810
people connected to the network and
the sensing capabilities,

13
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:06.870
processing capabilities, communication
capabilities of these devices.

14
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.270
This is what I hope to
convey in this module.

15
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:16.250
Before we actually start with the content,
I would like to give you an assignment,

16
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.480
as to what I want you to do
at the end of the course.

17
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:28.430
Think of an app, something that you really
would like to have, that's not available.

18
00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.510
And how much you would actually pay for
the app.

19
00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.160
And then, write a description,
maybe a video, maybe some text,

20
00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.340
maybe a blog diagram.

21
00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:46.100
If you're actually thinking of building
that app as part of this course,

22
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.990
make sure you secure your
IP before you publish it.

23
00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.750
Maybe you'll find other people who
would want to work with you on this.

24
00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.140
So, this is what I mean.

25
00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.090
I'll tell you my favorite app
that doesn't exist that I really,

26
00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:03.430
really would like to have.

27
00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:11.000
StoryCorps is a service that has

28
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.130
a database that has 50,000 interviews and
80,000 participants.

29
00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:22.034
It was funded by the US taxpayers.

30
00:02:22.034 --> 00:02:25.090
And after 10 years of
a very successful run,

31
00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.700
the founders released an app
on Android and iPhone.

32
00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.348
And now you can actually
record StoryCorps content,

33
00:02:36.348 --> 00:02:40.990
without having an access
to a professional studio.

34
00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:45.410
You can actually conduct the interviews
from you smart phone or a tablet.

35
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.760
Personally, what I would like
is an app that collects small

36
00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.480
audio segments of folk songs,
indigenous instruments

37
00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:03.830
that aborigines would use, or
ancient cultures from Afghanistan,

38
00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:08.160
Syria, Australia or
rural religions in India.

39
00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.250
I think this would be a great.

40
00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.410
I would really like to have it,
because it presents the culture, and

41
00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:20.260
it leverages the smartphone
audio capabilities.
