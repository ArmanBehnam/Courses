00:00:04.026 --> 00:00:09.090
Here in telephony billing is one
of the most important things.

2
00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.280
Apparently the billing system for
the telephone network

3
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.050
is only second to the IRS in US.

4
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.210
Anyway, you can see that the system
keeps track of you, wherever you are,

5
00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:33.060
how long talked, who called you,
for billing purposes.

6
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.390
So, it was a very small step to
have a counter in the system, and

7
00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.790
countdown your credits as you
are talking on your phone.

8
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:48.450
As long as you keep your SIM topped up,
your phone would work.

9
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.530
And this is how prepaid
services were bought.

10
00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:00.220
It turned out that this was much

11
00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:06.745
bigger deal than what
the business people anticipated.

12
00:01:06.745 --> 00:01:09.320
There were a lot of people

13
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.170
who did not have good credit
rating to get post paid services.

14
00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.880
Kids under 12 could not get contracts.

15
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.120
There are lots of places where
there are no credit institutions.

16
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:27.670
And even the ones that are there, they're
not accessible to many, many people.

17
00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:33.100
So a lot of cellular growth has
happened in developing countries.

18
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:39.960
In India the per capita land line
phones were about three for 100 people.

19
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.670
And now there's 73 mobile phones for
every 100 people.

20
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:51.469
They were able to leap frog the wire
line telephony directly to cellular.

21
00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:55.110
So, the prepaid was a significant factor

22
00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.110
in the growth of the cellular
industry worldwide.
