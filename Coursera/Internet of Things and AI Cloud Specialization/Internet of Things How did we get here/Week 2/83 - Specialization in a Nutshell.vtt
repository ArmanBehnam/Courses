1
00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:06.440
In this lesson, we're going to go over all the courses in this specialization,

2
00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.895
as you know there are six courses.

3
00:00:08.895 --> 00:00:11.385
You're watching Course 1.

4
00:00:11.385 --> 00:00:14.745
So, let me kind of go over what's in each of these courses.

5
00:00:14.745 --> 00:00:16.455
Let me switch the slides here.

6
00:00:16.455 --> 00:00:24.380
Course 2, this is the Introduction to DragonBoard and the 96Boards ecosystem.

7
00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.890
We'll show you all about waiting at the DragonBoard, unpacking,

8
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.525
installing the things you need,

9
00:00:30.525 --> 00:00:34.500
and setting up, so it's all DragonBoard oriented.

10
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.660
This form is kind of the core of the specialization.

11
00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:43.849
We'll also talk about the 96Boards specs to get the most of the on processors,

12
00:00:43.849 --> 00:00:46.280
so it's a pretty detailed course.

13
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.655
Course 3, we'll kind of move away from the DragonBoard a bit,

14
00:00:50.655 --> 00:00:52.740
it's about the Cloud Services.

15
00:00:52.740 --> 00:01:00.340
Very soon you'll hit maximum processing power off the DragonBoard,

16
00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:06.165
you can't do it on the board you have to off load processing to the cloud,

17
00:01:06.165 --> 00:01:10.715
so we have chosen Amazon Cloud Services as to follow along in this course,

18
00:01:10.715 --> 00:01:13.680
you're welcome to use other services.

19
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.120
Course 3 we're going to cover AWS.

20
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.854
How to set up on Amazon,

21
00:01:19.854 --> 00:01:22.610
what are the services offered in Amazon,

22
00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.275
all the image processing services.

23
00:01:25.275 --> 00:01:29.700
In particular, we're going to cover the Amazon IoT SDK kit.

24
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.960
There are two parts to the kit.

25
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.195
One is the server kit and there is the client kit,

26
00:01:33.195 --> 00:01:38.975
and you'll do a few projects in this specialization using the Amazon IoT SDK.

27
00:01:38.975 --> 00:01:42.906
So that's course by itself where it's not,

28
00:01:42.906 --> 00:01:47.910
we don't do too much on DragonBoard in Course 3 but it's a very useful course by itself,

29
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.551
it will get you up and running with Cloud Services.

30
00:01:51.551 --> 00:01:55.560
So now, let's move to Course 4.

31
00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.440
Course 4 and 5 got plenty of material,

32
00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.965
two and three form the backbone of the specialization.

33
00:02:01.965 --> 00:02:05.740
If you have finished two and three you'll be firing on all cylinders.

34
00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.860
You've got all the kind of basics you need to kind of build your own IoT.

35
00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.580
Three and four form offer some advanced concepts,

36
00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.845
in particular Course 4, communication.

37
00:02:17.845 --> 00:02:20.790
We do a lot of audio and MIDI.

38
00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.265
MIDI stands for music instrument digital interface.

39
00:02:25.265 --> 00:02:27.450
It's a protocol invented to kind of

40
00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.830
make musical instruments communicate with each other in an easy fashion,

41
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.555
like computers and all that.

42
00:02:33.555 --> 00:02:40.000
So we'll talk a lot about processing music signals in Course 4, using the DragonBoard.

43
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.255
Course 4 also forms the backbone of Capstone 1.

44
00:02:46.255 --> 00:02:49.440
We'll come to what Capstone 1 is a little bit later but

45
00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.355
we offer you all the fundamentals you need to deal with Capstone 1,

46
00:02:53.355 --> 00:02:54.990
if you want to follow along.

47
00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.695
Course 5 there's a bunch of stuff here.

48
00:02:58.695 --> 00:03:00.315
It's multimedia in particular,

49
00:03:00.315 --> 00:03:03.370
a lot about image processing and computer vision.

50
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.460
Some of the concepts we cover have to do with 2D signals.

51
00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.770
Course 4 was mainly time series signals.

52
00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.665
Course 5 deals with 2D signals like images.

53
00:03:13.665 --> 00:03:18.325
We'll talk about sensing 2D signals of thd DragonBoard.

54
00:03:18.325 --> 00:03:24.884
We'll also be using the Arduino GPU and Diggler computer vision also on DragonBoard,

55
00:03:24.884 --> 00:03:28.235
we'll talk about how to use OpenCV

56
00:03:28.235 --> 00:03:32.645
and we'll also touch upon deep learning on DragonBoard using Google TensorFlow.

57
00:03:32.645 --> 00:03:37.860
At a higher level Course 4 is music related,

58
00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.475
Course 5 image computer vision related,

59
00:03:41.475 --> 00:03:46.161
so you can deal with a lot of image processing concepts in Course 5.

60
00:03:46.161 --> 00:03:49.970
Finally, Course 6, Capstone.

61
00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.135
We got two sample Capstones out there for you pretty small Capstones.

62
00:03:54.135 --> 00:03:57.510
You don't of course have to follow what we offer there but it kind of

63
00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.530
gives you the basics of what you learned in four and five in particular.

64
00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.080
Capstone 1 is about sonification of sound.

65
00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:10.980
What it is, is you are in front of a camera and it's kind

66
00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:17.100
of processing an image and you can control qualities of your music using your hands.

67
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.390
You flick, for example,

68
00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:23.720
you can do this to kind of bring the volume up or bend the page,

69
00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.575
and it ties into the MIDI concept you learned in Course 4.

70
00:04:28.575 --> 00:04:30.950
It also ties into the concepts in Course 5,

71
00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.505
how to process images.

72
00:04:33.505 --> 00:04:35.660
That's Capstone 1.

73
00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.885
Capstone 2 is using Cloud processing.

74
00:04:39.885 --> 00:04:43.755
In particular, we are going to use the Amazon IoT SDK.

75
00:04:43.755 --> 00:04:46.650
It's about getting signals from

76
00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.950
various sensors and these signals are flowing to the cloud from

77
00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:53.100
the DragonBoard and you process those signals in

78
00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.715
the cloud and then make some decisions based on that.

79
00:04:57.715 --> 00:05:01.700
While we have chosen is biometrics,

80
00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.920
not biometrics, I should say,

81
00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.010
EKG signals like heartbeats,

82
00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:11.010
other signals which we're not actually collecting

83
00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:16.560
with a real EKG but we have a database of signals stored from real machines.

84
00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:21.170
We're going to stream it from the DragonBoard to the cloud and in

85
00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:26.625
the cloud AWS we're going to process these using readily available SDKs,

86
00:05:26.625 --> 00:05:30.020
which makes inference from these time series signals.

87
00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:33.500
For example, it can analyze your EKG,

88
00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.100
see if you have any existing conditions like bundle branch block

89
00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:41.645
or other kinds of abnormalities and it can give you the results in real time.

90
00:05:41.645 --> 00:05:47.975
So we got two different flavors here so 2 is about using an Amazon IoT SDK.

91
00:05:47.975 --> 00:05:52.520
It kind of fits in if you have projects where you have a lot of sensors,

92
00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.020
data flowing to the server,

93
00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.180
to the cloud, and we use the Amazon IoT SDK.

94
00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:03.020
Capstone 1 has a different take, image processing,

95
00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:11.065
music signal processing, and you can take ideas from these two Capstones and do your own.

96
00:06:11.065 --> 00:06:16.250
We'll release all these to give you ideas about how it's

97
00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:23.000
done and that kind of summarizes all the courses in this specialization. Thank you.
