00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:07.150
You will recall from
an earlier module about

2
00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:13.460
Nyquist Sampling Theorem, there you could
take wise information and digitize it.

3
00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:19.200
And this requires 12 to 14
bits to maintain tall quality.

4
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.216
The graph that you see on
the left hand side shows that for

5
00:00:23.216 --> 00:00:28.868
signals that are very loud in
intensity on the positive side or

6
00:00:28.868 --> 00:00:34.720
the negative side,
instead of a linear scale they use a log

7
00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.750
scale to compress the data and
on the receiver you expand the data.

8
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.740
This is called Compression/Expansion,
or Companding.

9
00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:50.340
And with 8 bits per sample,
instead of 12 to 14 bits per sample,

10
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.310
you could get tall quality voice.

11
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.450
And that requires,

12
00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:01.018
when you're sampling at 8 kilohertz
per sample, at 8 bits per sample.

13
00:01:01.018 --> 00:01:07.790
That's exactly 64 kilobits
per second of data.

14
00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.690
That's for each wise channel.

15
00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.420
A slight difference is between the North
American format and the European format.

16
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.093
When the exponential's on
the large scale they use Mu Law,

17
00:01:21.093 --> 00:01:24.043
in Europe they use A-Law, and

18
00:01:24.043 --> 00:01:29.050
you could have a bunch of
lines using time division.

19
00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.789
On each couple, you could use
time division multiplexing to put

20
00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:37.050
more than 1 wise cog, compared to before.

21
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.706
[COUGH] On the T1 lines
used in North America,

22
00:01:41.706 --> 00:01:46.580
you have 24 wise calls on singular copper.

23
00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.620
In Europe,
they use 32 channels on each line.

24
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.670
And this is essentially how the analog

25
00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.700
wireless calls are transported
in digital format.
