00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:07.120
The other big thing was the call centers.

2
00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:12.060
You could have a group
of people supporting all

3
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:16.800
the traffic that comes to
a specific company, Walmarts,

4
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.740
or Microsoft, and
provide all these services.

5
00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.500
And, this is actually where
a lot of good paying jobs

6
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.600
went from US to other countries.

7
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:36.610
And, this was such a big cultural
thing that politicians talk about it,

8
00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.470
movies were made about this.

9
00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:44.200
This is a movie where a guy from
Seattle had to go to India and

10
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:50.460
train his own replacement and

11
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.440
the other big thing from an inter
price perspective was customer

12
00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:02.410
relationship management software,
there were so many middleware software for

13
00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:07.850
all different aspects of the business that

14
00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.687
was essentially enabled
by this SS7 digital

15
00:01:13.687 --> 00:01:18.400
telephony architecture.

16
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.080
So I don't want to beat the point anymore,
but

17
00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:29.811
just wanted to give this example
of 411 Directory Assistance.

18
00:01:29.811 --> 00:01:35.192
The previous examples were mostly
revenue making businesses,

19
00:01:35.192 --> 00:01:40.074
but 411 is a revenue preserving
business in the sense,

20
00:01:40.074 --> 00:01:45.071
when people call 411 and
wanted directory assistance.

21
00:01:45.071 --> 00:01:52.350
You still had the operators who
were there to manage the lines.

22
00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.638
And one of the things that the SS7

23
00:01:57.638 --> 00:02:02.910
architecture allows you

24
00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:08.270
is when you're still holding the call,
you could actually get the voice,

25
00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.260
the callers voice and
do things like speech recognition, and

26
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.430
a lot of these things for
voice enable services

27
00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:26.990
went on to appear in Siri,
Cortana, okay Google.

28
00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:32.420
So many of other things that we see now.

29
00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.910
And one of the things that's
been really difficult

30
00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:44.220
in all of this is cracking how
voice user interface would work.

31
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.070
For graphical user interface you
have a big screen and very precise

32
00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.800
pointing devices like mouse,
keyboard, touchpad.

33
00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.460
It's not so with voice.

34
00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:04.750
You're limited to only one ear with
the telephone and you're using only voice,

35
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.500
so the research on this still continue and
I think

36
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.930
there will be a lot more research and
new products and services in this area.
