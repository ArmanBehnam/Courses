00:00:02.283 --> 00:00:04.911
Hey, guys.
In this clip we're gonna talk

2
00:00:04.911 --> 00:00:09.371
a little about how you're going
to go about building an IoT,

3
00:00:09.371 --> 00:00:11.569
what kind of things you need.

4
00:00:11.569 --> 00:00:15.262
So let's start off with some scenarios,
some of the ideas you may come up with.

5
00:00:15.262 --> 00:00:19.968
We talked about a sprinkler example
in the previous lesson, the sprinkler

6
00:00:19.968 --> 00:00:24.466
which is smart enough to know when it
rains or when the soil needs water.

7
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:30.870
Or too, maybe a garage door opener,
you may have some pet projects.

8
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:35.406
For example, I leave my garage door,
some nights I forget to close it.

9
00:00:35.406 --> 00:00:39.308
And wake up in the morning I see the door
is still open and there are raccoons and

10
00:00:39.308 --> 00:00:40.950
squirrels in there.

11
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.272
So you may want to come up with
something where between 10 PM to 6 AM,

12
00:00:45.272 --> 00:00:49.840
if it's open beyond a certain amount
of time, it closes automatically.

13
00:00:50.972 --> 00:00:54.249
Or a pet feeder project,
where you may be out of town and

14
00:00:54.249 --> 00:00:58.160
you want a cat to be fed at
a certain time every day.

15
00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.630
Or a surveillance project,
where you are monitoring your house and

16
00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:06.740
if it detects motion take a snapshot,
send it to your phone as an MMS.

17
00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:07.820
These are possibilities.

18
00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.977
Maybe you may have a different idea for
a selfie stick.

19
00:01:10.977 --> 00:01:14.090
You can be a better selfie
queen than Kim Kardashian.

20
00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.080
So you may have all kinds of ideas.

21
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.470
Let's kind of figure out what
do all these things need, right?

22
00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.870
Some sort of a compute platform.

23
00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.530
You need some sort of a small
compute platform which is able to

24
00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.448
receive information either in a wired or
wireless fashion.

25
00:01:30.448 --> 00:01:33.352
And two, being able to act upon it.

26
00:01:33.352 --> 00:01:37.350
For example, maybe drive a motor or
send a wireless signal or

27
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.670
fetch some information from the Internet.

28
00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.710
And if you may need location information,
you may need a GPS receiver.

29
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.130
In addition to that, cost is an issue.

30
00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.490
You don't wanna buy
a separate computer for that.

31
00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.050
You want something small which is
portable, you can move around.

32
00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.200
Optimal in power.

33
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.020
You don't want it to
suck up too much power.

34
00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.035
What else?
And of course, you want it to be cheap.

35
00:02:01.035 --> 00:02:03.280
Add-on components easily available.

36
00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.205
It may not have all of the functionality,
you may buy third-party sensors, for

37
00:02:08.205 --> 00:02:11.690
example, for motion detection or
moisture detection.

38
00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.200
And easily interfaced to these boards,
maybe in a wireless fashion.

39
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.290
And so it should have some sort of
all types of wireless connectivity

40
00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.950
built into it.

41
00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.120
So what are the options?

42
00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.595
There's these kinds of requirements,
and they should support the programming

43
00:02:25.595 --> 00:02:28.160
environment you like to operate
in based on your skill set.

44
00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.945
So the options are, one, microcontrollers.

45
00:02:32.945 --> 00:02:37.350
These are small devices where you
program some logic in the computer.

46
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.850
Burn it, flash it to this thing,
and it does.

47
00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.050
Arduino's one popular board out there.

48
00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.550
Second options are these
single board computers.

49
00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.074
The most popular one you might
have heard of is the Raspberry Pi,

50
00:02:48.074 --> 00:02:53.950
where you can put in Linux on it and
do a bunch of things.

51
00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.451
And third is you can
just use your smartphone.

52
00:02:57.451 --> 00:02:59.654
Do a whole bunch of things.

53
00:02:59.654 --> 00:03:03.599
The only thing which may be lacking in
there is you can not drive external

54
00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:04.200
devices.

55
00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.160
Everything will be most probably
wireless unless you build

56
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.080
some custom hardware to
plug into your phone.

57
00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.340
But you can do a whole bunch
of stuff with your smartphone.

58
00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:22.150
In this course, what we're gonna use is
the Arrow Electronics DragonBoard 410c.

59
00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.300
It's powered by
the Qualcomm Snapdragon processor.

60
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.670
I have one right here.

61
00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.740
The reason we picked this board is
it's actually a new kid on the block.

62
00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:32.990
I shouldn't say new kid,
it's a new dragon on the block.

63
00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.004
It's kind of a Raspberry Pi on steroids.

64
00:03:37.004 --> 00:03:41.610
The reason we like the board is it's
got awesome built-in connectivity.

65
00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.880
It has built in Wi-Fi, Bluetooth,
and it's got even a GPS receiver

66
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.320
with an antenna in it.

67
00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.200
Typically if you buy the Pi,
you'll buy a Wi-Fi dongle and stick it in.

68
00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.640
It's got couple of USB ports and
it's very optimized power consumption.

69
00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.340
So the coolest thing is
it's the same processor

70
00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.100
which drives pretty much every smartphone
which powers this board as well.

71
00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.560
It's the Snapdragon processor.

72
00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.730
So it's very close to the smartphones
you carry in your pocket,

73
00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:14.700
this environment here.

74
00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.218
The minor subtle difference is
that it's optimized for power.

75
00:04:19.218 --> 00:04:23.700
By default it puts out 1.8 volts.

76
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.453
The Pi typically puts out 3.3.

77
00:04:26.453 --> 00:04:32.616
And the pitch on these pins are 2
millimeter and the Pi has 2.54 millimeter.

78
00:04:32.616 --> 00:04:39.558
Other than differences like that,
it's got great connection options.

79
00:04:39.558 --> 00:04:45.375
So this is gonna form the hardware for
this course.

80
00:04:45.375 --> 00:04:47.784
Everything will be tailored
around this board,

81
00:04:47.784 --> 00:04:51.740
so to move along further in subsequent
courses, you do need this board.

82
00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.120
There are instructions
where to buy this board.

83
00:04:55.866 --> 00:04:59.964
This slide I kinda want to show if
you take out your smartphone, open up

84
00:04:59.964 --> 00:05:04.900
the hood, you'd find components which
are very similar to what's in this board.

85
00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.241
So this board by default
comes with Android so

86
00:05:07.241 --> 00:05:11.247
in other words you're comfortable
programming in an Android environment,

87
00:05:11.247 --> 00:05:13.047
this board is right up your alley.

88
00:05:13.047 --> 00:05:14.684
In fact,
you can install Linux in there too.

89
00:05:14.684 --> 00:05:18.813
But so that kind of,
this slide here shows the underlying,

90
00:05:18.813 --> 00:05:23.867
what's in your smart phone,
you'll find components similar to here.

91
00:05:23.867 --> 00:05:28.809
So that kind of summarizes what it's
going to take to built IoT in terms of

92
00:05:28.809 --> 00:05:30.520
hardware and software.

93
00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:31.790
So thank you.
