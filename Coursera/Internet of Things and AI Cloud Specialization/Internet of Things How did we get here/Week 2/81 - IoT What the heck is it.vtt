00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.180
Hey guys, welcome back.

2
00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.290
In this clip, I'm gonna talk about
what the heck IoT is all about.

3
00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.610
You've heard this done so
many times, Internet of Things.

4
00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.280
First, let me start with, what is this
thing in Internet of Things, right?

5
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.670
What is a thing?

6
00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.410
So let's kind of dream up all
of the objects in our house,

7
00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.920
the lowly lawn sprinkler,
the proverbial light bulb.

8
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.440
We can't talk about IoT without
bringing up the light bulb.

9
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:31.820
There'd be a d'Ã©tat.

10
00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:32.770
So I put it in there.

11
00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.100
Maybe your glasses, okay,
your reading glasses.

12
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.910
And a bottle of whiskey, right?

13
00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.409
These are things that are in your house.

14
00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.590
Without any connectivity,
they're kind of plain.

15
00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:49.210
But, let's assume each of these guys
have some sort of connectivity.

16
00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.910
They can kind of transmit a little bit
of data or receive some data or both.

17
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.320
Suddenly, they become interesting.

18
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.770
Let's take an example.

19
00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.740
So in other words,
they have some sort of connectivity.

20
00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.310
I'm not talking about in a full blown IP,
but

21
00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:08.170
they have some forms of short range
communication where they can occasionally

22
00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.060
wake up, say something about
themselves to a neighboring device or

23
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.180
to a server or interact with a human,
all kinds of possibilities.

24
00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.240
They don't need actual power,
they can be battery powered.

25
00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.060
Let's take the sprinkler for example.

26
00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.870
It could be combined with it
could have sensors to measure

27
00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:26.460
the moisture in your soil.

28
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.650
So it can shut itself
off when there's rain.

29
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.360
It only comes on when the soil is
sufficiently dry, the light bulb.

30
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.730
I mean think of landscaping in your yard,
right?

31
00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:44.570
You can now set it to come on at dusk and
and go off when it's sunrise.

32
00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.890
Those things already exist but,
you know, you can push to another level.

33
00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.230
Your reading glasses, right?

34
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:50.840
Think of Google Glasses.

35
00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.220
I'm not gonna say anything more about it.

36
00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.020
I know there are lovers and haters.

37
00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.710
And finally a bottle of whiskey.

38
00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.800
Hey, what can you do
with a bottle of whiskey?

39
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.620
Actually Johnny Walker did some cool
stuff with a bottle of whiskey.

40
00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.530
They made the labels pretty smart.

41
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.530
It has a little antenna in it.

42
00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.080
It can detect number one if
the bottle has been opened or not.

43
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.660
They realize a lot of people when
they are about to purchase a bottle,

44
00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.660
they are researching in their phones,
should I buy a single malt or blended, and

45
00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.840
the research is happening typically
within five feet of the bottle.

46
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.690
And so this smart tack and
interact with your phone.

47
00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.040
It knows I haven't been opened.

48
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.580
There's someone looking at me to buy me.

49
00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:29.810
I haven't been opened yet.

50
00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.330
That's another scenario.

51
00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.000
So determines the state so
it can someway communicate.

52
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.690
And also, and if it's been opened,
it knows that and

53
00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.140
it communicates it to your phone it's like
it knows it's already been bought, so

54
00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.990
interaction would be slightly different.

55
00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.620
It's kind of like I should say
when you're dating someone and

56
00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.540
you get married,
it's different interaction, right?

57
00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.430
You already have someone,
least kind of bottle.

58
00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.430
And also the other cool thing for
Father's Day.

59
00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.800
You can create a customized thing for
your dad, a video message, and

60
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.950
he scans the bottle and he gets to
see what you have planned for him.

61
00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.500
Anyway, bottom line, these things when
they have some Internet connectivity

62
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.480
become Internet of things then
new possibilities emerge.

63
00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.500
Here's data which suggest
from it's not my chart, but

64
00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.580
borrowed from my garder, how these
things are growing, the growth rate.

65
00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.380
If you look at the chart the red is
typically the personal computers,

66
00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:27.980
which are connected to the Internet.

67
00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.650
They kind of flattened out.

68
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.070
Smartphones are growing.

69
00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:33.110
More smartphones, tablets.

70
00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:34.260
But if you look at the one,

71
00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.060
the biggest growth is going to
be in this Internet of Things.

72
00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.890
These dumb things which shouldn't have
connectivity suddenly have connectivity.

73
00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.330
And that's going to be exploding.

74
00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:47.856
They say about roughly 50
billion devices by 2020.

75
00:03:47.856 --> 00:03:49.619
So take it for what it's worth.

76
00:03:49.619 --> 00:03:55.562
The exact numbers may not matter, but the
fact is it's growing at an alarming pace.

77
00:03:55.562 --> 00:04:00.160
Let's get back to what the heck is IoT?

78
00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.930
Let's go back maybe 15 years.

79
00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.900
We had the television.

80
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.100
It was still broadcast,
you are watching what was fed to you.

81
00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.610
TV was not connected to the Internet
until the set up boxes came around.

82
00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.950
When I was growing up India I was
telling my American friend hey man,

83
00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:19.810
we didn't even have a remote control.

84
00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.430
So he was asking what?

85
00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.960
How do you watch?

86
00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:25.240
Did you have a service industry where
someone was changing channels for you?

87
00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.980
I said no man we only one channel.

88
00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.370
We didn't need a remote.

89
00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:34.190
So that's kind of how I grew up,
but now the boxes came around.

90
00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.770
You could now control your TV remotely,
right?

91
00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.740
The smartphones arrived,
the apps were there.

92
00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.500
Now you started watching TV on your phone.

93
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.850
You could also record
shows from your phone.

94
00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:49.660
So in other words,
putting the TV on the net created a new

95
00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.840
kind of interaction between
the smartphone and your TV.

96
00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.550
Let's take one step further right,
what's the next big thing in your house?

97
00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:01.620
The refrigerator, the fridge, and
imagine your fridge being smart.

98
00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.540
In other words can become aware of at any
times what kind of food items in your

99
00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:10.520
fridge, and it can let's say
communicate that to your phone, and

100
00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:14.690
there's a recipe app in your phone, or
an Amazon app in your phone which can tell

101
00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:18.380
you, hey, based on what's in your fridge,
these are the dishes you can make.

102
00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:22.350
And if you don't have it, let's say you
can click order and Amazon certainly,

103
00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:25.880
it can deliver via drones within
30 minutes, once you order.

104
00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.020
So you can have your
thing delivered to you,

105
00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.420
pick up from your drone,
make your dish, right?

106
00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:34.270
I mean, I got to tell you,
when I was a kid I didn't have a fridge or

107
00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:35.240
the Internet of Things.

108
00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.080
But I had good food from my mom.

109
00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.250
But this is, I guess, we call progress,
like a smart fridge, right.

110
00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:43.630
Let's keep going, the thermostat.

111
00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:46.460
You've heard of companies like Nest,
we will acquire,

112
00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:51.089
which can smartly control energy in your
house based on different parameters.

113
00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.405
The smart toilet.

114
00:05:53.405 --> 00:05:55.250
Yeah, believe it or not,
they're making smart toilets.

115
00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.490
You may think like,
put the toilet on the net.

116
00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:59.000
Who gives a shit?

117
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.420
But, no pun intended, but
there are smart toilets.

118
00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:06.530
You can put sensors in the toilet
which can analyze the urine and

119
00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:10.430
detect diseases at an early stage and

120
00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:13.790
that can communicate that to your phone or
your health provider or what not.

121
00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:16.680
But these do toilets to exist.

122
00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.130
I have an idea for
Capstone project, maybe you should

123
00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:24.970
create an ad which changes
itself Friday night at 9 pm.

124
00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:27.590
Because it knows that's the way it's
going to be when you come back from

125
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:28.970
the bars right?

126
00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:31.350
So, let's keep going.

127
00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:33.060
Put your dog on the net.

128
00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.890
Say what the hell, dog you pet on the net.

129
00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:39.680
There was a company called Petcell,
which is making these cellphone collars.

130
00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.890
You can put it on your dog.

131
00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:45.860
When you call the dog it'll automatically
answer and put it on speakerphone,

132
00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:47.590
because he knows you're calling.

133
00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:50.740
You can talk to the dog, it'll hear you
talking, and what's it going to say?

134
00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:52.200
Probably rattle the poor thing.

135
00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.250
But I don't know if
the company is still around,

136
00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:59.390
but that's kind of putting
your pet on the net, and

137
00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:02.320
probably if you get telemarketing calls,
you can direct it to your dog,

138
00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:08.390
maybe one use of it,
next step is fork, a smart fork.

139
00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:11.070
Everyone's trying to lose weight, right?

140
00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:14.010
One thing is your brain,
when you're eating,

141
00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:17.150
tells you five minute later then
when you get actually full.

142
00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:21.390
So by the time you've overshot,
you stuff yourself.

143
00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:25.940
And by the time your brain tells you
you're full, you're beyond full.

144
00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:27.610
You're about to explode.

145
00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:30.850
So one thing is to slow
down the pace you eat.

146
00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:32.665
So you can stop,
right the time you get full.

147
00:07:32.665 --> 00:07:35.996
And this fork, search for happy fork.

148
00:07:35.996 --> 00:07:36.767
Fork.

149
00:07:36.767 --> 00:07:40.274
This company had the idea where
it measures, it has sensors,

150
00:07:40.274 --> 00:07:43.720
how many bites you take and
can vibrate to help you slow down.

151
00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.590
And it's got Bluetooth in there.

152
00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:47.150
It can communicate that to your phone.

153
00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:51.110
At the end of your meal it shows
you how many bites you've taken.

154
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:53.100
Over 200 it says, stop being a pig, and

155
00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:56.050
it can give you feedback
on how you're eating.

156
00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:58.530
So as you can see is wide
of range of products.

157
00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:00.940
And then who knows what is coming next,
right?

158
00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:05.330
Have you heard of Volkswagen beating
the system by shutting down the emissions

159
00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:07.410
when the tests are happening.

160
00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:10.490
So devices are getting smarter and
smarter.

161
00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:13.810
It doesn't matter what the next device is

162
00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:16.040
our goal is to put you
in the middle of it.

163
00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:19.270
Whatever you dream up we want
you to be able to build it and

164
00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:20.690
what are the skills you need for that,

165
00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:25.200
that's what this specialization focuses
on so we're gonna help you get there.

166
