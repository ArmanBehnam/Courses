00:00:04.107 --> 00:00:08.415
How do you manage all your users
in the bands that you have

2
00:00:08.415 --> 00:00:11.890
licensed from the government?

3
00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:17.625
These are called FDMA frequency
division multiple access, TDMA,

4
00:00:17.625 --> 00:00:23.280
time division multiple access, CDMA,
code division multiple access.

5
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.970
Don't worry about the acronyms now,
we will get

6
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.565
a big idea of what exactly
they all correspond to.

7
00:00:31.565 --> 00:00:36.660
[COUGH] The first
generation of cell phones,

8
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.100
one key, they are call AMPS.

9
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.900
Advanced mobile phone system.

10
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:48.120
And it was based on Frequency
division multiple axis.

11
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:56.420
So, you have a separate radio station
banned for each of the users, and

12
00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:03.060
through the duration of the call
each user occupies a given spectrum.

13
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.350
And this is why it's quite similar
to circular switched telephoning.

14
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.500
Now you occupy a spectral
band instead of a copper.

15
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.500
In North America, each of these
channels were 30 kilovolts wide, and

16
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:24.720
that gives you about 54 users,
54 channels in a bay station so

17
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.620
that one user is not interfering
with the other user.

18
00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:36.420
So I want you to recall the FM
broadcast system we did in Module 1.

19
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:44.720
The FM went from 88 megahertz to 108
megahertz with 200 kilohertz per station.

20
00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.630
So you have about 100 FM radio stations.

21
00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.436
In AMPS, each voice signal is
carried exactly like in FM.

22
00:01:54.436 --> 00:02:00.000
And you have 4 kilohertz for
each voice signal that

23
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.168
when you do frequency modulation,
there is bandwidth expansion.

24
00:02:04.168 --> 00:02:09.050
And that takes about 30
kilohertz to give tall quality.

25
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:16.430
The main point is the link between
the cell phone and the bay station

26
00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:22.340
is still analogue, although the rest of
the telephone network is all digital,

27
00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:29.351
and that's why this is sometimes
called the analog form.

28
00:02:29.351 --> 00:02:35.200
In 2G,
the modulation schemes went digital.

29
00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.980
So, we still have each channel for
one user, but

30
00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.750
instead of giving it to one user.

31
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:48.940
Here on the left one they're showing all
the three users squeezed into one channel.

32
00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:56.620
So, in the digital scheme the three users
all use the time in a round robin manner.

33
00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.080
So, first one third user one users then
the second user, then the third user.

34
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.959
And in the next second,
it comes back to the first user.

35
00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:12.420
And this is quite similar to the T1,

36
00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.310
E1 trunk lines that we talked
about in the digital telephony.

37
00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:23.980
That is also a tedium, a time division,
multiple axis in the digital telephony.
