00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:09.000
So, the other networks that we
saw were broadcast networks.

2
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.780
Here, the information from the sender
is sent to multiple users.

3
00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:23.030
In the context of wireless broadcast
networks, the main lesson is,

4
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:30.850
you can have a very power hungry
encoder like a tower with wall power,

5
00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:37.440
but you want your receivers to be
ultra low power with mobility.

6
00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.707
Because you're covering lots of users.
