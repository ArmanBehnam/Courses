00:00:02.897 --> 00:00:07.878
At this point,
I would like to take a little bit of time

2
00:00:07.878 --> 00:00:12.198
to recap all the different
types of networks,

3
00:00:12.198 --> 00:00:17.111
especially in the context
of making them wireless.

4
00:00:17.111 --> 00:00:21.844
The telephony is good for one-to-one.

5
00:00:21.844 --> 00:00:26.203
The Broadcast, one sender,
multiple receivers.

6
00:00:26.203 --> 00:00:31.585
And the new one we will talk
about is the sensor networks

7
00:00:31.585 --> 00:00:37.682
where multiple sensors
are sending data to one gateway.

8
00:00:37.682 --> 00:00:43.840
And how all of these convergences

9
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:50.210
have led to the internet of things and the
IoT platform that we are going to discuss.
