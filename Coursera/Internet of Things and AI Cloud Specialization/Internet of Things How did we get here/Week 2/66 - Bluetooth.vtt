00:00:02.912 --> 00:00:07.129
The Bluetooth radio was
originally developed for

00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:11.510
hands-free use of cell
phones with a headset.

3
00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:16.640
In fact, it started even before
the smart phones became popular.

4
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:22.390
And now it has found so many other uses
in fitness, wellness applications,

5
00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.660
pretty much every car comes
with Bluetooth-equipped,

6
00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.880
the iPods, the computer keypads,
and the mouse.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.846
Then, one of the newer
releases of Bluetooth,

8
00:00:35.846 --> 00:00:40.980
Bluetooth 4.2, has Bluetooth low energy.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.581
And this is finding in patient
to heart rate monitors,

10
00:00:45.581 --> 00:00:49.492
the Garmin, the Fitbits,
so on and so forth.
