1
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:09.480
So, in the previous modules, in module
one, we briefly discussed, explained SS7.

2
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.125
That's signaling system seven,
which is a rich,

3
00:00:13.125 --> 00:00:19.090
out-of-band signalling protocol
that is the data plane and

4
00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.400
the control plane are on
different streams.

5
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.204
This was a very very
powerful architecture and

6
00:00:27.204 --> 00:00:31.870
AT&T wanted to leverage the system
to increase their revenues.

7
00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:36.310
Of course.
For the carriers, in those days,

8
00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:41.350
and even now,
if you're getting $40 per subscriber,

9
00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.180
per month, that is really good business.

10
00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.450
And any features that you add
on top of that, they were gravy.

11
00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:57.500
So AT&T sends out a big memo to all
the engineers to come up with ideas.

12
00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:03.884
And there was this engineer,
Roy Weber, go goes sees manager and

13
00:01:03.884 --> 00:01:08.930
tells him his idea of
scaling collect calling.

14
00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.820
Collect calling is
[COUGH] you don't pay for

15
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.870
the call, the receiving party
actually foots the bill.

16
00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.650
And he wanted to scale this for
businesses so

17
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.660
that when customers call, they don't foot
the bill, the business foots the bill.

18
00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.020
And his manager said,

19
00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.412
Roy, that's a pretty dumb idea,
go back to work on something else.

20
00:01:31.412 --> 00:01:34.840
And Mr. Weber listened to his manager and

21
00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:41.270
promptly went on to work on his idea,
which turned out to be the 1-800 system.

22
00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.040
So this is how it will actually work.

23
00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:53.512
There is a big database that is
connected with SS7 links off the switch.

24
00:01:53.512 --> 00:01:57.940
And in this switch,
they have given away all

25
00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.970
these 1 800 numbers for
different categories, right?

26
00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.720
And the database actually
has the translation

27
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.980
between this fictitious 1-800 numbers and
some physical numbers.

28
00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:18.200
So in this case,
Bob wants to find a dentist.

29
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.460
So he calls 1-800-Dentist.

30
00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:28.030
And the switch looks at the 800 number and
takes Bob's area code,

31
00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.930
555 and goes to this SS7 database and

32
00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:41.369
in the database it looks at the area
code and the 800 dentist combination.

33
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:48.330
Finds a physical number
that belongs to a dentist,

34
00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.010
and it comes up with Sheldon,
who is a dentist.

35
00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.950
And it gives that number to the switch.

36
00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.830
The switch then calls Sheldon to see
if he's willing to pick up the call.

37
00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:06.867
As soon as Sheldon picks up the phone,it
will establish a data line between Bob and

38
00:03:06.867 --> 00:03:10.290
Sheldon so
they can continue the discussion.

39
00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:17.160
All of this happens between
three to five rings of

40
00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:23.430
Bob calling the phone and
It became such a huge success,

41
00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:29.200
it was essentially 40% of
all long distance traffic.

42
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.743
And the impact on businesses was so
huge that they ran out of 800 numbers.

43
00:03:34.743 --> 00:03:38.535
They had to invent 888, 877, 855.

44
00:03:38.535 --> 00:03:43.960
You can do the math of how big it was for
AT&T.

45
00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.944
Til FCC broke up AT&T in 1984.

46
00:03:47.944 --> 00:03:56.440
AT&T actually owned all the numbers
including the 800 numbers so

47
00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:02.630
this was a good cash gravy and
AT&T went on to try bunch of other things.

48
00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:07.940
These are the things that were
leveraging the similar architecture.

49
00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.470
For each of these services,
there would be ten dollars to set up

50
00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:17.390
the service and four dollars per month for
each of the features.

51
00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:21.342
So, if you missed a call,
you could dial *69 and

52
00:04:21.342 --> 00:04:24.700
you will be connected to
the person who just called you.

53
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.831
The switch just remembers who just
called and the call wasn't completed.

54
00:04:29.831 --> 00:04:35.050
*66 is, if the other side is busy,
it keeps on calling that person for

55
00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:41.128
about 30 minutes and call you back
immediately when that line gets free.

56
00:04:41.128 --> 00:04:48.218
And *60, you can have your phone
number ignored for up to ten numbers.

57
00:04:48.218 --> 00:04:54.700
Maybe your in-laws calling you and you
don't want to even have your phone ring.

58
00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.910
Surprisingly, at last, some of these ideas
were bringing lots of additional revenues.

59
00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.810
And some of them never really took off and

60
00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:07.090
don't even exist in
the presence of cellphones.

61
00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.580
But I just wanted to give
you an idea of things that,

62
00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.790
features that people were thinking of.

63
00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:18.150
This particular architecture
was actually leveraged for

64
00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.248
many over services that
are currently in operation.

65
00:05:22.248 --> 00:05:24.078
Number portability,

66
00:05:24.078 --> 00:05:29.110
location-based services, in fact,
some of the basic wireless

67
00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:35.510
networking protocols are based
on these ideas of SS7 signaling.
