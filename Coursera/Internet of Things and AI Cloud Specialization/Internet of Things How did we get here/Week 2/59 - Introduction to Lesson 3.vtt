00:00:03.048 --> 00:00:06.919
In 1985, there were 350,000,

2
00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:11.116
give or take,
cellular subscribers in the US.

3
00:00:11.116 --> 00:00:18.280
Today, there are 6.8 billion
subscribers worldwide.

4
00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.500
So you can see that it was very,

5
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.040
very important to increase
the capacity of the system.

6
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.457
How do you increase the capacity?

7
00:00:27.457 --> 00:00:33.978
In this lesson, we will look at how
some of these were accomplished.

8
00:00:33.978 --> 00:00:39.958
So this is the story of getting
more spectrum and doing more vid,

9
00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:44.946
specifically increasing
the spectral efficiency,

10
00:00:44.946 --> 00:00:50.594
reducing the data rate that you need for
each voice call, and

11
00:00:50.594 --> 00:00:56.050
some of the concepts that led
to the 3G and 4G evolution.
