00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:07.105
The next thing that needed to
happen was on the Control Plane

2
00:00:07.105 --> 00:00:12.227
in connecting different
elements on the network,

3
00:00:12.227 --> 00:00:18.420
the callers to the called party,
and before it went digital,

4
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.018
the control information was
all in the analog domain and

5
00:00:24.018 --> 00:00:26.899
it was in-band signaling.

6
00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:32.178
That is,
they would use dual tone frequencies,

7
00:00:32.178 --> 00:00:40.435
like for number five it would be
a combination of 770 Hz plus 1336 Hz.

8
00:00:40.435 --> 00:00:43.952
And this is how switches
could talk to each other,

9
00:00:43.952 --> 00:00:47.818
at the most,
10 characters at 30 bits per second.

10
00:00:51.255 --> 00:00:56.644
When it went digital, the protocol was

11
00:00:56.644 --> 00:01:02.379
signaling system seven, or short SS7.

12
00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:05.570
So what the diagram is showing here is

13
00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.930
PSTN is
the Public Switched Telephony Network, and

14
00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.810
all these devices that are connected
to it are on the control plane.

15
00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.080
I'm not showing the data plane
in this particular picture.

16
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.310
SSP is a service switching point.

17
00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:30.310
That is where a telephone or a fax
machine would connect to this network.

18
00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:37.240
And SCP is a service control point
where you could connect the computer or

19
00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.870
a database to do more
advanced intelligent things.

20
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:47.260
The other name for this network
was advanced intelligent network.

21
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.540
The keypoint that I wanted to
stress on here is the STP,

22
00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.720
which is the Signal Transfer Point.

23
00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:03.220
This is just like a router on the Internet
in the second module that we saw.

24
00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:10.456
They always came in pairs to
increase the reliability in

25
00:02:10.456 --> 00:02:15.569
the telephony network.

26
00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:20.120
And the main thing that I want to

27
00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:29.320
take away from here is the SS7 is
a completely packet switched network.

28
00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:36.410
And it had about 2,000
bytes of payload for

29
00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:43.660
each of the messages, each control plane
would take 64 kilobits per second channel.

30
00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.633
And using this you could do call set up,

31
00:02:48.633 --> 00:02:52.563
call tear down, and billing.

32
00:02:52.563 --> 00:02:58.188
And with the computers and
data bases attached to it,

33
00:02:58.188 --> 00:03:05.949
it could do a lot more clever things
than was possible in the analog world.
