00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:07.560
There have been some hiccups, and
the most notable one was last year,

2
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.640
April 4, 2014, there were 11
million people in Washington,

3
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:20.430
Oregon, California, Illinois,
that could not make 911 calls.

4
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.776
They were just getting a busy tone.

5
00:00:23.776 --> 00:00:30.040
And it took FCC a year to do the audit,
and

6
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:37.540
they reported August 2015 that it was just
a simple, very simple software glitch.

7
00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.390
It was a hard-coded number.

8
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.250
Once the switch which
certain number of calls,

9
00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.020
they're just getting dropped on the floor.

10
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.020
The surprising thing was it
took almost six hours to find

11
00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:57.720
the switches where this was happening and
remedy the thing.

12
00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:04.840
And for emergency services,
their people rely on this very, very much.

13
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:13.110
It was a very big blow for the operators
and the companies that they outsource,

14
00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.150
managing the 911 system.
