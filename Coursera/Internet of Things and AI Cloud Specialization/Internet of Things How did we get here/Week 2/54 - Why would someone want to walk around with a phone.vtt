00:00:04.883 --> 00:00:09.800
Why would one want to walk
around with a telephone?

2
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.350
We have all known about cordless
phones and how useful they are.

3
00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:18.190
You can walk around in the house
while you're on the phone.

4
00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.480
The phones work in unlicensed
bands called ISM bands.

5
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.950
ISM stands for Industrial, Scientific and
Medical bands that the FCC

6
00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:36.970
recently opened up back in 1985 or
86 for people to use.

7
00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.330
And it's the same banks that you can
use for cordless phones, garages,

8
00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.380
science experiments, so on and so forth.

9
00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.620
So the base unit that you see,
plugs into the telephone network, and

10
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.820
the handheld has a battery and

11
00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.870
talks to the base unit let's say,
in 49 megahertz bank.

12
00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.600
And the base unit does
all the call processing.

13
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.990
And as the cordless phones got popular and
the neighborhood was getting really

14
00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:12.050
crowded, you could hear your neighbor's
conversations, new devices started coming

15
00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.642
in, and 900 megahertz band,
just to keep up with the demand.

16
00:01:16.642 --> 00:01:21.200
Now, think of the base unit of

17
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.050
your own cordless phone hanging
off a tower via your phone.

18
00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:33.370
And now imagine multiple
such base units in your city

19
00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.210
arranged in a honeycomb on the right side.

20
00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:42.160
So when you are home, you connect to one
of the base stations, let's say BS1.

21
00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.500
And when you go to Bob's house,
maybe you'll connect to BS19.

22
00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.370
So, as you leave your home,
or drive around in the city.

23
00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.170
You actually get to take
your phone with you, and

24
00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.020
it will continuously connect to one or
the other base stations,

25
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.390
and you could make a call and
you could receive a call.

26
00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.010
This was very, very compelling.

27
00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:12.180
People could call you any time without
getting your answering machine.

28
00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.650
And you don't have to hunt for
a payphone in order to call someone.
