00:00:04.132 --> 00:00:08.727
Starting with the 3G services and
3G phones and

2
00:00:08.727 --> 00:00:13.324
smart phones,
we see lots of other radios beyond

3
00:00:13.324 --> 00:00:18.770
the cellular radio used for
wide area networking.

4
00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.940
Getting it to the phones.

5
00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:29.850
And all of these radios mostly
operate in the unlicensed,

6
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:35.330
ISM band, Industry of Scientific and
Medical bands.

7
00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:40.480
And they're more for
near field communications.

8
00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.420
If you just want to connect
your access point or

9
00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.370
your headset and some other sensors.

10
00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:54.980
So we will briefly look at
some of these in this lesson.

11
00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.635
We do not have anything planned
to go deeper in future courses.

12
00:00:59.635 --> 00:01:04.997
But maybe depending on the interest,
we may have an additional

13
00:01:04.997 --> 00:01:10.259
course in this specialization,
focusing mostly on the other

14
00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:15.440
radios that are there on the smart phone,
tablet platform.
