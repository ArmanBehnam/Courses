00:00:03.575 --> 00:00:05.910
Internet of Things in Smart Homes.

2
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.550
What is a smart home?

3
00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:08.420
At least when I was growing up,

4
00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.210
you're considered smart if you owned
a home, but increasingly homes are getting

5
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.170
networked these days with
all kinds of smart devices.

6
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.340
So, you have your house and
let's look at devices in your house.

7
00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.400
You're trying to minimize the bills
you pay for heating, electricity.

8
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.540
You want your home to be safe, at the same
time you want all the convenience like

9
00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.170
delivery connected to some sort of
grocery store, things like that.

10
00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.790
So let's start with
the humble thermostat right?

11
00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.900
Typically you set it to some temperature,
forget about it, it does this bang,

12
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:41.590
bang control.

13
00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:47.769
If it's below it, it heats it up,
if it's below or wants it up, whatever.

14
00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:50.487
One of the devices, of course,
the light bulb, right,

15
00:00:50.487 --> 00:00:51.978
I have to bring the light bulb.

16
00:00:51.978 --> 00:00:57.960
Smart lighting, if dawn dusk turn
off on for landscape, et cetera.

17
00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:00.410
The fridge.

18
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.230
Right now you sit in front of your TV,

19
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.820
in fact I have to now delete
the recordings in my TV.

20
00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.570
It's much easier to do
it via my phone because

21
00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.790
that interface to the TV remote is so
clunky.

22
00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.443
So I pull up my app on my phone,
select, and boom, deleted.

23
00:01:17.443 --> 00:01:20.946
So you're not going to be very far from
the future where you're gonna be sitting

24
00:01:20.946 --> 00:01:24.310
on your phone looking at all
the contents of your fridge.

25
00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.480
Hey, I got milk, I got butter, and

26
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.750
if you're obsessed with that like
I'm obsessed with my six pack.

27
00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.310
I'm not talking about my abs,
but the six pack in the fridge.

28
00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:34.730
I want to make sure I got enough there.

29
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.490
Tied to some delivery service,

30
00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.670
Amazon or when you run short,
tie it to a recipe app.

31
00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:49.130
So the fridge is being attacked, so you
don't have to run to the grocery store.

32
00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.790
Come on, think about it.

33
00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.690
The goal is to make us as
lazy as possible, right?

34
00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.330
We never have to leave the couch,
so we can keep watching TV.

35
00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.020
We don't have to do all this mundane
stuff, should be taken care of by drones.

36
00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.840
What's next?

37
00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.280
Surveillance.

38
00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.280
This is important, too.

39
00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.340
You have a little kid,
you got some nanny taking care of it,

40
00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:14.470
you want to remotely watch how your
nanny's performing, or you got

41
00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.910
your teen kids alone and you're wondering,
hey, what the hell are they doing now?

42
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.340
You wanna tune in to
see what they're doing.

43
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.090
So surveillance and also,
nothing is stolen, that's a draw.

44
00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.180
That's an important thing.

45
00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.380
And central to all of this is going
to be a phone or mobile platform.

46
00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.590
All this, you're going to access
these services through your phone.

47
00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.550
Being able to view videos,
what's my temperature at,

48
00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:42.390
or what's in my fridge, or am I going
to control these lights from my phone.

49
00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.110
It's kinda going to become
your remote control to all

50
00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.960
the devices you track with your life.

51
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.913
So, before I move further,
I want to show you this little video

52
00:02:52.913 --> 00:02:58.239
before I talk about a thermostat
example where they control the temp

53
00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:03.192
of the glass through a voltage,
so it can go from transparent to

54
00:03:03.192 --> 00:03:08.580
semitransparent or
opaque through a voltage applied to them.

55
00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:16.782
So watch this little video,

56
00:03:16.782 --> 00:03:21.908
it's a short 20

57
00:03:21.908 --> 00:03:27.034
second clip, and

58
00:03:27.034 --> 00:03:32.502
then we'll see you

59
00:03:32.502 --> 00:03:37.988
in the next slide.

60
00:05:12.611 --> 00:05:14.420
So that was pretty cool, right?

61
00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:18.930
How you can control the glass
tint through a voltage.

62
00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.830
Now let's come back to our house example.

63
00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.740
You have your thermostat, it's no longer
a dumb thermostat, this is very smart,

64
00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.400
it can control various
things in your house.

65
00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:33.010
And imagine this thermostat knows
the sun pattern in your house.

66
00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:39.320
The sun goes, the path it takes and what
time of the day which windows are exposed.

67
00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:43.560
And this thermostat can electronically
tint your windows based on

68
00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.470
time of the day, you don't have to do
anything, so your house doesn't cook.

69
00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:52.167
Typically if you have lots of glass
windows facing toward southwest,

70
00:05:52.167 --> 00:05:55.290
you know your house tends to heat up.

71
00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:56.640
So, that is one example.

72
00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.500
These can be programmed and
you can in fact do it remotely,

73
00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:04.220
too with your phone, you can have
access to tinting your window and

74
00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:07.270
your imagination is the limit
what you can do with it.

75
00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.490
And let's keep going here.

76
00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:10.890
The weather right?

77
00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:16.320
Your thermostat will become aware of your
weather prediction for the next week and

78
00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:19.550
if it gets a little humid it can take
in the air conditioner to bring down

79
00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:26.180
the humidity or if you go to bed it
can turn down the temperature so

80
00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:30.820
all these are programmable
through this thermostat.

81
00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:35.430
By the way, there are companies doing
it on commercial scale already, so

82
00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:38.320
these are not like some fancy concepts.

83
00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:41.440
Maybe a thermostats wear off your
calendar, your vacation calendar.

84
00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:45.920
Let's say you come back from vacation,
your plane hits, lands, and you're turned

85
00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:50.460
off, or turned down your water heater
because it's in vacation mode.

86
00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:53.090
And when, by the time you get
home you want it to be hot.

87
00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:56.070
And the thermostat kicks it up,
oh, like line six 30.

88
00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:59.270
Kick it up, and you can do those things.

89
00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:03.680
And here again, the center to
all this is going to be a phone.

90
00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:07.020
You can control remotely,
monitor all this through your phone.

91
00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:12.610
All it requires is remote IP access so
you're thermostat will have an IP address.

92
00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.840
You can remotely monitor
events control events.

93
00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:20.197
Our next example we're going to talk
about in smart home is surveillance.

94
00:07:20.197 --> 00:07:23.312
This is very popular these days.

95
00:07:23.312 --> 00:07:29.160
People are asking demanding remotely able
to monitor the homes what's going on.

96
00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:32.610
So popular examples is motion detection.

97
00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:36.300
You go on vacation you want to make sure
there's no one in the house if you sense

98
00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:38.730
a movement you want to be alerted.

99
00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:45.850
Or if some windows are being opened when
it's shut you want to get notification.

100
00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:51.560
This is typically how the current dumb,
monitoring systems work.

101
00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:56.870
Then they, hear a doorbell ring ding dong.

102
00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:58.560
You wonder who's there.

103
00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:02.030
And I was recently came
across this company's doing

104
00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:05.680
if someone rings your doorbell,
you'll hear it on your phone.

105
00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:07.488
You'll hear someone ringing
your doorbell on your phone.

106
00:08:07.488 --> 00:08:11.940
And you can,it seems a lot of the thefts
don't happen mostly at night.

107
00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:14.390
But someone tries to ring your doorbell
and they think that no one's home.

108
00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:15.680
Let's go in there.

109
00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:18.290
So this one alerts you on your phone,
your doorbell rings, and

110
00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:19.800
then you can talk to that person.

111
00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.710
It doesn't matter if you're home or
somewhere else.

112
00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:24.110
You start answering it, who's there.

113
00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:28.430
You can be vacationing in Hawaii and
someone's ringing your doorbell in Idaho.

114
00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:31.530
You can pretend somebody's home, and they
hear it through the speaker in the front.

115
00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:36.410
I always cringe when my doorbell rings and

116
00:08:36.410 --> 00:08:40.370
wonder if its one of those people come
to tell me like how my religion is bad.

117
00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:42.980
I should convert to what
they tell me is good.

118
00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:47.250
And that's when I want to kind of hit
a button, like a switch on the phone.

119
00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:50.380
The bottom opens,
they fall into a shark tank.

120
00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:56.660
So you can come up with your own creative
surveillance video, I mean applications.

121
00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:59.840
Once again,
needless to say your phone is key.

122
00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:01.690
Your phone is going to
be central to all this.

123
00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:05.579
You want access to all this
surveillance concepts.

124
00:09:05.579 --> 00:09:10.257
And I'm hoping in this course you can
build some cool surveillance capstone

125
00:09:10.257 --> 00:09:11.350
projects.

126
00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:15.250
In fact, we're going to demonstrate
how to use the ultrasonic sensor,

127
00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:16.750
motion detector.

128
00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:20.110
And it's not going to be difficult to
put something together where you can

129
00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:24.050
do some motion, take some photos
that sends it to you as an MMS.

130
00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:28.030
So I hope you come up with some creative,
cool applications we can showcase.

131
00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:29.510
That's Smart Homes.

132
00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:31.520
See you in Automotive next.
