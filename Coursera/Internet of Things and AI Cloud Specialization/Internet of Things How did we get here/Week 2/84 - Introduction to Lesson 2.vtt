1
00:00:04.129 --> 00:00:06.710
The future of Internet of Things.

2
00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.600
The Internet of things permeates
pretty much every domain,

3
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.900
but I'm gonna talk about three
interesting domains here, and

4
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.690
see how the Internet of Things
is shaping these domains.

5
00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:23.380
One of those three, it's gonna be
mobile health, mhealth for short.

6
00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.000
It's about how these fitness devices,
phones and smart watches are helping you

7
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.300
achieve your fitness goals, and
also lead a healthier lifestyle.

8
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.680
Number two is smart homes.

9
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.360
How a smart energy monitor reduces your
cost of energy bills in your house.

10
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.760
Also surveillance, things like that.

11
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.980
Number 3, we all love cars.

12
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.820
How IoT is shaping the auto industry.

13
00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.830
And in all these domains,
pretty much any domain you talk about,

14
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.350
you're gonna see this common theme.

15
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.010
What is that theme,
is there is this thing.

16
00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.490
It may, or may not,
have direct Internet connection.

17
00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:02.170
Let's say it does have an Internet
connection all the time.

18
00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:03.960
Could be an IP connection.

19
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.150
Or it has some short range
wireless connection,

20
00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.221
something like Bluetooth,
Zigbee and things like that.

21
00:01:10.221 --> 00:01:13.610
In such a scenario,
it can talk via phone or

22
00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.290
mobile platform and
occasionally exchange data.

23
00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.780
So these are the two scenarios, and for

24
00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.620
example this thing could be your
[INAUDIBLE] which is always connected.

25
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.300
Or it could be a lawn sprinkler
which comes on briefly and

26
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.100
sends some information.

27
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.970
So we gonna cover that in these lessons,
these three domains.
