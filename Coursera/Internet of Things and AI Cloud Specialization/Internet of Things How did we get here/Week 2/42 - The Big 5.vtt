00:00:04.467 --> 00:00:12.710
In the 70s and 80s there were only
a handful of telephone switch makers.

2
00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:18.810
This was the most expensive piece
of the telephone infrastructure.

3
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.185
And there was Nortel, Siemens, Ericsson,

4
00:00:23.185 --> 00:00:30.170
AT&T Bell Labs which
spawned off Lucent and NTT.

5
00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:35.470
And these switches had become
like massive mainframe computers.

6
00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:41.869
They were massive mainframe computers
with millions and millions of code.

7
00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:46.530
So, to enable a new
revenue bearing service,

8
00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.050
like collect calls, or 1-800 services,

9
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.560
it would take two to three years and
multi-million dollars of effort

10
00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:02.610
to bring in the new feature and
try it out.

11
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:08.090
And what we will see is,
with the advent of SS7, you

12
00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.600
could accomplish the same
thing with small computers,

13
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.220
hanging of the telephony network and
providing exactly the same features.
