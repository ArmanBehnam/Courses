00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.790
the telephones had to go digital.

3
00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:12.610
And there are two aspects here.

4
00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:19.020
One of them is the data plane and
the other one is the control plane.

5
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.661
So we will look at how both of
them went from analog domain into

6
00:00:23.661 --> 00:00:25.310
the digital domain.
