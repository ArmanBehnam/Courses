00:00:04.365 --> 00:00:09.018
The other network that is enabled
by the wireless Internet,

2
00:00:09.018 --> 00:00:14.510
is the sensors network, and
we haven't touched much upon this.

3
00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.990
This is where you have
the wireless sensor,

4
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:25.030
multiple sensors sending to one gateway or
receiver.

5
00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:31.200
This is exactly the opposite of
a broadcast network, where now the sender,

6
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:38.070
the transmitter has to be much lower
power compared to the receivers.

7
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.040
The receivers can be lot more complex,
and this is actually

8
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.410
the internet of the things the future
that most of you will be working on.
