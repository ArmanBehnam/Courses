Interactive voice response technology,
IVR,

2
00:00:08.366 --> 00:00:15.840
it lets you traverse a menu of options
using your voice and voice recognition.

3
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.280
This works great for
simple menu structures, and

4
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:24.508
when it's not working well, the system
knows and hands it off to an agent.

5
00:00:24.508 --> 00:00:29.819
And another capability of all
of this is the information

6
00:00:29.819 --> 00:00:34.113
you would normally
access using a computer,

7
00:00:34.113 --> 00:00:40.880
now you can access it when you are mobile,
just using your phone.

8
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:46.350
You can have your emails read,
your voicemails played back, or

9
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.190
even some of the financial records
like data that's on the computer.

10
00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:59.372
These were the capabilities
enabled by these technologies.
