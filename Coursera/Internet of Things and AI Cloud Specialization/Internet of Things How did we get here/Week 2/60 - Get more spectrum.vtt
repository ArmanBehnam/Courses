00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:08.000
One way to improve the capacity [COUGH]
is obviously to get more spectrum.

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.090
As the demand for cellular telephones
was growing like a [COUGH] hockey stick,

3
00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.450
FCC, Federal Communications Commission
in US, ITU,

4
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:23.490
the International Telecommunications
Union, and other national bodies were

5
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.770
avoiding more and
more spectrum for these services.

6
00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:39.210
And so initially they started with
the 1G services in 800 MHz band and for

7
00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.100
2G services there was another
their 120 MHz allocated and

8
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.283
additional 95MHz for 3G services and

9
00:00:50.283 --> 00:00:55.274
the 4G and the 2.5 gigaherts band.

10
00:00:55.274 --> 00:01:01.040
And as they deploy more and
more services they could put

11
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:08.990
a 3G service in what they were
originally using for 1G services.

12
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.840
So in the licensed banks,

13
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.400
the FCC allocates the spectrum
to the operators.

14
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.860
They get to control how
the spectrum is allocated to

15
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.220
each user In the system
as they are making calls.

16
00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:37.430
This improves the spectral
efficiency significantly better.

17
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.710
And the spectrum actually
below 1,000 megahertz

18
00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:48.645
is considered the beach front property
because of its propagation properties.

19
00:01:48.645 --> 00:01:53.170
They penetrate through buildings and
obstacles much much better.

20
00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.720
So you get much better coverage
in densely populated areas.

21
00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.860
So the industry continues to look for
spectrum and

22
00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.610
repurpose their usage for cell phones.

23
00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.120
For instance,
the 700 megahertz bank that was used for

24
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.273
Analog TV before know people
are looking at how to leverage that for

25
00:02:16.273 --> 00:02:19.970
advanced services,
voice and data services.
