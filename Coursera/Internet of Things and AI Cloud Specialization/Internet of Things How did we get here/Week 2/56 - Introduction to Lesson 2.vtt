00:00:04.466 --> 00:00:09.556
People always talking about the data
plane and the control plane, and

2
00:00:09.556 --> 00:00:14.730
in this lesson we will look at the control
plane in the wireless wire line

3
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:21.049
telephony network, how it was leveraged to
build mobility in the cellular networks.

4
00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.590
As you may recall, we talked about SS7,
signaling system 7,

5
00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.000
in the previous module,
computer telephony integration.

6
00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:40.146
We will see in this lesson how the same
fabric is now used to build mobility.

7
00:00:40.146 --> 00:00:45.290
And Prepaid cellular was
a significant factor

8
00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.390
in the growth of cellular
in developing countries.

9
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.330
Well, SS7 comes to play here, too, and

10
00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:58.221
you could leverage the same fabric very
easily to build pre-paid services,

11
00:00:58.221 --> 00:01:01.656
post-pay services, billing.
