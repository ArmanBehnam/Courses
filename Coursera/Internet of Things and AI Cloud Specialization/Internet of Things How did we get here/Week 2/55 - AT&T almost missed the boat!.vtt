00:00:03.108 --> 00:00:08.269
The engineers and
scientists at AT&T are credited with

2
00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:14.830
most of the concepts that came that
made the cell phones possible.

3
00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.410
And engineers at Motorola
are credited with

4
00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.384
making the first cell
phone call back in 1973.

5
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:32.050
And in 1973, there was this nice movie,
Play it Again, Sam, a Woody Allen movie.

6
00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.900
One of the characters, Dick,
is a workaholic businessman dealing in

7
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.480
real estate and
he's played by Tony Roberts.

8
00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.530
Each time he appears in a scene, he calls
his office to give them the telephone

9
00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:52.096
number where he can be reached, for how
long, and then the next contact number.

10
00:00:52.096 --> 00:00:57.930
So the point is the concept

11
00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.362
of being able to talk to anyone at anytime
and people being able to reach you,

12
00:01:03.362 --> 00:01:08.430
it met a real unmet need and

13
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.130
the mobile phone would
actually solve this problem.

14
00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:18.520
So AT&T commissioned a big consultancy
company, McKinsey and Company,

15
00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:24.970
to forecast how many cell phones
would be in usage by 2000.

16
00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.590
So they did all their number crunching and
came back with the answer 900,000.

17
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:36.810
The real number of subscribers in
the year 2000 was 109 million in

18
00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.460
US, and by that time there were
one billion cell phones worldwide.

19
00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:48.240
And by that time there were actually
more cell phones than landlines.

20
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.190
So, McKinsey missed to connect the dots

21
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:58.420
between the science fiction predictions,
Star Trek communicator,

22
00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.830
the articles by Arthur C Clarke, Isaac
Asimov actually predicted the complete

23
00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.956
use of tablet as we see,
back in 1954 in the Foundation series.

24
00:02:08.956 --> 00:02:14.250
So McKinsey missed to connect the science
fiction with the engineering reality,

25
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:21.680
particularly where the processing
power doubles every 18 months.

26
00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.000
So, AT&T got out of cellular
business based on McKinsey's advice,

27
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.800
but lots of other people
jumped on the bandwagon.

28
00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:38.555
This mistake cost AT&T $12 billion,
because in 1994 thre was a very successful

29
00:02:38.555 --> 00:02:44.590
analog cellular phone company called McCaw
cellular, they went and bought them.

30
00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:51.300
So, the point I'm trying to convey
is this, it is very important

31
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.280
to get a reasonable estimate of
the potential market size, and

32
00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.470
this is particularly true for
disruptive technologies.

33
00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.560
It's like using the typewriter
sales statistics to predict

34
00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:12.220
the total addressable market size for
desktops with word processing software.

35
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:18.300
And it is even more
important not to mistake

36
00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:24.661
disruptive technologies
with niche opportunities.

37
00:03:24.661 --> 00:03:29.816
Okay to McKinsey's defense,
they could not have forecast

38
00:03:29.816 --> 00:03:35.705
the actual demographics that would
actually pay to use the system.

39
00:03:35.705 --> 00:03:37.321
No one could have.

40
00:03:37.321 --> 00:03:42.190
This revolution happened
right in front of our eyes.

41
00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.285
There are now more people with cell phone,

42
00:03:46.285 --> 00:03:51.651
than a toothbrush, or
access to toilet, in the world.
