00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:09.090
There are other low power radios that
serve our near field communications.

2
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.786
These are mostly popular because of PAN,

3
00:00:12.786 --> 00:00:17.018
personal area networks,
body area networks.

4
00:00:17.018 --> 00:00:20.397
You just want to communicate in and
around you body.

5
00:00:20.397 --> 00:00:27.566
ZigBee is an specification like WiFi,
and it is a proprietary protocol.

6
00:00:27.566 --> 00:00:32.315
Both of them work in
the 2.4 gigahertz band.

7
00:00:32.315 --> 00:00:38.787
So you must have realized by now that
the 2.4 gigahertz, because of Bluetooth,

8
00:00:38.787 --> 00:00:45.070
WiFi, ZigBee and some cellular bands,
it's very, very crowded.

9
00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.390
RFID operates in the 13 megahertz band.

10
00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:55.299
It can have both active and
passive RFID tags.

11
00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:02.860
These are all relevent for
IoT applications,

12
00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.860
in terms of sensing
a region around you and

13
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.010
communicating with a hub.
