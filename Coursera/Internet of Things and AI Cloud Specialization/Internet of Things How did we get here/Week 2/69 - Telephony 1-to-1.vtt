00:00:03.913 --> 00:00:09.934
We started our story with
the telephony network and

2
00:00:09.934 --> 00:00:12.600
novelties wireless.

3
00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.849
All the computation for
the bulk orders and for the air interface,

4
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:26.930
because it is one to one,
you need traffic in both ways.

5
00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:34.040
So, the complexity on the sender and
the receiver doesn't matter.

6
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.490
The other thing that I want
you to take away from this,

7
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:44.080
is the 2G, 3G, 4G networks,

8
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:49.970
even though the control
plane is package fetched,

9
00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.120
the data plane is still circuit switched.

10
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.880
The codes or whatever resources
you take in the cellular network,

11
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:04.310
they remain allocated to you
throughout the duration of the call,

12
00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:06.500
unless you're doing y server IP.
