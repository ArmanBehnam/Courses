00:00:02.697 --> 00:00:07.047
There were, actually,
two versions of TDMA in development.

2
00:00:07.047 --> 00:00:11.504
The North American version called IS54,

3
00:00:11.504 --> 00:00:16.330
IS136 and the European version called GSM.

4
00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:23.360
For the North American version,
the 2G had to be

5
00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:28.200
backward compatible with the 1G systems.

6
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:36.080
Which they did a very nice job but
the recorder that they used was

7
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.160
less than satisfactory with
respect to voice calls.

8
00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:49.310
Especially when there was background
noise like driving in a car.

9
00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:54.988
In the early 90s, phones were very,
very expensive and

10
00:00:54.988 --> 00:01:00.348
in-car usage was a very
important use case.

11
00:01:00.348 --> 00:01:03.590
So at the receiver,

12
00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:09.050
when it got LPC parameters
corresponding to the road noise,

13
00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.200
it would happily convert
the pitch into speech like sounds.

14
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.210
And that's not the American
version was sounding like

15
00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.000
gurgling sounds or
people talking from inside a well.

16
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.700
So just because of the voice quality,
the CDMA came to a premature death and

17
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.199
the operators soon shut down
the networks and all the services.

18
00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.920
Multiple millions of dollars
were lost in that exercise.

19
00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.669
Anyway, that left
the European version GSM and

20
00:01:48.669 --> 00:01:57.200
CDMA for the 2G systems and,

21
00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:03.000
just like in the early days of telephony,
there were

22
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.800
very bitter battles about the direction
the evolutions need to take place.

23
00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.730
At that time, I was working for

24
00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.290
a boutique voice recognition company,
called Voice Processing Corporation.

25
00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.282
In Cambridge, Massachusetts, we were
providing technologies to the computer

26
00:02:25.282 --> 00:02:31.150
telephony industry condition technologies.

27
00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.570
I'd like to talk to you about
a specific date that I remember.

28
00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:41.310
On September 6th, 1996 our CEO,
David Levi Called me to his office,

29
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.510
and he showed me this
Wall Street Journal front page article.

30
00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.331
It was a pretty nasty ding on CDMA.

31
00:02:51.331 --> 00:02:54.690
And, David wanted us to pick

32
00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.820
a winning technology to support
our voice recognition services.

33
00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:05.620
And he was particularly worried about
how the Variable Bit Rate codec,

34
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.080
VBR, would affect voice
recognition performance.

35
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:17.160
So when I read the article, I knew that I
was going to work for Qualcomm, sometime.

36
00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.393
And I did tell them that
we are such a small fry,

37
00:03:21.393 --> 00:03:25.084
doesn't make sense to pick GSM or CDMA,

38
00:03:25.084 --> 00:03:29.537
we will make our technology
work equally well for

39
00:03:29.537 --> 00:03:33.665
both CBR Cortex and
VBR Cortex which we did and

40
00:03:33.665 --> 00:03:38.226
I assure some of the staff
too People at Qualcomm,

41
00:03:38.226 --> 00:03:44.774
that the VBR codec did extremely well for
voice recognition services.

42
00:03:44.774 --> 00:03:49.451
They asked me to come in and
put voice recognition on the handsets.

43
00:03:49.451 --> 00:03:56.682
So exactly an year later,
I was working at Qualcomm.

44
00:03:56.682 --> 00:04:01.979
Anyway, Europe and US made truce about

45
00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:07.276
what technology was going to be used for

46
00:04:07.276 --> 00:04:11.300
3G services going forward.

47
00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:17.220
There were two groups developing
the protocols, 3GPP and 3GPP2.

48
00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:25.590
One was mainly 3GPP2 is mainly for
America, China, Japan, Korea.

49
00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.820
And the 3GPP, Europe, Australia,

50
00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.960
there were many countries in
which both systems coexisted.

51
00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:39.700
You can think of the differences
as 220 volts versus 110 volts

52
00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:45.110
are driving on the right side of the road,
in some countries,

53
00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:50.070
and on the other side of
the road in other countries.

54
00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:57.250
And over the years, there were many,
many improvements to the air interface and

55
00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:03.830
the recorders to further improve
the voice quality and the capacity.

56
00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:09.250
I will briefly mention the next one,
the 4G LTE.

57
00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:13.660
LTE stands for long term evolution.

58
00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:18.890
This is where the protocols were
completely harmonized between

59
00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:25.260
both the camps so that you could leverage
the economies of scale much further.

60
00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:30.790
So the way DFMA works is
you can think of this very,

61
00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:37.550
very loosely as a combination of FDMA and
TDMA, simultaneously.

62
00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:40.580
Throughout the call or
throughout a session,

63
00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:44.990
the users are allocated which
carrier they will be using.

64
00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:47.530
Or which set of carriers
they will be using.

65
00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:51.220
And which time slots they will be using.

66
00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:55.320
Dynamically based on the user's need and

67
00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:00.870
the system wide load and
since we are operating on much

68
00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:06.640
larger spectrums compared
to the 3G versions we have

69
00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:11.890
much larger throughput that you
could provide to a single user and

70
00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:17.330
you also had much better
statistical multiplexing gates.
