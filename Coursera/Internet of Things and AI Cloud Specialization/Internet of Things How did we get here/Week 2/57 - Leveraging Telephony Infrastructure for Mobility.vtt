00:00:03.917 --> 00:00:08.801
As you will recall,
the control plane SS7 is now

2
00:00:08.801 --> 00:00:13.330
a completely packaged switched fabric, and

3
00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:19.900
the signaling is out of band from
the voice traffic or data plane.

4
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.750
This is a busy picture.

5
00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.890
But I just want to convey how SS7

6
00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.430
was leveraged to provide
mobility quite seamlessly.

7
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:38.540
PSTN in the picture, it stands for
Public Switched Telephone System

8
00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:44.060
sometimes, also called parts,
plain old telephone system.

9
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:49.870
In this picture I'm showing two cellular
networks both of them connecting to

10
00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.360
a PSTN network,
all through the SS7 fabric.

11
00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.870
On the cellular side
you have two databases,

12
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:09.920
HLR for the home location register, and
VLR for the visitor location register.

13
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.040
The HLR has all the details of

14
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.580
all the subscribers who have
subscribed to the service.

15
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.200
Their SIM card, their phone number,
their billing status.

16
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.960
And when you go to your city or a country,

17
00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:32.480
the Visitor Location Register,
VLR, in that particular network

18
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:38.140
will contact your Home Location Register,
HLR.

19
00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.770
And gets all the details and
temporarily stores them in the VLR.

20
00:01:47.728 --> 00:01:52.433
We also talked about multiple base
stations that you connect to as

21
00:01:52.433 --> 00:01:54.290
you drive around.

22
00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.430
So many such basestations,

23
00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:02.140
a group of them are connect to BSC or
the basestation controller.

24
00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.060
In the European side this is called RNC,
radio network controller.

25
00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.580
Both of them do exactly the same job.

26
00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.450
They coordinate between
different basestations,

27
00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.320
the towers, and
the mobile switching center.

28
00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.040
So when you are on your phone and
you turn on your phone.

29
00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.530
When you see three to five bars,

30
00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.950
what it means is the phone has
found a base station nearby.

31
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.090
And the base station ask the HLR
if you are a legit customer,

32
00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.880
through authentication.

33
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.800
Maybe you are not paying all your bills.

34
00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:49.080
And the HLR's recognized you and
gave go ahead to the base station.

35
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.450
And if you're roaming,
there is an additional step that the VLR

36
00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:00.050
contacts your HLR and
brings all your information.

37
00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:06.970
So, what this means is variable

38
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:12.160
UR when your phone is on, the system
keeps track of which base station

39
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.020
is closest to you,
even when you are in a far, far place.

40
00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:24.790
When someone calls you, it goes to
the mobile switching center, MSC,

41
00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:32.130
and it finds the right play station
where you are and drops the call to you.

42
00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.500
The same thing happens when
someone sends you a text,

43
00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.670
this is handled by a different module

44
00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.400
on the network called
Short Message Service Center, SMSC.

45
00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:52.180
In reality, these are very,
very complex processes but

46
00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.370
I just wanted to give you
a flavor of how mobility works.

47
00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.720
And how the SS7 from
the wireline telephony

48
00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.250
was very easily leveraged
to give you mobility.
