00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:06.200
So, what this meant was there
were a lots of smaller players

2
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.390
who could build these
network elements just using

3
00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:16.670
off the shelf components like
a desktop computer and a phone card.

4
00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.680
And many, many,
vendors were providing middleware

5
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.870
that would give access to
the basic telephone functionality.

6
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.320
Telephone application
programmers interface.

7
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.720
And you had Java, J type E,
and many other portions.

8
00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.010
And what they would do is,
you could do call set up,

9
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.360
you could do connection,
tear down, billing.

10
00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:50.100
And in addition to that, you could
do all kinds of clever processing

11
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.050
on the computer and control the network.

12
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.830
That's why it's called
advanced intelligent network.
