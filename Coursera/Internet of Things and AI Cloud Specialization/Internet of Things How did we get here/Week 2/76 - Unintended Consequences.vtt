1
00:00:03.553 --> 00:00:07.132
So we are going to switch
the gears a little bit and

2
00:00:07.132 --> 00:00:13.600
see how one of the most powerful sensors,
the GPS, got into the cellphone.

3
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:20.268
See, the telephone was very popular in
the 50s and 60s, and it was growing.

4
00:00:20.268 --> 00:00:24.740
And, people realized how useful
it would be to respond to crime,

5
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.220
fires, highway accidents,
medical emergencies.

6
00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.540
Every house had a telephone.

7
00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:38.680
So, they set up these PSAP's,
public safety answering points,

8
00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:46.000
which would receive all the 9-1-1 calls,
and they would do the first triage,

9
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.930
and see what kind of help
needed to be sent to whom.

10
00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:55.980
And this actually started
in 1957 in Australia and

11
00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.490
Canada in the 1966 after the U.S.
and the Congress and

12
00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:08.020
the White House got onto AT&T,
it started in U.S., also.

13
00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.370
This is essentially how it works.

14
00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:16.670
You can think of the Bob and Sheldon
that we used in the previous example.

15
00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.420
So there's a 911 caller and
the SR7 database.

16
00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:29.380
It has a master street guide and
address, MSAG in this example.

17
00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:35.310
So when somebody calls 911,
it goes to PSAP,

18
00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.290
that's the public safety answering point.

19
00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:39.910
And they get all the information.

20
00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:46.460
And when this is happening, in
the background, the their actual address.

21
00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.730
It's called automatic
location information.

22
00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:52.580
ALI.

23
00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.780
That's the physical address of the caller.

24
00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.200
It's actually sent to the PSAP.

25
00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.750
And they can get the activities
started in the background.

26
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.160
The agent is still talking to the person
having an emergency in terms of

27
00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:11.760
dispatching a fire truck or
an ambulance, or whatever it was.

28
00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:19.640
It took about 45 years to cover
the entire North American

29
00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.420
population of about 400 million,
this is Canada and U.S.

30
00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:30.110
to have the complete 911 coverage.

31
00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.870
And this is a slight sidebar.

32
00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:44.360
In 2004 or 2005 there was a company

33
00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.750
in India that was using the computer
telephoning integration

34
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.390
interactive voice response that we
covered in one of the previous modules.

35
00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.040
They covered 400 million people in India

36
00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.730
with one way services which
is their counterpart.

37
00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.277
in a period of five
years all using computer

38
00:03:07.277 --> 00:03:11.580
telephone integration technologies.

39
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.640
The really amazing thing about this
service was not just the technology,

40
00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:24.177
the CTI or the architecture elements.

41
00:03:24.177 --> 00:03:28.900
It was the human factors of it,
the human capital.

42
00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:36.480
The way they trained a very
large staff of ambulances and

43
00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:43.060
the call centers and each call center has
actually a doctor physically present,

44
00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.658
talking to the patient very very

45
00:03:47.658 --> 00:03:53.490
interesting development.

46
00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:59.218
Anyway, going back to
the growth of the cell phone,

47
00:03:59.218 --> 00:04:05.820
by 1996 they saw that

48
00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:11.060
the growth of the cell phone was much
bigger than what they had anticipated.

49
00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.670
And by 2000, they were going to have

50
00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.850
more cell phone connections
than the landline phone.

51
00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:20.980
This was a problem.

52
00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.376
What do you do with, All the 9-1-1?

53
00:04:24.376 --> 00:04:27.679
The person could be anywhere else.

54
00:04:27.679 --> 00:04:33.290
So, the 9-1-1 system
was going to be broken.

55
00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:38.908
So in 1996 the FCC got in again and

56
00:04:38.908 --> 00:04:45.650
they mandated the E911 in two phases.

57
00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:50.870
The phase one, which pretty much started
immediately, they needed to bypass

58
00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:56.490
all the building software in their
networks if it was a 911 call.

59
00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:00.720
So, even if the phone is not
registered to a specific operator like,

60
00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:06.830
Voto Fone or Verizon,
you still had to complete the call.

61
00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.755
In phase two, starting in 2001,

62
00:05:11.755 --> 00:05:17.630
25% of the handsets need to have
automatic location information,

63
00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:23.300
ALI, and by 2005 all

64
00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:30.050
handsets that they were gonna be selling
were to have this particular capability.

65
00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:36.230
And they left a lot of wiggle room in
terms of the accuracy that they needed.

66
00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:41.286
So that they could provide
the location-based services,

67
00:05:41.286 --> 00:05:46.141
either using some of
the handset-based technologies or

68
00:05:46.141 --> 00:05:51.213
a combination of cell towers and
hand based technologies.
