1
00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.090
The inner of things in automotive space.

2
00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:06.200
We all love cars, right?

3
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.390
They're getting fancier by the day, and

4
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.740
you're at the point where cars is gonna
be 90% software, only 10% hardware.

5
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.732
It's like millions of lines of code.

6
00:00:15.732 --> 00:00:20.320
I was actually getting a ride from
a friend in his new Tesla, and

7
00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.532
he was telling me like
I shouldn't say new.

8
00:00:23.532 --> 00:00:25.320
He had it for three years.

9
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.456
He was telling me he has a better
car now than he had three years ago.

10
00:00:28.456 --> 00:00:29.152
I said, what are you talking about?

11
00:00:29.152 --> 00:00:29.859
Do you have a different car?

12
00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:30.890
No, it's the same car.

13
00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:31.700
So why do you say that?

14
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.270
He says it's the software updates.

15
00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.040
The functionality of the car gets
better with these new software updates.

16
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.560
Apparently the Tesla when
you are on an incline,

17
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.710
before it was not perfectly
rolled back and then guess what?

18
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.500
Came out and software updated.

19
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.470
It has a better algorithm
to kind of balance it out.

20
00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.530
So he says I have a better car
now than he did three years ago,

21
00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.360
thanks to software and remote update.

22
00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.990
So I want to kind of partition
the car into like the the features

23
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:08.850
available one is the high end cars have,
some of the high end cars constantly have

24
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.190
activity in order words
a phone is better in the car,

25
00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.040
which has a constant an IP address,
the car can be pinged at any time.

26
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.980
Not all cars have that, most of the lower
end cars like his they tend to try to

27
00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.530
use your phone for backend connectivity.

28
00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.830
So, you get in with your phone to the car.

29
00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.430
The phone has bluetooth and

30
00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.770
the car connects to your phone though
bluetooth and some data is exchanged.

31
00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.260
And, that's sent to the backend.

32
00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.660
So, for

33
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:41.420
cars where the cost has to be low, they
can't afford to fit in an embedded cell.

34
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.625
And finally there's this
thing at called OBD-II.

35
00:01:46.625 --> 00:01:49.480
It stands for
Onboard Diagnostics Connector.

36
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.410
So this is the one your mechanic plugs
in whenever some check engine light or

37
00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:55.630
something comes on.

38
00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.230
The car is putting out some
codes through this connector.

39
00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:01.990
Hey this is what's going on, they
translated that code to what the problem

40
00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.920
is, and in fact you can talk
through the connector too.

41
00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.630
There are these dongles available
through Bluetooth, you plug it in, and

42
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.230
you can get those codes.

43
00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.070
In fact, you can get information
such as how far the car is gone,

44
00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.660
GPS information, but
not enough to mess up the car but

45
00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.010
those hackers been hacking
the car remotely these days.

46
00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.290
Tesla has been shut down,
Jeep has been shut down.

47
00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.680
So all these vulnerabilities,
your car is becoming like the computers so

48
00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.080
they can remotely be shown
how to turn off these cars.

49
00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.920
But, just keep this in mind and

50
00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.980
connection to the car using your phone
as [INAUDIBLE] and this connector.

51
00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.900
So let's talk a bit
about what are possible.

52
00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.620
So let's take the first scenario where
something like a Tesla which has built in

53
00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.320
connection, embedded connection,
and has on board connectors.

54
00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.690
So some of the services I'm talking
about here are kind of arcane,

55
00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.860
like it's not futuristic.

56
00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.530
These have been around for awhile,
but I just want to give you a flavor.

57
00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:01.720
One is airbag deployment.

58
00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:08.430
You go into a tree, remote somewhere,
no one has seen the car go into a tree.

59
00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.890
But the car knows the airbag has deployed,
you hit a tree,

60
00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:16.310
because it puts this message in the bus,
and how to inform somebody.

61
00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.980
So the car is built in, if it has
an embedded unit, it can inform that hey,

62
00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.550
make a call, remotely tell
somebody the airbag is deployed.

63
00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:31.120
And it also sends the location, where
the car is, because it has built in GPS.

64
00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.220
It can send you help.

65
00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.190
Dolan Lock.

66
00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.290
A lot of times you walk out, boom.

67
00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.400
You forget the keys in the car and
you lock the car.

68
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.790
How to remotely unlock the car.

69
00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.240
So if it has this built
in embedded system,

70
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.190
you can send a command to
the car through its IP.

71
00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.680
Get in contact and say unlock.

72
00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.480
But then there's this problem the cars.

73
00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.820
This device is not going to be on all
the time because of power constraints.

74
00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.360
You can suck the car battery dry.

75
00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.670
Not that this takes that much power,
but who knows.

76
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.450
You may leave your car in the parking
lot of an airport, be gone for a month.

77
00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.670
When you come back,
your car still shouldn't start.

78
00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.570
So there are requirements in the amount
of power this device can draw from

79
00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.230
the car battery.

80
00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.500
And so the way you'll approach
this problem is wake up cycles.

81
00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.480
This thing will wake up every ten minutes,
15 minutes, you got something for me?

82
00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.220
Is there any messages waiting for me?

83
00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.380
If it does, then it will process that.

84
00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.410
One of the messages is, unlock the car.

85
00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.090
Boom, it unlocks the car.

86
00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.130
So it's not going to be
an immediate unlock.

87
00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:39.460
Any type of things where you wanna
have don't, even in this course,

88
00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.960
you wanna have something running
on its own without electric power,

89
00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.830
you need to have some kind
of a wake up strategy.

90
00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:46.480
For example,

91
00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:51.550
you may run a system where your thing
doesn't need to be on 24 hours a day.

92
00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.710
Maybe just eight hours.

93
00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.010
You can set it to go to sleep, but

94
00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:59.490
sometimes you may have another device
wake it up which is more power efficient.

95
00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.770
Honk Horn is like yeah,
you park somewhere in a parking lot,

96
00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.710
it's eight layers deep and
you come back and you can't find your car.

97
00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.270
And your remote fob only works
at a certain distance and

98
00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.000
you're trying to find your car.

99
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.340
You can use these systems to
remotely make your car honk.

100
00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:16.900
And also remotely start your car.

101
00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:21.140
You live in a cold, frigid place and
you know how you go sit in the car and

102
00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:24.270
let the car run for
like two minutes while you're freezing.

103
00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:27.600
In this case, you can just say,
I'm ready to go to work.

104
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:32.150
Let it start remotely and then when it
warmed up you go hop in, get to work.

105
00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.780
And also stop you from from texting,
right, you know it's crazy.

106
00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:38.751
You drive by in the car,
you see everybody's like [SOUND] you know.

107
00:05:38.751 --> 00:05:40.910
It's scary and I'm doing that too,
watching like.

108
00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:44.160
It's impossible to stop yourself
from interacting with your phone.

109
00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:49.040
So there are people who come up with
solutions through these OBD connector,

110
00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.200
when you know it's driving, it talks
to the phone through Bluetooth, and

111
00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:55.400
says you're driving now, I know you're
driving now I won't let you use the phone.

112
00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.590
But it requires,
it should say permission from your part,

113
00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:02.470
it's not gonna happen automatically.

114
00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:04.790
Finally vehicle diagnostics.

115
00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:09.010
You know these vehicle recalls you hear
about, they discover something for you,

116
00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:11.570
they wait until three years later and
then so

117
00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:14.440
many people have died in vehicle crashes.

118
00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:18.980
And this could be prevented
by this IoT type of stuff.

119
00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:24.510
What's happening is that car manufacturers
find out something that is wrong through

120
00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:27.780
when people take their cars
to the other dealers and

121
00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:30.600
the auto dealers send that
information to the manufacturers.

122
00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:34.410
Hey, we've got so many of this problem,
people complaining of this and

123
00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:36.550
the manufacturers look at it,
by then it's too late.

124
00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:38.170
Years have gone by.

125
00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:43.470
And so many and next year models sold out
too, so there's no realtime feedback.

126
00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:48.940
With a new approach, embedded system or
through your phone, the car is diagnosing

127
00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:53.000
itself and sending this information
back to the manufacturer in realtime.

128
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.440
So if some fault happens,
they can catch the very early stage,

129
00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:01.990
and prevent the problem,
the next leads are make recalls at a much

130
00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:04.360
earlier stage than waiting for
a few years.

131
00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:09.720
Okay so the next set is where the car
doesn't have an embedded phone but

132
00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:13.480
it depends on your phone.

133
00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:19.320
So you walk in with your phone, the car
knows your phone, it's through Bluetooth.

134
00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:22.300
And it starts using
the services of your phone.

135
00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:27.520
The Internet connection,
you've got your music in your phone.

136
00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.410
You've got your contacts, calendar.

137
00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:33.850
And this has to be married in
some integrated fashion so

138
00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:36.550
you don't have to pull your
phone out of your pocket.

139
00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:40.740
If you're in the car, let's say this
is what Apple's coming with, CarPlay.

140
00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:43.670
You drop your phone into a connector.

141
00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:47.790
All the services, your information,
entertainment in your phone should be

142
00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:52.770
available in your car,
in a hands free mode, so

143
00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:56.200
you can forget about driving and
interact with your phone.

144
00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:56.770
I'm just kidding.

145
00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:01.130
The distractions are increasingly
complex these days.

146
00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:04.680
You know when the radio came on,
they introduced the radio in the car,

147
00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:05.400
I don't know, 60?

148
00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.500
70 years ago?

149
00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:11.640
They had the same complaint, oh but
it's gonna be a distraction to the driver.

150
00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:18.752
But now the phone's invading your car and
you're gonna be distracted no doubt what.

151
00:08:18.752 --> 00:08:24.105
So Apple has this Car Play, and
Google has Open Automotive Alliance,

152
00:08:24.105 --> 00:08:29.276
like how to, bringing your car
bringing your phone into your car and

153
00:08:29.276 --> 00:08:34.630
offer each other service in a none
destructive fashion easier said and

154
00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:39.168
then done right but
you gonna see that it's gonna happen and

155
00:08:39.168 --> 00:08:43.550
finally wait to communication
increasingly hot topic.

156
00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:46.710
It's how cars are gonna start
communicating with each other.

157
00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:50.780
Send some information back and
forth, ideas like, you know if like,

158
00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:55.720
further down the freeway, there is
an accident happening, your car comes

159
00:08:55.720 --> 00:09:00.010
to a screech, and the cars kind of relay
the information back down the line,

160
00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:04.728
and there's also there's something called
[INAUDIBLE] infrastructure communication,

161
00:09:04.728 --> 00:09:07.830
where car sends information
infrastructure on the side of the freeway.

162
00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:14.430
And for an interesting application I
heard was like, if you have cars going

163
00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:19.960
down a freeway, all had their wiper
blades going, means it's raining, right?

164
00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:26.020
And each car knows where it is and
it knows the wiper blades are on, and it

165
00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:30.820
can send information back to the server,
hey, here's my location, here's my status.

166
00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:35.740
And it can infer weather conditions based
on information coming from the car.

167
00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:37.810
So, all these great things are happening.

168
00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:41.060
So, in this course, I don't know if
you get to work with the car, but

169
00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:43.540
if you do it'd be so cool, but stay safe.
