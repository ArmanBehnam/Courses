00:00:03.491 --> 00:00:04.230
>> Hey guys.

2
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.710
I want to take a moment here and summarize
what this specialization is all about.

3
00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:10.720
I know it's a long haul here.

4
00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:17.110
I want to quickly go over
what it breaks down into.

5
00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.430
First, I want to define
this Internet of Things.

6
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.810
What the heck is it?

7
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.640
You know you've heard this term so
many times.

8
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.775
You've heard so
many different definitions of it.

9
00:00:25.775 --> 00:00:30.580
I want to give my version of it,
and how it applies to this course.

10
00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.220
Second, I want to go over how to,

11
00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.910
what do you need to build
your own Internet of Things.

12
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.840
Whatever you dream up
in terms of hardware,

13
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.080
skill set, programming requirements, etc.

14
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.040
So I'll go over that in two.

15
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.840
Three, prerequisites right?

16
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.740
What kind of skills do we expect you to
have to be successful in this course.

17
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.180
Programming wise, hardware wise and
also set expectations straight so

18
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.320
you don't go away disappointed,
and we don't disappoint you.

19
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.470
And finally, I want to go over each
of the courses in a nutshell quickly.

20
00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:04.940
We got six courses here.

21
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.047
So I will kind of break each of them down.
