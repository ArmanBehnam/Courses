00:00:04.302 --> 00:00:08.430
The internal of things and mHealth,
mHealth stands for mobile health.

2
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.970
It's how these mobile devices are helping
you achieve your fitness goals,

3
00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:18.050
lead a healthier lifestyle, and
also help you cure your diseases.

4
00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:23.490
Okay, so there we are,
for me, on I'm overweight,

5
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.740
or I'm sick, I can't get out of my car,
stop watching TV, and can someone help me?

6
00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.290
So what?

7
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:32.570
There are all these devices.

8
00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.340
You know, there's release of these watch,
the Apple watch, the Android watch,

9
00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.850
you wear them, it kind of keeps
track of how active you are.

10
00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.529
And if you've been sitting
around too long, I know at least

11
00:00:43.529 --> 00:00:48.290
the Apple voice says get around,
move around, you've been sitting too long.

12
00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.960
Get up for the first few times,
you obey the law.

13
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.270
But after that, you become immune to it.

14
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.970
And then there is these bracelets,
Fitbits, you wear.

15
00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.320
Kind of keeps track of how many
steps you took during the day.

16
00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.560
Encourages you to be more active and when
you are near the phone, it syncs your data

17
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.730
with the phone, gives historical
statistics, how active you've been.

18
00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:17.620
And of course there are these heart rate
monitors people wear when you work out,

19
00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.250
and again, it sends data to your phone.

20
00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.890
So when you're working out it can red
line, so make sure you are hitting

21
00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.630
the peak, you can do interval training,
things like that.

22
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.342
So all of these devices,
slew of devices come into the market, and

23
00:01:31.342 --> 00:01:34.012
all these work with your
phone in some fashion.

24
00:01:34.012 --> 00:01:38.429
You can quantify yourself how
effective you are in working out.

25
00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:41.353
And here's the iOS health screen,

26
00:01:41.353 --> 00:01:46.790
it can keep track of the activity for
the day, the nutrition.

27
00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.650
For example,
you have apps like MyFitnessPal.

28
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.650
You can go log all the stuff you ate for
the day.

29
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.630
You can list the calories, so
you can target set number of calories for

30
00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.246
the week and
how many pounds you want to lose.

31
00:02:01.246 --> 00:02:05.250
Blood sugar, sleep, and all of these
devices, since you sleep with them they

32
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.560
can see how much you figit and
how good of sleep you get.

33
00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.940
In fact, you can buy devices which kind of
measures how much REM sleep you had and

34
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.070
your respiratory rate, oxygen saturation,
of course, most importantly weight.

35
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.050
There is weighing scales right now,
you stand on it.

36
00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.070
It's supposed to measure your fat
content by sending some pulses.

37
00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.620
I don't know how accurate they are but
all these devices

38
00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.760
have entered the market now to
help you with your health health.

39
00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.070
And these guys work
with your mobile phone.

40
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.820
And all this data is collected and

41
00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.590
sent to some server somewhere,
with huge amounts of data.

42
00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.310
So what do they do with that data?

43
00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.170
Let me come to that next.

44
00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.630
It's the field of big data analytics.

45
00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.510
So it's so difficult to lose weight right?

46
00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.560
So many people try to come up with
techniques people can follow to

47
00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.100
lose weight but
it's becoming a really difficult problem.

48
00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.530
So see if they can find patterns for

49
00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.390
those people who lose weight
what do they achieve?

50
00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.690
For example like Netflix,
runs all these serials.

51
00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:17.800
They try to figure out when do people get
hooked after a certain number of episodes.

52
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.090
So for example, there's this
popular series called Breaking Bad.

53
00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.500
It seems people get hooked after
the third episode, or second episode,

54
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.700
something like that.

55
00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.040
And so they're looking at
the patterns of people watching.

56
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.910
They can figure out when they
get hooked and they try and

57
00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.240
come up with a formula to hook you in.

58
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.580
After that, once you get hooked,
they can feed you any junk you want and

59
00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.810
you'll keep watching it
because you're hooked.

60
00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.220
So, same with weight loss.

61
00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.380
They're trying to come
up with this magic pill.

62
00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:48.600
Hey, if it works then you kind of hit
your stride, start losing weight.

63
00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:49.340
Data analytics.

64
00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.400
So I want to give you some examples.

65
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.820
One interesting one is the Target
shopping store in the US

66
00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:02.280
stumbled upon this pregnancy
prediction algorithm which they knew

67
00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.920
somebody was pregnant even
before the person knew.

68
00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.220
How it worked out was Target was
running some analytics on data they

69
00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.340
had collected off people's buying habits.

70
00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.460
And they knew some of the women who
were pregnant because they had a baby

71
00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:18.510
registry set up.

72
00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.470
Once the baby arrives,
these are the things they want.

73
00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.090
And they start analyzing all
the products they bought over time.

74
00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.220
And they noticed some pattern in them.

75
00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.940
They all bought unscented lotion,
big cotton balls, and

76
00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.640
certain type of paper napkins.

77
00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.730
Guess what,
they started targeting them with coupons,

78
00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.960
they started mailing coupons to them.

79
00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.490
Now hey, dollar off this,
$5 off nappies, and all that.

80
00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:52.350
And apparently one day this angry dad
came to the store, shown this thing.

81
00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:57.870
What the hell are you guys doing sending
my teen daughter these coupons for

82
00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:58.390
nappies?

83
00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:59.890
She's not pregnant.

84
00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:04.690
And she was apparently a teen,
and the store apologized.

85
00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.600
Said, okay, sorry.

86
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:07.970
We won't do that.

87
00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:09.670
And later the dad called back and said,

88
00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:13.140
you know what, apparently things were
going on in the house I didn't know about.

89
00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:14.690
My teen is indeed pregnant.

90
00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:19.110
So, your buying habits and

91
00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:24.020
using big data can infer certain
things even you're not aware of.

92
00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:27.460
By the way, there's a link to this
when you watch the MOOC you can access

93
00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.250
the document if you wanna read about that.

94
00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.040
You can click on the video unfortunately.

95
00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.410
Second interesting example is,

96
00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:39.940
you know you wear these FitBits when you
sleep, it can keep track of your motion.

97
00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:46.124
The jawbone guys who make the up wearable,
they did this study,

98
00:05:46.124 --> 00:05:51.203
there was an earthquake in Berkeley,
a couple years ago, or a year ago.

99
00:05:51.203 --> 00:05:52.508
And when it happened of course you're

100
00:05:52.508 --> 00:05:54.278
going to wake up if you're
close to the epicenter.

101
00:05:54.278 --> 00:05:59.050
Oh, and you're farther away from the
epicenter you're less likely to feel it

102
00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:01.200
and probably you slept better.

103
00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.040
So this study was about how

104
00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:09.490
much people got disturbed based on
their distance from the epicenter.

105
00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:11.070
So I want to show you the slide next.

106
00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:12.340
Let me come back to this.

107
00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:13.620
So here's the graph.

108
00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.982
The earthquake happened at 3 AM.

109
00:06:17.982 --> 00:06:21.860
And so you see people waking up.

110
00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.980
And the blue is by Napa,

111
00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:29.830
Sonoma, Berkeley, closest to
the epicenter of the earthquake.

112
00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:34.530
And those guys woke up, and
it took them longer to fall asleep.

113
00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:37.850
And the second curve, you see
the green one, San Francisco, Oakland,

114
00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:38.720
those guys woke up too.

115
00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.220
They were further away
from the epi-center.

116
00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:42.370
They were not that disturbed.

117
00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:46.350
And so further and further down, you see
guys, as they recede from the epicenter,

118
00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:50.640
they were less disturbed and slept better.

119
00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:55.020
And they came up with stats that
millions of hours of sleep was lost

120
00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:59.840
because of this earthquake, blah,
blah, but the here point is,

121
00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:05.540
all these variables are generating data
which can be inferred in unique ways.

122
00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:10.240
So this internal of things
is going to come up with

123
00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:13.650
new areas using data analytics to infer
things which you didn't know about, and

124
00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:17.100
hopefully one of them is
to detect patterns and

125
00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:21.410
help you achieve the healthy
lifestyle we all want.

126
00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:22.710
The final one I want to say.

127
00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:24.530
This always freaks people out.

128
00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:29.100
If you have an iPhone,
pull it out and go to settings,

129
00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:33.154
privacy, location services,
system services and frequent locations.

130
00:07:33.154 --> 00:07:39.240
What it does is your phone keeps track
of the frequent places you visit, and if

131
00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:44.180
you go here, if you have it turned on, it
shows you all the places you've been to.

132
00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:48.580
And they go, oh shit, I didn't know people
made it turn it off in front of me.

133
00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:52.730
So you guys should turn it off too
if you don't want to be tracked.

134
00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:56.440
So, think of it, that your phone knows
the frequent places that you go to.

135
00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:58.180
A mall, or whatever it is.

136
00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:03.420
And they can get started hitting
you with shopping offers.

137
00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:06.880
It's all about trying to sell you
something, knowing where you are.

138
00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:07.630
That's all they track.

139
00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:15.355
Okay, finally I eluded to this in
my previous lesson, the HAPIfork.

140
00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:20.420
Losing weight, right,
it's such a big challenge.

141
00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:21.630
And here's my theory.

142
00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:27.280
One is, humans are incredibly
efficient in absorbing calories.

143
00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:31.150
We absorb 100 percent of
the calories we consume and

144
00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:36.340
it is I should say when you work out
you burn ridiculously little amount.

145
00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:40.060
If you eat a toast it's
say 200 calories and

146
00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:44.390
you ride your bike for half hour and
say all you burn is 200 calories.

147
00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:48.700
So the amount of food we need to
kind of do the things we do everyday

148
00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:49.770
averages so little.

149
00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:57.800
So the theory is when you eat you
typically if you are like me, I pig out.

150
00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:00.160
I eat, just don't focus on anything else.

151
00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.130
Just chow it down.

152
00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:05.370
There's a delay in the time your
brain tells you are full to

153
00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:06.630
actually when you are full.

154
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:09.510
So there is the brain kicks in later,
like five minutes later.

155
00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:11.690
By that time you have stuffed yourself.

156
00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:16.810
So the goal is to kind of slow down
the speed at which you eat and

157
00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:23.690
also take bites between every dip it
should be sufficiently spaced out.

158
00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:28.650
So there's this idea for this HAPIfork
it has built in sensors to detect how

159
00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:34.170
fast you eat and
you can also plug into your phone and

160
00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:37.430
it gives you statistics on how you ate.

161
00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:40.900
I think it's got a cool
thing like fork servings.

162
00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:46.300
You took 59 fork servings for
this meal means you took 59 bites.

163
00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:49.888
And the time it took, and
the goal is to spread it out.

164
00:09:49.888 --> 00:09:53.510
Each is slower, so by the time you're full
your brain tells you, you're full, and
