00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.370
Hello.
This is Carl Kassel.

2
00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.650
You might be thinking, Wait, wait.

3
00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.080
Isn't this Ryan's phone?

4
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.590
Don't tell me I've
dialed the wrong number.

5
00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.800
Well, I assure you, you have not.

6
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.970
Leave whatever message you'd like and
Ryan will be sure to return your call.

7
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.060
And have a wonderful day.

8
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:24.710
>> That was actually Karl Kassel's voice.

9
00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:30.910
He's part of this, for
those of you who don't live in the U.S.,

10
00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.570
it's weekly,
new quiz show called, Wait, wait,

11
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.400
don't Tell Me, and you can actually
win Carl Kassel's voice for

12
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.783
your home answering machine.

13
00:00:44.783 --> 00:00:49.420
The home answering machine
date back many decades.

14
00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.300
The reason why this was really cool was

15
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.580
about 35% of the business calls end of it,
no answer.

16
00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:03.130
This is not good for the telephone
company, not good for the business.

17
00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.510
So there were all kinds of answering
machines that people could

18
00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.490
connect to their phone.

19
00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.549
And if you didn't pick up the phone,
the answering machine would pick up play

20
00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:21.190
Karl Kassel's voice and get
the recording so you could check later.

21
00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:26.590
And with SS7 and
the advanced intelligent network,

22
00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.540
there were many many companies
that were actually providing

23
00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.570
a unified messaging service.

24
00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:41.980
There you could have your emails,
voicemails, faxes,

25
00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:47.840
pagers, all of them coordinated
in one central place.

26
00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.310
And it was actually going
more enterprise In the cloud,

27
00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.080
all of these services being provided.

28
00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.550
So this was a very good revenue bearing
thing, both with the telephone companies

29
00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:06.160
and a lot of the start-ups in the 80s and
90s.
