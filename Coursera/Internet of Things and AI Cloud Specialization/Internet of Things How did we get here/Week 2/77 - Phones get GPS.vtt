00:00:03.713 --> 00:00:08.285
So to address the FCC mandate,
with all the wiggle room and

2
00:00:08.285 --> 00:00:14.470
everything, it was pretty clear
that you needed GPS in the handset.

3
00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:21.910
It was going to be very very expensive but
the potential applications were huge.

4
00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:27.690
So after the initial knee-jerk reaction
of complaining that it cannot be done,

5
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:32.560
it would be too expensive,
whatever, by the operators, they

6
00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:39.950
accepted the FCC E91 mandate and
promptly passed the buck to their vendors.

7
00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.725
Now it was up to the handset vendors,
the infrastructure vendors,

8
00:00:44.725 --> 00:00:49.020
and the chipset manufacturers
to provide this capability.

9
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.030
GPS works by triangulation or
trilateration.

10
00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:03.340
You need signals from at least three
satellites, but four is always better.

11
00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:09.080
And there are 24 satellites going
around the Earth twice a day and

12
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.980
you needed to get these signals
in order to find your location.

13
00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:20.180
It's a very mature technology,
has been around for 35 years.

14
00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.560
But to put it in the phones,
it requires new radios,

15
00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.650
because GPS is 1.5 gigahertz and
1.2 gigahertz,

16
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.080
not the 800 to 900, and
1800 to 1900 megahertz specs.

17
00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.576
And you also need a lot more computation
In the chipset in order to correlate

18
00:01:40.576 --> 00:01:45.250
all the signals from the satellites and
estimate the position.

19
00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:52.405
But by 2005,
GPS was standard fare in all smartphones,

20
00:01:52.405 --> 00:01:57.737
and that was because there were so
many new and

21
00:01:57.737 --> 00:02:04.630
engaging applications that
the GPS was going to unleash.

22
00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:14.002
There were so many applications with
incredible amount of implications for

23
00:02:14.002 --> 00:02:18.609
commerce and small business,
in addition to navigation and

24
00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:21.530
other apps that you could use.

25
00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:27.450
And also, it was going to unleash so
many clever social media applications.

26
00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:33.350
So I think we should thank FCC for
mandating GPS in our cell phones.
