00:00:03.073 --> 00:00:06.820
So, getting back to the story
of features and apps.

2
00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:10.170
For about 10 to 12 years,

3
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.420
the phones were going through really
rapid changes in terms of the designs and

4
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.530
the sensors that they were getting and
the features that they were enabling.

5
00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.120
The most important thing was phones
were getting much smaller and

6
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:31.150
they would get much longer
standby time and talk time.

7
00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:36.730
And the charges for making voice calls
was also dropping very, very fast.

8
00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:42.470
So you didn't need to use your cell
phone as a portable pay phone and email.

9
00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:47.170
That is,
you turn off as soon as you make the call.

10
00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.730
I actually remember doing
that with my earlier phones.

11
00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.120
Then there were flip phones and
phones with touch screens.

12
00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.230
And phones of various shapes and colors.

13
00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:10.120
And then there were phones with
two screens and it was almost like

14
00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:16.664
the phone business was going through
some kind of an identity crisis.

15
00:01:16.664 --> 00:01:20.977
There were phones specifically for
business folks.

16
00:01:20.977 --> 00:01:26.370
That was a very big,
attractive selling point.

17
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.128
And some of the features were more
nerdy like, there was this Samsung

18
00:01:33.128 --> 00:01:38.550
phone that you could use to
write phone number in the air.

19
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.802
That's the first time
an accelerometer got into the phone.

20
00:01:43.802 --> 00:01:48.840
The one you see next to
that is the first iPhone,

21
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.250
in which they were using the same
accelerometer for portrait and

22
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:59.840
landscape mode to look at the pictures
that you took with your camera.

23
00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.630
So by this time, less than ten years ago,

24
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:15.030
what exactly a smartphone is and its look
and feel, got pretty much established.

25
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.909
And now we're going to
be talking about all

26
00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:23.110
the features that could
be a mobile platform,

27
00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.730
as opposed to features in
the network that we covered before.
