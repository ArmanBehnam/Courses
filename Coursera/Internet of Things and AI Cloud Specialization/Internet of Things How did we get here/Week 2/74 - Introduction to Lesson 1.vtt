00:00:03.896 --> 00:00:10.396
In the previous modules,
we saw multiple disciplines

2
00:00:10.396 --> 00:00:15.350
converging to give us this IoT platform.

3
00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.860
In this, now we will look at
how some of the interesting

4
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.710
features got added to the smart
phone tablet platform.

5
00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:35.420
And the effect of
the scale of the network.

6
00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.860
See, the network effect is
the value of a network is

7
00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.040
the square of the number
of people connected to it.

8
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.940
So as more and more people are on the
network, the value goes up exponentially.

9
00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.945
So, we will see how some of the features
that got added to the smartphone

10
00:00:55.025 --> 00:01:01.935
exponentially increased the value, the
applications that scale with the network.
