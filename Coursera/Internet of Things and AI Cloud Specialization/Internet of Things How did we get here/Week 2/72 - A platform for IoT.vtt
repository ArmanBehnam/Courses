00:00:03.839 --> 00:00:09.439
What we are seeing here
is all of these different

2
00:00:09.439 --> 00:00:13.919
networks, all wirelessly enabled,

3
00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:21.700
can now be implemented on a smart phone,
tablet platform.

4
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:26.400
And because of the multiple radios and

5
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.780
multiple bands that need to be
supported for making voice calls,

6
00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:39.600
for instance, when you have 4G technology,
you still need to carry 3G technology.

7
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.870
And this is essentially
the story of the convergence of

8
00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:51.780
electronics circular designs all of this
electronics and communication theory.

9
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:58.010
True the CDM is lot more complex than
TDMA, but the electronics had evolved so

10
00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:04.270
that you could implement them
very efficiently on a platform.

11
00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:09.547
So the upside of this for our story is

12
00:01:09.547 --> 00:01:15.820
you have a platform that
very rich computational

13
00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.790
capabilities, the microprocessor and
the digital signal processor.

14
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.680
Very rich connectivity capabilities.

15
00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.350
All the different radios
that are available.

16
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.656
And the way you can connect
this to multiple sensors and

17
00:01:33.656 --> 00:01:38.619
implement all the different
network technologies

18
00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:41.862
that we have talked about so far.

19
00:01:41.862 --> 00:01:48.175
And we will use one of these
platforms in a subsequent course for

20
00:01:48.175 --> 00:01:51.392
your hands-on experience, so

21
00:01:51.392 --> 00:01:56.170
that you can build your
own internet of things.
