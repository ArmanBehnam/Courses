It is hard to imagine life without your Smartphone – you have come to rely on it so much – for your work; to stay in touch with family and friends; to capture and share those special moments; to find your way around in a new neighborhood. Did you ever wonder how and when all this happened? Or how and when GPS sensors came to be in your cell phone?

In this course, we will explore the convergence of multiple disciplines leading to todays’ Smartphones.  You will learn about the birth and evolution of Telephony Networks, Broadcast Networks (TV and Radio) and Consumer Electronics.  We will discuss the impact of Internet, (multimedia) content, smartphones and apps on everyday lives. We will then look at how this emerging platform called the Internet of Things – wherein billions and trillions of devices communicating with each other and “the cloud” – could enable unprecedented, innovative products and services.   Take this course if you want to understand what great new advances in mobile-enabled products will be coming our way!

Learning Goals: This course provides a core grounding in how science and technology have developed to enable the Internet of Things – in a way appropriate for any learner.  For those interested in developing further hands-on expertise in designing and developing for the Internet of Things, this course will provide a context to the discoveries and converging technologies that will springboard the next round of innovations.  After completing this course, you will be able to:

1.	Compare how the telephone system works (that is, peer-to-peer networks) with how media delivery works (that is, broadcast/multicast networks).
2.	Explain the tradeoffs between circuit switched networks (that is, dedicated resources) and packet switched networks (that is, shared resources).
3.	Tell interesting stories about key innovations that transformed the communications, entertainment and consumer electronics industries.
4.	Explain how email, YouTube, SMS, etc. work.
5.	Find resources for those wishing to do more of a “deep-dive” into the above topics.
