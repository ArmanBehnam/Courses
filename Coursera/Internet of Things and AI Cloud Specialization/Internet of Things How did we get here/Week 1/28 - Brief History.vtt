00:00:03.724 --> 00:00:10.310
So let's take a brief tour of
the history of the birth of Internet.

2
00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:15.200
The year was 1957 and
Russia launched Sputnik.

3
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.250
This caught everyone
in the US by surprise.

4
00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.460
They created
Advanced Research Projects Agency, ARPA.

5
00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:28.460
Later on, it became Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency, DARPA.

6
00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:35.752
And their goal was to create really,
really advanced technologies 10,

7
00:00:35.752 --> 00:00:41.330
15 years, down the road because they
never ever wanted to be surprised again.

8
00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.520
And one of the initiators was to build

9
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.080
a reliable communications
system from the ground up.

10
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:55.430
The networks we saw in module 1,
they did not have this.

11
00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.200
The telephony system and
the broadcast system.

12
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.910
The RF links were common
in telephony by that time,

13
00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.280
between different central offices.

14
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.350
And you could literally jam the air of
towers with the high power transmitter.

15
00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.180
There were also periods where
the network capacity wasn't enough.

16
00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.230
There would be too much congestion,

17
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:23.980
like when you have an earthquake or
a natural disaster.

18
00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.040
Certain sections of
the network would crash, and

19
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.120
you would have reduced capacity.

20
00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:35.030
Or like on Mother's Day,
there would be way too much traffic.

21
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.050
Everybody wants to call their mother,

22
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.760
and you cannot get through
the system sometimes.

23
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.470
So DARPA commissioned this work,
to do one and

24
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.890
only one thing,
that was reliable communications.

25
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.970
They needed a survivable command and

26
00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.830
control system in the face
of the Cold War era.

27
00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.160
The internet was the result.

28
00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.490
The actually came from packet
network interconnection.

29
00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:13.210
It was first coined by Vince and Bob.

30
00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:18.082
They were many other people who
contributed to the internet.

31
00:02:18.082 --> 00:02:24.050
I suggest you take 15,
20 minutes to check out this website and

32
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:30.080
there is a timeline of the people and
the significant events.

33
00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.060
It's very, very informative.

34
00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:39.580
The early contributors for the internet
were drawn from the ranks of different

35
00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.970
contractors and federally funded think
tanks and some big universities.

36
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.910
Rand corporation,
Lincoln Labs, MIT, UCLA, Bolt,

37
00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.680
Beranek and Newman,
that's called BBN now in Boston.

38
00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:02.310
And they were all given lots of funding
from the defense department and ARPA.

39
00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.070
The two key people there were J.

40
00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.120
Licklider, he was called Lick.

41
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.540
And Bob Taylor, Larry Gables.

42
00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.030
They were part of ARPA Information
Processing Technology Office..

43
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:21.310
They challenged, championed this
effort and provided funding.

44
00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.330
So the first experiment was between SRI,

45
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.420
you see Santa Barbara,
you see Los Angeles and Utah.

46
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.788
This was in 1969 and
it was called the ARPANET,

47
00:03:33.788 --> 00:03:38.120
eventually became the internet so

48
00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.410
they were able to communicate
between these locations.

49
00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:50.260
In about five years, there were many many
more sites that came onto the system.

50
00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:56.230
So how did they grow so
far, so big, and so fast?

51
00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:02.460
See, at that time, AT&T had a massive

52
00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:07.440
network of long-distance lines and,
huge number of central

53
00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.470
offices throughout the country,
from which you could lease landlines.

54
00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:18.130
So all this research centers all
involved in early internet development.

55
00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:23.660
They leased the long distance lines
from AT&T, made long distance calls, and

56
00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:29.070
never hung up so
you had the circuit always connected but

57
00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:35.170
there were multiple people using that
connection to share packet data.

58
00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:44.120
NSFNET another network at
that time funded by NSF.

59
00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:48.180
This shows the traffic in 1991.

60
00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:54.900
The backbone nodes you can see on
the top and the regional networks below.

61
00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.858
And the purple denotes zero bytes and

62
00:04:58.858 --> 00:05:03.870
the white lines are hundred billion bytes.

63
00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.280
So the network was growing enormously, and

64
00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:12.860
this whole notion of switching packets
based on the usage was catching on.

65
00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:19.840
And there has been an exponential
growth in the number of hosts and

66
00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.030
the connections.

67
00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.700
You remember the network effect we saw.

68
00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:30.410
In the first module by Metcalf.

69
00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:34.710
Now you have about a billion
hosts on the network.

70
00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:38.530
Imagine the value of this network.

71
00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:41.610
Its evident that they rely
on the Internet so much.
