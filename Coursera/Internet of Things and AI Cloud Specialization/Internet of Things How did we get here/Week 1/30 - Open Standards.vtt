00:00:03.862 --> 00:00:07.917
TCP IP is one aspect of the Internet and

2
00:00:07.917 --> 00:00:12.862
the Internet Engineering Task Force, IETF,

3
00:00:12.862 --> 00:00:18.442
is responsible for
developing the complete bits and

4
00:00:18.442 --> 00:00:24.740
pieces of the internet
that it all fits together.

5
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:30.070
This group is slightly different from
the other standards bodies in the sense

6
00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.770
it is completely volunteer based and

7
00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.580
the RFCs, request for comments,

8
00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:44.500
is essentially how IETF
double ups these protocols.

9
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.630
Anybody can write an RFC in simple,
plain text, and

10
00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:57.290
you can sign up on the IETF site to
get the RFCs that are in progress,

11
00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.990
or even the ones that are completed,
the ones that you're interested in.

12
00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:05.710
You can download them, you can alter them,
you can comment on them.

13
00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:12.040
And people implement them and once they're
sure that it's working reasonably well,

14
00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:18.640
it's not detrimental to other parts of the
network, then it gets an RFC status and

15
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:25.935
eventually after many, many,
many years It actually becomes a standard.

16
00:01:25.935 --> 00:01:29.710
So, the things that I
was describing before,

17
00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.100
the TCP IP, all of these protocols,

18
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:41.080
it's not very hard to get one of those
RFCs and they are very good, easy read.

19
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.190
If you're interested,
I highly recommend you.

20
00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:49.080
Especially if you're going
to be in the bleeding age

21
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.400
of developing Internet of things.

22
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.718
Not just using the tools
that are available.

23
00:01:55.718 --> 00:02:00.320
You would be looking at this very,
very closely.
