00:00:04.443 --> 00:00:09.693
David Sarnoff started career at Marconi,
but for

2
00:00:09.693 --> 00:00:15.069
most of his career he was
leading Radio Corporation

3
00:00:15.069 --> 00:00:18.829
of America in various capacities.

4
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:29.235
RCA went on to create NBC and
other content stations,

5
00:00:29.235 --> 00:00:33.260
and basically they brought,

6
00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.090
after successful radio business,

7
00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.734
they brought televisions to the market.

8
00:00:43.734 --> 00:00:48.670
So, they had both bought the equipment
business and also content creation.

9
00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.551
Just like AT&T,
which owned the network, and

10
00:00:53.551 --> 00:01:00.401
was also charging people for
owning their devices and using them.

11
00:01:00.401 --> 00:01:04.712
At that time, in the early/late 50s and

12
00:01:04.712 --> 00:01:10.702
early 60s in US household
people would spend about 30%

13
00:01:10.702 --> 00:01:17.310
of their household furnishing
budget on just the radios and TVs.

14
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.020
This was an extremely profitable business.

15
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.150
And all of this launched
the consumer electronics

16
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.770
with the invention of transistor radio and
portable radios.

17
00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.760
One of the interesting things here is,
as AT&T,

18
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.975
because of the government regulations and
various aspects,

19
00:01:43.975 --> 00:01:48.387
got out of the radio business,
they actually sold,

20
00:01:48.387 --> 00:01:54.027
they had a radio station working for
about 15 years in 1927.

21
00:01:54.027 --> 00:01:58.930
They gave it off to RCA at that time.

22
00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:06.740
But they kept the cables and
the landline network

23
00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:12.020
for carrying the content from
one city to another city.

24
00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:17.645
For the longest time, and
even now, all the TV stations

25
00:02:17.645 --> 00:02:23.046
basically rely on AT&T's
cables to carry content.

26
00:02:23.046 --> 00:02:27.526
So AT&T did stay in that aspect of

27
00:02:27.526 --> 00:02:33.130
the broadcast entertainment industry.
