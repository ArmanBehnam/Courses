00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:06.424
Broadcast networks are different
from one-to-one or

2
00:00:06.424 --> 00:00:10.070
peer-to-peer networks like in telephony.

3
00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.310
You create content once
at one location and

4
00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:20.120
then many people have access to it for
viewing or listening.

5
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:25.400
I think of early broadcast networks
also as circuit switch networks,

6
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.190
in the sense if you want to
listen to a different station

7
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.290
you basically tune to
a different broadcast frequency.

8
00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:41.110
So each content shares a specific channel
in which it broadcasts Information.

9
00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:47.990
So in one of the previous lessons,
we saw de Forest's vacuum tube, or triode.

10
00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.680
This was one of his most
successful inventions.

11
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.530
And he was mainly interested in radio.

12
00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.220
In fact,
he is the self-proclaimed father of radio.

13
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.380
Although he did get an Oscar award for
putting sound on films.

14
00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:15.177
So as we saw before,
he sold the patent rights for the triode,

15
00:01:15.177 --> 00:01:21.081
the vacuum tube, for
$50,000 in 1913 to AT&T or

16
00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:25.620
their proxies to deal
with his legal battles.

17
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.890
That was just for wireline use.

18
00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.000
His legal battles were not over.

19
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.620
He had a penchant for lawsuits and
legal battles, and he sold the rights for

20
00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:45.350
the vacuum tube for $190,000 in 1914, and

21
00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:52.102
all rights in 1917 to Western Electric,

22
00:01:52.102 --> 00:01:55.800
the subsidiary of AT&T.

23
00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.930
And he went with full force against
another inventor at that time,

24
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.800
Edwin Armstrong.

25
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.890
Armstrong was the inventor
of feedback loop,

26
00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.265
which essentially made the amplification
properties of the triode

27
00:02:11.265 --> 00:02:17.140
[COUGH] to act as an oscillator.

28
00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.453
And this was used for
heterodyning the main concept

29
00:02:21.453 --> 00:02:26.073
of transmitting information
in the radio broadcast.

30
00:02:26.073 --> 00:02:31.095
De Forest wanted to increase
the value of his patents, and

31
00:02:31.095 --> 00:02:36.540
he really believed that he owned
that particular technology.

32
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.770
So at that time Edwin Armstrong
was a student at Columbia.

33
00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.760
And he understood
the operation of triode much

34
00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.810
better than De Forest or anybody else.

35
00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.230
In fact, he described the operation.

36
00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:04.210
And also came up with the use cases for
heterodyne receiver and

37
00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:09.400
transmitter, which is really what
made the broadcast industry happen.

38
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.040
And he was selling his
rights to Westinghouse and

39
00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.556
RCA, and he was making really good money.

40
00:03:16.556 --> 00:03:22.286
The broadcast industry had taken off.

41
00:03:22.286 --> 00:03:30.681
By 1922, RCA had paid Armstrong
a lot of royalties and

42
00:03:30.681 --> 00:03:36.689
starts that he had become a millionaire.

43
00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:43.258
And this was when the legal
battles between De Forest and

44
00:03:43.258 --> 00:03:47.871
Armstrong were really heating up, and

45
00:03:47.871 --> 00:03:54.300
essentially they ruined
both of them financially.

46
00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:59.355
And these were some of
the documents that were

47
00:03:59.355 --> 00:04:04.822
actually used in
the 20-year court battles.

48
00:04:04.822 --> 00:04:09.431
And around this time,
actually around 1913,

49
00:04:09.431 --> 00:04:13.289
when he was beginning his work with radio,

50
00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:18.217
he met another giant in the industry,
David Sarnoff,

51
00:04:18.217 --> 00:04:22.737
who was at that time working
at Marconi Wireless.

52
00:04:25.359 --> 00:04:28.340
Sarnoff and Armstrong had, again,

53
00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:33.380
a very long tumultuous relationship for
a long time.

54
00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:39.171
Sarnoff was interested in
the inventions by Armstrong mainly for

55
00:04:39.171 --> 00:04:44.539
radio applications,
because he figured out how to actually

56
00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:49.790
make De Forest's tube work
much better than De Forest.

57
00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:53.760
He had come to the same
conclusion as AT&T did,

58
00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.670
that you did not need a gas in there,
you needed vacuum.

59
00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:04.530
And by reorganizing the amplifier
as a feedback generator,

60
00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:11.520
you could have a radio transmitter and
a receiver.

61
00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.732
So both RCA and Sarnoff and
the content and

62
00:05:15.732 --> 00:05:20.548
consumer electronics
industry benefited a lot

63
00:05:20.548 --> 00:05:25.040
from Edwin Armstrong's inventions.

64
00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:31.200
This is a picture of Armstrong and
his wife, Marion MacInnis.

65
00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:35.810
She was actually
David Sarnoff's secretary, and

66
00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:41.250
he married in 1921, and
he built a radio for her.

67
00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:50.470
The courts actually decided
in favor of De Forest for

68
00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:55.718
all the feedback and
heterodyning concepts.

69
00:05:55.718 --> 00:06:02.810
And after that, Edwin Armstrong
went on to invent FM radio.

70
00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:07.880
This was one of his most
brilliant inventions.

71
00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:12.170
So if you had a signal with,
say, a bandwidth of about 5 or

72
00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:18.770
15 kilohertz, and so
that's what you need for audio.

73
00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:26.270
In the AM transmission which is
based on the vacuum tube and

74
00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:30.450
the heterodyning principle,
this is the technique that

75
00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:36.030
RCA was using at the time for all their
radio stations and their receivers.

76
00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:40.501
You need a very small spectrum to
actually send it over the radio.

77
00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.590
In simple amplitude modulation,

78
00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:47.600
the bandwidth becomes 2 times
15 kilohertz, 30 kilohertz.

79
00:06:49.472 --> 00:06:54.910
In FM, instead of modulating the carrier,
you actually modulate

80
00:06:54.910 --> 00:07:00.790
the frequency to much higher
value as the frequency increases.

81
00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:06.280
So what this means is there is this
bandwidth expansion that is happening.

82
00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:13.950
So when you modulate a 15 kilohertz
content for transmission in FM radio,

83
00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:20.200
you go up to 75 kilohertz
in commercial effect.

84
00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:25.150
So you end up with about
150 to 200 kilohertz

85
00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:28.350
bandwidth for each radio station.

86
00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:34.902
This was very difficult with the backward
compatibility with AM radio.

87
00:07:34.902 --> 00:07:37.200
There were definitely advantages.

88
00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:41.940
It turns out that by using more bandwidth,

89
00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:45.980
you could get 27 dB of coding gain in FM.

90
00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:50.340
What that means is,
compared to the AM radio,

91
00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:55.860
the noise floor for FM is 500 times lower.

92
00:07:55.860 --> 00:08:00.540
That means you have much
clearer sound quality,

93
00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:04.310
music quality and effect compared to AM.

94
00:08:06.348 --> 00:08:11.340
For Sarnoff, the FM radio was a threat

95
00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:17.050
to the industry that he had built and
deployed.

96
00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:20.540
And of course,
you needed more spectrum for

97
00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:25.920
FM services because you could
not be compatible with AM.

98
00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:34.030
RCA did its best to stop Armstrong
from commercializing FM radio.

99
00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:40.110
Armstrong was back at Columbia,
teaching part-time by this time, and

100
00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:48.210
he was having a lot of legal battles
still with Westinghouse and RCA.

101
00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:53.060
And the battles with De Forest have pretty
much taken away a significant chunk of

102
00:08:54.270 --> 00:09:01.290
his money, so by 1954 he lost
all the wealth that he had made.

103
00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:04.580
He lost all his family wealth.

104
00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:11.900
And one evening he wore his suit,
his jacket,

105
00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:18.256
put on a hat and simply stepped out
of the window and committed suicide.

106
00:09:18.256 --> 00:09:22.950
His wife, Marion MacInnis,
after his death,

107
00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:28.770
was able to establish the ownership
of some of his patents, and

108
00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:34.590
his estate did make some money
off Armstrong's inventions.
