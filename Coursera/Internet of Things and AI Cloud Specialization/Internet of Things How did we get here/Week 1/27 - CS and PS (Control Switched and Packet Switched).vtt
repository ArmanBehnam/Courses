00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.160
So let's take a look at CS,

2
00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.600
the circuit switch domain, and
PS the package switch domain.

3
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.930
In CS, circuit switch, there is
a physical connection between Bob and

4
00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:17.400
Alice throughout the call, and

5
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.580
that goes through the central
office where they're connected.

6
00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:27.260
In the package switch domain,
there is no such central control.

7
00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.600
All the users talk over the medium

8
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.470
whenever they have some
information to communicate.

9
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.680
And the information is
broken into small packets,

10
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.320
and each packet actually carries
the control information,

11
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.040
where it is coming from, where it needs to
go, and the data that it needs to take.

12
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.820
So, if some of them are lost
in transmission, or condition,

13
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.040
the reason mechanism to
retransmit them for reliability.

14
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.520
So let's say Doug owes George $20.

15
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.420
George keeps asking Doug for
the $20 till he receives it and

16
00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.288
the transaction is completed.

17
00:01:10.288 --> 00:01:16.070
The take away here is that there
is no dedicated connection

18
00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.216
between George and Doug during
this transaction of getting $20.

19
00:01:21.216 --> 00:01:26.734
A simple way

20
00:01:26.734 --> 00:01:33.370
to describe package
switching is this animation.

21
00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:39.290
The routing and transferring of data
by means of addressed packets so

22
00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.950
that a channel is occupied during
the transmission of the packet only.

23
00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:50.190
And upon completion, the transmission
channel is made available for

24
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.130
the traffic from other users.

25
00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.660
There are provisions for
duplicate packets, missed packets,

26
00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:05.990
by retransmission and quite often
packets would arrive at Host B,

27
00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.550
or Host 2, and
different order than intended.

28
00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:16.040
So Host 2 actually does reordering of the
packets to make the complete information.
