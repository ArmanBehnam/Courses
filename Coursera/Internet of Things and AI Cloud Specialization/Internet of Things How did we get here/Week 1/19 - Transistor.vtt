00:00:03.607 --> 00:00:07.076
One of the biggest
innovations in hardware, and

2
00:00:07.076 --> 00:00:12.321
also contributing to this convergence
of technologies that we talk about

3
00:00:12.321 --> 00:00:18.440
in the Internet of Things, was actually
the development of transistor.

4
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.720
In 1956 John Bardeen,

5
00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.510
Walter Houser Brattain and
William Shockley,

6
00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:33.720
they were given a Nobel Prize in Physics
for the invention of the transistor.

7
00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:41.720
Since then integrated circuit
design evolved significantly and

8
00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.090
the computational power
kept growing exponentially.

9
00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.316
This is a 1960s/70s computer,

10
00:00:50.316 --> 00:00:53.870
PDP-11, from
Digital Equipment Corporation,

11
00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.619
DEC, that still uses tapes
to store all the software.

12
00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.635
And the growth in semiconductor design and
transistors and

13
00:01:05.635 --> 00:01:13.130
microprocessors significantly
contributed to the consumer electronics.

14
00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.690
You were able to reduce the size, reduce
the cost, increase the functionality.

15
00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.620
So you have cheaper, faster and better.

16
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.280
Of course in our work,
this is a single board computer which has

17
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.470
all the processing that actually
implements the audio codec,

18
00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.360
the video codec that we just talked about.

19
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:44.820
And the communication protocols that were
based on Shannon's information theory.

20
00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.180
And you would get to play with
it during the future courses.
