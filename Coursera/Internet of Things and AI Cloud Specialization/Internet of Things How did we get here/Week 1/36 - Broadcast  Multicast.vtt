1
00:00:03.134 --> 00:00:08.232
We will briefly, look at,
how, radio and television and

2
00:00:08.232 --> 00:00:13.980
the entertainment industry,
got enabled by, the, internet.

3
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.510
I would like to got back to the, internet
protocol diagram that I showed you.

4
00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:24.830
And the idea here is the destination
address that we had before.

5
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.060
Certain number of destination addresses,
this is a 32-bit or

6
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.000
a 4-byte feed,
some of them are reserved for unicast.

7
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.460
That is, between one sender and
one receiver.

8
00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.680
This is the peer to peer, communication.

9
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.500
And some of them are reserved for
broadcast.

10
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.584
So if you use the address 255.255.255.255.

11
00:00:52.584 --> 00:00:56.950
Look at the full byte information.

12
00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.690
Each byte can go from zero to 255.

13
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.190
And when it's all ones, that's 255.

14
00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.740
And that address is used for
local broadcast.

15
00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.380
So one guy sends it only once,

16
00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.245
and everybody on that local
network would receive that.

17
00:01:16.245 --> 00:01:20.860
[COUGH] Similarly for multicast networks,

18
00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:26.450
the example would be Twitter or WhatsApp.

19
00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.410
You would have a certain number of
people who subscribe to your group and

20
00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:39.324
the message will go from one sender to
a group of multiple interested receivers.

21
00:01:39.324 --> 00:01:44.510
So I think you should realize
here that the broadcast and

22
00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:50.970
multicast services makes
sense only with UTP or IP.

23
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.100
So with respect to [INAUDIBLE] and
other things you

24
00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.740
need to have the higher
layers taking care of things.

25
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.010
One of the implications in the multimedia

26
00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:12.560
broadcast is if you have
different types of media

27
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.230
that are coming to the receiver and
that you need to synchronize them.

28
00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:18.757
Like video for instance.

29
00:02:18.757 --> 00:02:24.970
One-way video latency, you would like it

30
00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.946
to be about 200,
250 milliseconds to match the TV

31
00:02:29.946 --> 00:02:36.340
experience, and for
most of the times on the internet.

32
00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.100
The payload size for
voice traffic, or audio traffic.

33
00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.280
Is much smaller than the video traffic.

34
00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:49.430
So, just by the sheer amounts of data,
video would get there much later.

35
00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.930
But if you think about it,
how we have evolved, the light travels

36
00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.820
much faster from a distant region,
like lightning.

37
00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:04.400
And you'll see, sound coming much later.

38
00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.910
So we're kind of used to that.

39
00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:13.430
And, when we see audio lagging video,
it seems natural.

40
00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.240
But if video lacks.

41
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.650
Or audio that's extremely unnatural.

42
00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.510
So there's some tolerances,

43
00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:27.270
guidelines that you can use based on
perceptual studies that people have done.

44
00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:31.680
And also in lip reading and
developing hearing aids.

45
00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.174
So the video can lead.

46
00:03:35.174 --> 00:03:40.692
Audio by both 140 milliseconds,

47
00:03:40.692 --> 00:03:46.566
but it can lag only by 80 milliseconds

48
00:03:46.566 --> 00:03:52.800
before you start seeing this disparity.

49
00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.400
You want them to feel that.

50
00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:03.910
These two data streams that you
are presenting are part of one event.

51
00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:08.769
The similar thing is for
if you're [INAUDIBLE] video games,

52
00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:12.140
or to be played over the network.

53
00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.030
If you have, let's say, a car crash, and

54
00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:20.230
you would like to play a sound, and
you would also like to make a rumble.

55
00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.390
In your joystick.

56
00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:27.360
If that skew between these
two events is plus or

57
00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:33.560
minus 25 milliseconds,
you will see them as two different events.

58
00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:39.010
Unfortunately as people get older
this is more like 50 milliseconds but

59
00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:40.360
for young adults.

60
00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.852
That's about the rate,
that you would want to keep, so,

61
00:04:43.852 --> 00:04:49.660
keeping all kinds of multi-media,
or the internet.

62
00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:54.580
Not just voice, not just, videos and

63
00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.606
the reliable services like text,
webpages, so,

64
00:04:59.606 --> 00:05:06.750
the Internet has made all of these things

65
00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:11.500
very seamlessly possible for
all kinds of data.

66
00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.390
And because of this, the.

67
00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:24.410
You see a lot of traditional broadcast

68
00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.300
giants being replaced by
some of the newcomers.

69
00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:35.070
For video services you have Netflix,
Amazon Prime, and

70
00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:42.910
you can just attach a small device
like Roku and get video services.

71
00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:45.570
Similarly for audio and

72
00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:49.830
radio services, you see all
kinds of new players coming up.

73
00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:55.277
So, because the internet
has enabled all of this,

74
00:05:55.277 --> 00:06:01.810
you have a lot of newcomers coming in the
field, and lots of shifting landscapes.

75
00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:06.430
And this is one of the nice things
about the internet of things.

76
00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:11.330
You will see many, many more such shifts
happening right in front of our eyes.
