00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:07.240
One of the innovations that
really made browsing a much,

2
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:12.440
much better experience is HTML,
hypertext markup language.

3
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:18.580
The basic idea here is,
you will put control information

4
00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.570
in the data itself,
using special conventions.

5
00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:29.670
So that the renderer can take appropriate
action in highlighting animations or

6
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.790
taking some specific action that you would
want the person draws in to be able to do.

7
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:42.010
Very powerful idea, similar to what
we were doing combining control and

8
00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.450
data in the same medium.

9
00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.590
Do not want to belabor the point,

10
00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.930
you all know how that took off since
early 90s as HTML got introduce.

11
00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.900
But I do want to highlight
that there were some

12
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:03.920
unintended consequences in HTML and
other browsing technologies.

13
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.765
You can use HTML code injection, or

14
00:01:08.765 --> 00:01:14.820
cross-site scripting that can make
the devices really vulnerable.

15
00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.008
There is one other aspect
when the telephony got

16
00:01:23.026 --> 00:01:29.510
converged with the Internet,
voiceover IP, the SS7 signalling,

17
00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:34.710
also left similar
vulnerability in the service.

18
00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.460
So some of these
consequences are really bad.

19
00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:46.420
But some of them just make
things outright annoying.

20
00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.700
For example, email.

21
00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.580
You've all heard the term email spam.

22
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.954
Actually, the word spam came from
Monty Python's skit In the early 70s.

23
00:01:59.954 --> 00:02:00.540
Jimmy.

24
00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.454
Very hilarious.

25
00:02:03.454 --> 00:02:05.378
>> Morning.

26
00:02:05.378 --> 00:02:06.643
>> Morning.

27
00:02:06.643 --> 00:02:08.200
What ya got then?

28
00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.660
>> Well, there's eggs and bacon,
eggs sausage and bacon, egg and SPAM,

29
00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:19.520
egg, bacon and Spam, egg, bacon,
sausage and Spam, Spam, bacon, sausage and

30
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.185
Spam, Spam, egg Spam Spam, bacon
>> Is it Spam?

31
00:02:23.185 --> 00:02:23.980
Spam, Spam, Spam, eggs and Spam.

32
00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.340
Spam, Spam, Spam, Spam, Spam,

33
00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.630
Spam, baked beans, Spam,
Spam, Spam and Spam.

34
00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.160
Oh, and Lobster Thermidor because that's
for the Boulenaise sauce goes with

35
00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.974
truffle, pancake, brandy, and
a flagon of bottled Spam.

36
00:02:38.974 --> 00:02:40.630
[LAUGH]
>> Have you got anything without

37
00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:42.590
Spam in it?

38
00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.440
>> Well, Spam eggs, sausage and
Spam, it's not got much Spam in it.

39
00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.600
>> I don't want any Spam.

40
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.880
Why can't you have egg,
bacon, spam, and sausage?

41
00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:52.630
>> That's got spam in it!

42
00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:53.942
>> Not as much as spam,
egg, sausage, and spam.

43
00:02:53.942 --> 00:02:58.890
>> [LAUGH]
>> Look, could I have egg,

44
00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.050
bacon, spam, and sausage without the spam?

45
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.660
>> Ugh!
>> [LAUGH]

46
00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:03.580
>> What do you mean ugh?

47
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:04.330
I don't like spam!

48
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.052
>> Spam, spam, spam, spam,

Wonderful Spam!

51
00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:13.880
>> Shut up!

52
00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:14.706
Shut up!

53
00:03:14.706 --> 00:03:15.211
Shut up!
