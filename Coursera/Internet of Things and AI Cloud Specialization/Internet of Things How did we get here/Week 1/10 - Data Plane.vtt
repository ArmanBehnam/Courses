00:00:03.768 --> 00:00:08.844
The other big part is the data plane,
the physical medium

2
00:00:08.844 --> 00:00:14.710
on which voice actually gets
carried from point A to point B.

3
00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:19.088
The telephone adoption was
going like a hockey stick.

4
00:00:19.088 --> 00:00:22.712
There were 50,000 in 1890,

5
00:00:22.712 --> 00:00:27.112
and by 1910, there were 5 million lines.

6
00:00:27.112 --> 00:00:33.343
And AT&T realized very early
on that long distance was

7
00:00:33.343 --> 00:00:38.768
going to be a crucial
aspect of their business.

8
00:00:38.768 --> 00:00:46.317
In this 1891 map, you can see the red
lines showing their network and

9
00:00:46.317 --> 00:00:53.510
they wanted to cover the entire
continent with their network.

10
00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.820
But there was a problem, path loss,
that is, as you travel longer and

11
00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.392
longer distances the signal
strength on the wires

12
00:01:03.392 --> 00:01:08.720
were getting attenuated and

13
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.502
they could hardly reach
up to Chicago in 1930.

14
00:01:12.502 --> 00:01:18.630
And they really wanted to reach
up to San Francisco by 1915,

15
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.220
because the managers had
already announced that at

16
00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:31.500
the 1915 Pan Pacific Expo, they were going
to demonstrate cross continental call.

17
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.910
So, they had to solve this problem.

18
00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.670
So I take a small detour here and
show you a picture of Lee de Forest,

19
00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.790
who was invented, he was credited
with the invention of Audion or

20
00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.200
the vacuum tube that
functioned as an amplifier.

21
00:01:53.200 --> 00:02:00.350
It's called a triode, the small one watt
receiving tube is in his left hand and

22
00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:06.910
the large one, the transmitter,
is on his right hand.

23
00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:11.290
So he invented this in 1906, and

24
00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.330
he wanted to make money off his invention.

25
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.879
And he met a promoter,
Abraham White, from Texas.

26
00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:28.203
And he was his main VC, or
venture capitalist supporter,

27
00:02:28.203 --> 00:02:30.492
for the next five years.

28
00:02:30.492 --> 00:02:36.318
And this had lots of applications in
many many electronic circuits for

29
00:02:36.318 --> 00:02:40.910
amplification, oscillators, modulators.

30
00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:47.750
But, de Forest had lots of bad
luck in monetizing his inventions.

31
00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.608
He had lots of legal battles about
which we will come to in a short while.

32
00:02:55.608 --> 00:02:59.289
But, back to AT&T, Western Electric,

33
00:02:59.289 --> 00:03:04.757
which is the subsidiary of AT&T for
manufacturing phones and

34
00:03:04.757 --> 00:03:12.550
switches, realized the potential of the
vacuum tube that de Forest had invented.

35
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.070
But it had some problems.

36
00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.200
They had to redefine the circuit

37
00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.320
to make sure that it would work at
the telephone line voltages level.

38
00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.990
And they also figured out that you
had to remove the gas that de Forest

39
00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:29.236
had in the vacuum tube completely.

40
00:03:29.236 --> 00:03:33.470
And essentially,
the circuit operation became

41
00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.088
flow of electrons inside of the device,
instead of gas ions.

42
00:03:38.088 --> 00:03:45.360
And what AT&T did was they had a third
party negotiator go up to de Forest,

43
00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.759
and negotiated the rights for
using this invention for

44
00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:55.736
all wireless applications for $50,000.

45
00:03:55.736 --> 00:04:00.030
And since de Forest had
lots of legal problems,

46
00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.736
he really needed the money and
he closed the deal.

47
00:04:02.736 --> 00:04:08.640
And AT&T finished the transcontinental

48
00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:14.080
line between New York and San Francisco
eight months ahead of schedule.

49
00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.480
But they held the announcement
til the Expo started and

50
00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:23.089
gave a very nice demo with huge fanfare.

51
00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:33.718
This shows the network that AT&T had
with the long distance lines and

52
00:04:33.718 --> 00:04:39.336
with the thick lines and
the local lines covering

53
00:04:39.336 --> 00:04:45.110
pretty much the entire
network by year 1927.

54
00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:51.030
So this was a huge accomplishment and

55
00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:56.490
they had continuous growth of
subscribers throughout the country.

56
00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:03.500
And around the same time,
they also laid lines under the ocean and

57
00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:08.550
also radio towers,
to connect US and Europe,

58
00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:13.510
and you could have
transcontinental voice calls.

59
00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:19.204
This was really the dream of
Theodore Vail, the CEO of AT&T,

60
00:05:19.204 --> 00:05:25.241
and the network was growing and
getting more powerful day by day.

61
00:05:25.241 --> 00:05:30.348
And before we leave,
I would like you to see this video.

62
00:05:30.348 --> 00:05:31.927
Jimmy?

63
00:05:33.147 --> 00:05:34.481
[MUSIC]

64
00:05:34.481 --> 00:05:34.995
>> Hello?

65
00:05:34.995 --> 00:05:38.280
>> Yes, a collect call to Mrs.
Floyd from Mr. Floyd.

66
00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.970
Will you accept the charges
from the United States?

67
00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:42.328
[MUSIC]

68
00:05:42.328 --> 00:05:45.648
[SOUND] Oh, he hung up.

69
00:05:45.648 --> 00:05:48.063
That's your residence.

70
00:05:48.063 --> 00:05:50.165
I wonder why he hung up.

71
00:05:50.165 --> 00:05:53.090
Is there supposed to be someone else
there besides your wife there to answer?

72
00:05:53.090 --> 00:06:00.486
[SOUND]
>> Hello?

73
00:06:00.486 --> 00:06:02.300
>> This is United States calling.

74
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:02.865
Are we reaching.

75
00:06:02.865 --> 00:06:06.965
[SOUND] See, he keeps hanging up.

76
00:06:06.965 --> 00:06:08.200
And it's a man answering.
