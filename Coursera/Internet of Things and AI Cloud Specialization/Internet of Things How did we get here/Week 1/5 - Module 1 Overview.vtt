Hello, everyone.

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:10.030
Welcome to the specialization
on the Internet of Things.

3
00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.700
My name is Harinath Garudadri.

4
00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:19.480
As you already know, our vision of
the Internet of things is a convergence of

5
00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.100
multiple technologies.

6
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:29.370
In this module, we will be looking
at the circuit switched networks,

7
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:35.860
that is the telephony platform or most of
the wireless communications as we know.
