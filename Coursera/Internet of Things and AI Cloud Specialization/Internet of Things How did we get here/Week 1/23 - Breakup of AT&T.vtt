00:00:03.468 --> 00:00:05.600
Most of AT&T's existence,

2
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.690
they had somewhat checkered
relationship with the government.

3
00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:17.610
The government really liked and benefited
from the role that AT&T was playing,

4
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:24.570
this seamless network across the country,
definitely much better voice quality.

5
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.900
Compared to other countries,

6
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:33.270
where the telephone network was
always run by the government.

7
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.760
But here, it was always a separate,
private entity.

8
00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.910
But the government also tried
to break up AT&T many times.

9
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:51.690
In 1914 there was the Kingsbury Agreement
between AT&T and the government.

10
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.000
This meant that they had to
let the independent exchanges

11
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.520
use their long distance networks,
of course, for a price.

12
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.141
And in 1921, the Willis Graham Act,

13
00:01:07.141 --> 00:01:12.292
which essentially loosened
up the activities

14
00:01:12.292 --> 00:01:16.649
that AT&T was undertaking, going and

15
00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:21.683
purchasing all the independent exchanges.

16
00:01:21.683 --> 00:01:25.324
And what they said was,
they needed to get an approval,

17
00:01:25.324 --> 00:01:29.570
they couldn't just go willy-nilly and
buy everyone.

18
00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.868
Which was not much of an issue,
it gave Theodore Vail and

19
00:01:34.868 --> 00:01:40.169
the people who succeeded him,
his policies were pretty

20
00:01:40.169 --> 00:01:46.285
much continued all the way til
the break up of the AT&T network.

21
00:01:46.285 --> 00:01:52.396
In 1947 the Department of Justice again
tried to break up Western Electric

22
00:01:52.396 --> 00:01:57.220
because it was very big and
hugely profitable and a monopoly.

23
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:05.261
And this battle lasted about seven
years between AT&T and the government.

24
00:02:05.261 --> 00:02:10.753
And this time they agreed not to
get into computer business, but

25
00:02:10.753 --> 00:02:16.360
they could continue business as
normal again for some more time.

26
00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:24.086
One of the more surprising
decisions was by FCC in 1968.

27
00:02:24.086 --> 00:02:29.410
There was Mr. Carter in Texas who

28
00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.540
wanted to attach a wireless
transceiver to his AT&T phone, and

29
00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:40.430
he could call and talk to people
much further away in the field.

30
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.761
And, of course, AT&T sued this and

31
00:02:44.761 --> 00:02:50.090
FCC gave its verdict in favor of Mr.
Carter.

32
00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.260
What this meant was cordless phones,

33
00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.910
modems and answering machines,
all kinds of different networks,

34
00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:04.030
could actually connect
to the AT&T network and

35
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:09.005
increase the value of the service,
which was not allowed before.

36
00:03:09.005 --> 00:03:14.014
And in the mid-1970s there were other

37
00:03:14.014 --> 00:03:19.725
long distance competitors like MCI and
Sprint.

38
00:03:19.725 --> 00:03:24.272
And they didn't quite like
the tactics that AT&T was

39
00:03:24.272 --> 00:03:29.125
playing in terms of business
equitable relationships,

40
00:03:29.125 --> 00:03:35.970
the cost of the interconnection, how long
it takes to get the service rolling.

41
00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.980
They were alleged to have
been using all kinds of

42
00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.100
indirect means of excluding competition.

43
00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.750
And in 1974 there was another lawsuit,

44
00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.340
and this went on til 1982.

45
00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:59.281
And this time the argument
was to break up AT&T in 1984.

46
00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:08.040
And, after the break up they were
Regional Bell Operating Companies, RBOCs,

47
00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.460
that were doing the local business, and
AT&T still had the long distance business.

48
00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:18.361
And, of course, everybody was chasing
the wireless technologies and

49
00:04:18.361 --> 00:04:20.500
cell phones at this time.

50
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.760
So you see very,
very interesting mergers and

51
00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.300
acquisitions that happened
following the breakup.

52
00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.140
And you still see some of them happening.
