00:00:03.769 --> 00:00:08.831
As we already saw AT&T had
a huge impact on research, but

2
00:00:08.831 --> 00:00:13.685
what is really surprising
here is we usually associate

3
00:00:13.685 --> 00:00:18.850
such innovations with start ups and
small companies.

4
00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:24.000
Just look at The Lean Launch Pad
movement by Steve Blank and

5
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.570
other leaders from Silicon Valley.

6
00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.470
And one of my favorite
versions of Murphy's Law is

7
00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.380
the success of a project is inversely
proportional to the funds available.

8
00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:44.820
What is really amazing is AT&T was
a monopoly and a huge bureaucracy.

9
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.470
And while executing
the business aspects perfectly,

10
00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.010
they created and fostered innovation and

11
00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.520
research in the form of AT&T Bell Labs.

12
00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:01.480
I found this slide.

13
00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:08.725
It's got a lot more things that AT&T and
Bell Labs are credited with.

14
00:01:08.725 --> 00:01:14.608
In the 1980s, in academy conferences,
the conversations in the corridor

15
00:01:14.608 --> 00:01:20.240
were if AT&T stops publishing,
we will all have to do research.

16
00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.841
And there's still many scholars trying to

17
00:01:24.841 --> 00:01:30.336
understand how exactly AT&T
managed to pull off so

18
00:01:30.336 --> 00:01:37.891
much research being a bureaucratic and
monopolistic organization.
