Hello everyone.

2
00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.110
Welcome back to the specialization
on the internet of things.

3
00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.520
The internet of things is
a platform that resulted from

4
00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.550
the convergence of various
technologies and disciplines.

5
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.250
So far, we have looked at
circuit switched networks.

6
00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:28.590
In this module we will look at packet
switched networks used mainly for

7
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.160
data and you will see that it is also
used for voice and many other things.

8
00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.400
Before we move on I have a caveat or
disclaimer.

9
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.700
In the previous module.

10
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.170
We saw that, in an overview of
the circuit switch networks.

11
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.580
And you must have realized that
the telephone is a massive network with

12
00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.540
complex technologies.

13
00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.860
Hundreds of thousands of people
contributed to the development of

14
00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.960
the telephone network.

15
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.680
This is an ad from the AT&T
during its heydays.

16
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.890
As we move on to other technologies
that contributed to the convergence and

17
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.500
the IoT platform,
things will get even more complicated.

18
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.760
Our aim is to give you a flavor,
of different techniques,

19
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.190
technologies, and
motivate you to explore further.

20
00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.640
I'm sure some of you are already
experts in some of the disciplines and

21
00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.220
we may make some errors.

22
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.930
If you see any errors, or
if you have any suggestions

23
00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.630
to improve certain sections,
please get on the forum and

24
00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.130
tell us .We really would like to improve
the content for future learners.
