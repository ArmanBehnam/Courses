00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:01.480
Hello.

2
00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:04.790
This is Oxana Wilcox from
Qualcomm Technologies.

3
00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:09.370
I am a part of a Snapdragon and
IOE product organization.

4
00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.410
We at Qualcomm Technologies are excited
about the future of IOT Space.

5
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.330
You saw Gans describing auto,
healthcare, and

6
00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.630
smart home applications
in the previous lesson.

7
00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.810
You may have your own great ideas in
this and also other IOT verticals.

8
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.130
Well the good news is that we at Koke
have the right set of technologies in our

9
00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:35.390
portfolio to help you successfully
develop your IOT projects and our

10
00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.590
groups mission is to make some of those
technologies easily accessible to you.

11
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.910
You must have heard about
the Qualcomm Snapdragon processors

12
00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.870
that are commonly found in
millions of mobile phones.

13
00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.710
Qualcomm technologies have selected
certain chip sets from its extensive

14
00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.290
portfolio of Snapdragon processors, and

15
00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.240
included them in our
embedded computing program,

16
00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.589
which enables easy access to these
processors and associated technologies.

17
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.710
As part of this program, Snap Dragon
processor based community boards,

18
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.250
modules, or
some single board computers and

19
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.950
development kits are available for
sale from select companies.

20
00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.970
These products are available off
the shelf through online sales channels.

21
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.650
All through custom orders
through these companies.

22
00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.730
There's no need to get
an additional agreement from

23
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.520
Qualcomm technologies to procure them for
your projects or products.

24
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.010
In addition there are multiple operating
systems supported on this platforms.

25
00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.730
An extensive documentation and
training such as this USTDIOT

26
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:47.240
course available online to enable ease
of use and faster development time.

27
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.158
Software is also available for these
processors from online sources such as

28
00:01:52.158 --> 00:01:58.180
developer.qualcomm.com and
96boards.org, our community site.

29
00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.370
And finally,
to meet the IoT connectivity needs,

30
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:07.090
these processors come with WiFi,
Bluetooth, and GPS connectivity.

31
00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.100
One such example product
is DragonBoard 410c.

32
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.630
This product comes from Arrow Electronics,

33
00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.700
who are the manufacturer and
distributor of DragonBoard 410c,

34
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.230
based on one of the Qualcomm material
processors called Snapdragon 410.

35
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.860
This board could be used for evaluation,
prototyping, and development.

36
00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.120
Once you decide that Snapdragon
410 is the right processor for

37
00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.780
your commercial product, there are many
options available from providers like

38
00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.950
Arrow, eInfochips, Intrinsic,
Inforce Computing,

39
00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.470
that can be used to integrate
Snapdragon processors in your product.

40
00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:50.024
For more information on these processors,
please do this at our developer site,

41
00:02:50.024 --> 00:02:53.920
Developer.qualcomm.com.

42
00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.220
I hope you will enjoy the hands on
experience with the Dragonboard 410 C,

43
00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.130
during this specialization.

44
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.440
And we look forward to seeing exciting
Capstone projects in the very near future.
