00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:04.150
We love to talk.

2
00:00:05.738 --> 00:00:09.100
Communication, especially
voice communication and

3
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:16.560
all forms of communication, are very, very
important aspect of the human society.

4
00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:26.420
The main purpose of language is to
communicate between two people.

5
00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.007
On this slide,
I would like to pause a little bit and

6
00:00:30.007 --> 00:00:34.192
just read through the linguistic
definition of language.

7
00:00:42.215 --> 00:00:49.112
So the main point here is
language is unique to humans and

8
00:00:49.112 --> 00:00:55.890
it has evolved over 50, 100,000 years ago.

9
00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.700
One school of thought to which I subscribe
to is that language evolution had

10
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.850
a significant boost when we
started inventing tools and

11
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.400
we became hunters and gatherers.

12
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.640
This was a hands-busy,
eyes-busy situation.

13
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.610
You needed some way of
communicating with each other for

14
00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.160
efficient hunting and gathering.

15
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.047
And for the longest time,
we were passing on knowledge

16
00:01:28.047 --> 00:01:32.234
to the next generations
through word of mouth.

17
00:01:32.234 --> 00:01:39.620
And in 1454 there was the invention
of the printing press.

18
00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.130
And this was a big technological
innovation because

19
00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.000
humans could have essentially
a broadcast network.

20
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.660
You could write once and reach hundreds
of thousands or millions of people.

21
00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.058
Again, this is a busy slide.

22
00:01:55.058 --> 00:01:58.934
Let me pause a bit and
have you read about Gutenberg and

23
00:01:58.934 --> 00:02:01.703
his invention of the printing press.

24
00:02:09.121 --> 00:02:16.802
So when you think about it, the e-reader
is a thing that hangs off the Internet and

25
00:02:16.802 --> 00:02:24.400
that completely transformed our experience
of curling up with a good book.

26
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.980
But anyway,
I'm getting ahead of myself here.

27
00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:34.130
The real story that I wanted to convey
here is that of the telephony network,

28
00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.390
and we will get to the Internet of
things very soon in future lessons
