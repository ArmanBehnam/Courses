00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.420
Hello, everyone. Welcome to Capstone two,

2
00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:07.580
the remote healthcare monitoring system.

3
00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.280
Let us begin with a description or actually an overview.

4
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.685
So, we have the hardware requirements first,

5
00:00:14.685 --> 00:00:16.470
and then we have the description after that,

6
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.985
and then we'll describe the major components of the system,

7
00:00:20.985 --> 00:00:23.220
how it's implemented and after that,

8
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.485
we'll show a demo of the project itself.

9
00:00:26.485 --> 00:00:29.490
So here, we have hardware requirements.

10
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.950
The only thing that you'll need is a computer and the dragonboard.

11
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:37.236
The computer will act as the interface to the website that we'll be connecting to,

12
00:00:37.236 --> 00:00:46.575
and the dragon board will act as our medical device that we will be remotely monitoring.

13
00:00:46.575 --> 00:00:49.980
And then we'll go to the description.

14
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.340
Basically, it demonstrates how the cloud can

15
00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.144
connect the patient and doctor instantaneously,

16
00:00:55.144 --> 00:00:57.550
allowing for near real time analysis of data using

17
00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.920
cloud resources and feedback through normal communication channels.

18
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.080
What that means is we're going to be using

19
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.835
the dragonboard as a simulated medical device like a heart rate monitor,

20
00:01:10.835 --> 00:01:15.661
and it will stream its data to the cloud which is Amazon Web Services.

21
00:01:15.661 --> 00:01:17.450
And there, we can store the data,

22
00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.430
we can analyze the data,

23
00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.700
and then we can act on that data by sending a text or

24
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.650
an e-mail to the doctor or

25
00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.875
the patient which is the feedback through normal communication channels.

26
00:01:27.875 --> 00:01:33.110
And the real time analysis is checking those anomalies in the heart rate data,

27
00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:38.210
which could possibly be fatal or not actually fatal and

28
00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:44.450
just something that's just an irregularity but not serious.

29
00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.340
Here, we have the WaveForm Database.

30
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.995
That is the data that will be streaming to AWS.

31
00:01:50.995 --> 00:01:52.995
It comes from physionet.org,

32
00:01:52.995 --> 00:01:56.550
which is a massive database for medical data.

33
00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.670
A good thing about this data is that it has annotations of the waveforms,

34
00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.875
meaning that at certain points in the stream of like heart rate data,

35
00:02:04.875 --> 00:02:12.163
you can see where doctors have labeled where there is an anomaly or an arrhythmia.

36
00:02:12.163 --> 00:02:14.320
Another thing is that

37
00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.520
the waveform database is also really good because it has this thing called Wave,

38
00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.915
which lets you visualize the ECG data as you can see here in the picture.

39
00:02:22.915 --> 00:02:24.900
The picture itself is actually lightwave,

40
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.395
which is the javascript version,

41
00:02:26.395 --> 00:02:31.416
so that you can be used on our web browser.

42
00:02:31.416 --> 00:02:36.785
So we'll be using Amazon Web Services which is a major player in cloud computing,

43
00:02:36.785 --> 00:02:40.910
and it is used by companies such as Coursera, Yelp, and many more.

44
00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.315
We will use it to handle IoT communication,

45
00:02:43.315 --> 00:02:45.410
which is the dragonboard to the server,

46
00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.215
database management which is storing that data,

47
00:02:48.215 --> 00:02:50.480
and the Java application hosting,

48
00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.980
which is the lightwave server,

49
00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.095
lightwave application that we'll be showing.

50
00:02:54.095 --> 00:02:57.080
You will be learning how to do all these things in

51
00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.260
course three which will focus on the cloud and how to use it.

52
00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.330
Here's the implementation for the entire system itself.

53
00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:10.295
At the top, you can see the dragonboard which will be the quote unquote ECG device,

54
00:03:10.295 --> 00:03:15.200
and it will send data to the AWS IoT,

55
00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.825
STK which is just a message broker and it allows us to do

56
00:03:20.825 --> 00:03:26.150
various things such as send it to the web server and database.

57
00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.775
So it just sends it to the database stores that there, which is DNO DB.

58
00:03:30.775 --> 00:03:33.200
It also sends it to the EC2 server,

59
00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.970
which will serve a web application

60
00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:44.310
using javascript to show and visualize the data and interact with the system.

61
00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.620
So as you can see here,

62
00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:52.460
it sends it to the front using HTTP and a lightwave front end.

63
00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.887
So as the data's streaming,

64
00:03:54.887 --> 00:03:56.020
if there's no problems connected,

65
00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:00.370
it continually visualizes data and just keeps storing it.

66
00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.290
But if it sees a problem,

67
00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.025
such as a flag for an arrhythmia,

68
00:04:04.025 --> 00:04:06.910
it will send a notification to the doctor and

69
00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.665
the patient in the form of an email and text.

70
00:04:10.665 --> 00:04:15.875
And then from there, the doctor can simply just click on a link wherever he is,

71
00:04:15.875 --> 00:04:19.963
and then go to that exact point in the data to see where the problem is,

72
00:04:19.963 --> 00:04:22.910
and see for himself if he wants to act on it.

73
00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.270
Either tell the patient that's a serious problem and they should do something,

74
00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.135
or just tell them it was nothing and they don't have to worry about it.

75
00:04:29.135 --> 00:04:37.100
So from here, we'll go to the dragonboard and run the simulated device streaming to AWS.

76
00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.080
We'll just be reading a data file and then sending it to AWS.

77
00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.720
So, just go to the dragonboard,

78
00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.585
and on the dragonboard,

79
00:04:48.585 --> 00:04:54.220
we can read and see that it's the directory for the project itself.

80
00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:55.325
It has all the files,

81
00:04:55.325 --> 00:04:57.890
even the files that will be running on the web server.

82
00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:02.015
But we'll be focusing on the device.py file and just running that.

83
00:05:02.015 --> 00:05:03.855
And when we run that, it will start to stream to

84
00:05:03.855 --> 00:05:07.365
AWS all the data that we have stored here.

85
00:05:07.365 --> 00:05:14.295
And then we can go to my computer and then we can access the web server itself.

86
00:05:14.295 --> 00:05:17.488
So here is the application itself.

87
00:05:17.488 --> 00:05:21.083
This is nicely created by physionet, all of this front end.

88
00:05:21.083 --> 00:05:27.143
I did edit it and add some features specifically for this project.

89
00:05:27.143 --> 00:05:29.535
Everything else here is still the same.

90
00:05:29.535 --> 00:05:32.700
We're even using data from their database.

91
00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.995
This section here is different,

92
00:05:34.995 --> 00:05:37.610
I added heart rate 77, and major issue,

93
00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:43.565
and all clear, that's for the doctor to use and to notify the patient with.

94
00:05:43.565 --> 00:05:47.265
So here, we can see the data and we can start streaming the data,

95
00:05:47.265 --> 00:05:49.460
pressing play, and you can see here,

96
00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.503
this little A, that stands for arrhythmia and once it passes center,

97
00:05:52.503 --> 00:05:56.320
which is what we're measuring or checking the data for.

98
00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.360
As you can see here, we'll go to this tab and we'll see if we have

99
00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.653
an e-mail from AWS certification message,

100
00:06:02.653 --> 00:06:04.373
and it says, "Hello, Hari.

101
00:06:04.373 --> 00:06:06.765
We've detected a possible problem with your heart.

102
00:06:06.765 --> 00:06:09.740
Doctor Watson will notify you if you need take further action."

103
00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.470
So I just named our patient and doctor.

104
00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:14.810
So our patient's Hari, one of our instructors,

105
00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:17.285
and our doctor's just Dr. Watson,

106
00:06:17.285 --> 00:06:21.207
just because of the IBM Watson.

107
00:06:21.207 --> 00:06:24.205
And then here's the message for the doctor, for Dr. Watson.

108
00:06:24.205 --> 00:06:25.580
It says, "Hello, Dr. Watson.

109
00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:29.120
On your patient Harinath's ECG signal,

110
00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.450
we have detected a possible arrhythmia.

111
00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:31.876
To see the problem in that area,

112
00:06:31.876 --> 00:06:34.930
click on the following link."

113
00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:39.350
And as you can see here, it takes us directly in

114
00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:42.240
the waveform where it detected the problem.

115
00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:45.325
This looks exactly where we started on here,

116
00:06:45.325 --> 00:06:49.600
but that's just because we jumped on the waveform to the specific point,

117
00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.064
so that we could easily go for the demo.

118
00:06:52.064 --> 00:06:54.220
But normally, this would start at zero and it would just take

119
00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:57.025
a whole four minutes to get to the point.

120
00:06:57.025 --> 00:07:00.485
So here, it drops us exactly where you want to be.

121
00:07:00.485 --> 00:07:01.730
And just a quick note,

122
00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:04.235
it also sends a text message,

123
00:07:04.235 --> 00:07:06.980
and we'll be showing that on the device.

124
00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:11.311
So we can let it zoom in a bit.

125
00:07:11.311 --> 00:07:13.515
And you can see here at top,

126
00:07:13.515 --> 00:07:15.860
having the doctor's message and the patient's message

127
00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:19.105
sent to my phone because I don't have two phones.

128
00:07:19.105 --> 00:07:22.795
At the top, you can see it says Dr. Watson the same message and the link,

129
00:07:22.795 --> 00:07:26.827
so I can easily just click that and go to the website.

130
00:07:26.827 --> 00:07:29.715
And then the bottom is the message for the patient.

131
00:07:29.715 --> 00:07:34.600
So if I go back to the website itself on my computer,

132
00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:36.400
we can see here.

133
00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:41.380
So after the doctor has received the notification through the e-mail or the text,

134
00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:46.495
he can go to this link and then either look at this data,

135
00:07:46.495 --> 00:07:48.580
see if it's actually a problem.

136
00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:50.965
Like maybe this is too close to this and say,

137
00:07:50.965 --> 00:07:52.570
"Okay, it is a problem."

138
00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:56.035
So when the patient clicks major issue,

139
00:07:56.035 --> 00:07:58.846
and then that should send an email and a text to the patient.

140
00:07:58.846 --> 00:08:02.965
So you can see here, it just sent a text saying EMERGENCY in big capital letters,

141
00:08:02.965 --> 00:08:05.875
saying that Dr. Watson has determined that there is a serious heart.

142
00:08:05.875 --> 00:08:07.690
So this is really nice in the fact that

143
00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:09.445
you don't have to download a specific app or anything.

144
00:08:09.445 --> 00:08:10.940
You just give them your phone number,

145
00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:12.730
and then you'd just get a text on,

146
00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:16.330
which is something you normally interact with on a daily basis anyways.

147
00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:20.494
In addition, you also get an e-mail.

148
00:08:20.494 --> 00:08:24.625
Let's check here. It is oops!

149
00:08:24.625 --> 00:08:30.171
Emergency as seen.

150
00:08:30.171 --> 00:08:31.530
And then let's say,

151
00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:36.020
this is just nothing out of the ordinary and it's just not a problem.

152
00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:37.775
We can also just click all clear,

153
00:08:37.775 --> 00:08:43.075
telling the patient that they don't need to worry anymore and nothing is a problem.

154
00:08:43.075 --> 00:08:46.805
So we can see there's a new message here.

155
00:08:46.805 --> 00:08:52.200
Oops! It says, "Don't worry.

156
00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:55.745
Doctor Watson didn't see any issue. Have a great day."

157
00:08:55.745 --> 00:08:59.750
We can also go to my phone and then see that same message.

158
00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:02.900
See, there is two messages at

159
00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:05.360
the bottom and the last one is don't worry and the one on top

160
00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:10.555
has Emergency from before.

161
00:09:10.555 --> 00:09:11.830
So there we have it.

162
00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:13.792
This is the capstone two.

163
00:09:13.792 --> 00:09:19.893
This is just showing the pipeline for if you had an IoT medical device,

164
00:09:19.893 --> 00:09:22.625
and you wanted to actually use it in the real world.

165
00:09:22.625 --> 00:09:26.755
This is an application or a feature you can add to it to make it more user friendly,

166
00:09:26.755 --> 00:09:28.870
and just overall better to use.

167
00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:31.915
So take this as your inspiration

168
00:09:31.915 --> 00:09:35.510
and think about what you want to build for your own capstone.
