00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.780
So, this is our video for Capstone 1,

2
00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.860
which is centered around the sonification of movement,

3
00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.200
which is taking a persons movement in front of the camera and

4
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.295
using this to change some audio representation.

5
00:00:16.295 --> 00:00:22.875
And let us see how this works in more detail in the future slides.

6
00:00:22.875 --> 00:00:26.466
So, the first thing we want to go over is just what you would need for this project.

7
00:00:26.466 --> 00:00:28.900
So first, you need the DragonBoard to process everything,

8
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.645
you will need the power supply to power that DragonBoard,

9
00:00:31.645 --> 00:00:33.865
and you will need a keyboard, mouse,

10
00:00:33.865 --> 00:00:37.615
and monitor to interact with the DragonBoard.

11
00:00:37.615 --> 00:00:39.160
There is an important note for the monitor.

12
00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.870
It should either have its own speakers or you should have audio out on

13
00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:49.485
the monitor and have speakers to run the audio portion and actually hear audio back,

14
00:00:49.485 --> 00:00:53.963
since this is an audio changing project.

15
00:00:53.963 --> 00:00:57.965
And then, you also need a USB webcam to take in video and that will be

16
00:00:57.965 --> 00:01:03.714
the video that we would be changing the audio against or comparing it against to.

17
00:01:03.714 --> 00:01:09.295
Since we are taking video and changing audio depending on that.

18
00:01:09.295 --> 00:01:15.067
A video is just a bunch of frames of pictures and in that picture is a bunch of pixels.

19
00:01:15.067 --> 00:01:21.085
So, each sections of the picture control certain aspects of the audio.

20
00:01:21.085 --> 00:01:25.390
So, motion on the left side of the picture highlight in green controls

21
00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.640
the tempo and then motion on the right side of

22
00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.210
the video highlighted in blue controls the melody.

23
00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.335
Now, the little red box at the bottom,

24
00:01:35.335 --> 00:01:38.950
any motion detected there will control the beat and

25
00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:45.250
motion in the overall picture itself will control the volume.

26
00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.785
So, I will go over the video portions of this project which is covered in more detail

27
00:01:50.785 --> 00:01:57.100
in course five and it uses a little bit of stuff from the previous courses as well.

28
00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.195
So, the first thing it does is it takes RGB values from

29
00:02:01.195 --> 00:02:06.460
a frame and it converts every frame into grayscale values,

30
00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:12.326
which is basically converting everything to some form of gray colors instead of just RGB.

31
00:02:12.326 --> 00:02:15.577
You can think of this kind of like brightness, but it is not.

32
00:02:15.577 --> 00:02:18.108
There is a little nuance to it as well,

33
00:02:18.108 --> 00:02:19.690
but you guys get the point.

34
00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.480
So, the next part is that it takes

35
00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.310
the previous frame and the current frame and it subtracts them.

36
00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.585
So, if there was a pixel that did not have movement the subtraction would be zero,

37
00:02:31.585 --> 00:02:34.385
which means that if you look at the difference,

38
00:02:34.385 --> 00:02:38.725
the grayscale value would be zero and it would be completely black.

39
00:02:38.725 --> 00:02:43.130
But, if there was some kind of difference between them then you would see gray and

40
00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:48.000
the frame that is the difference between the previous and current frame.

41
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.745
And this is how we detect whether there was motion

42
00:02:51.745 --> 00:02:57.205
and to what extent the person moved as well.

43
00:02:57.205 --> 00:02:59.200
So, the next part is MIDI,

44
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.620
which will be covered in more detail in course four,

45
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:09.880
which is going over some kind of communication aspects of the DragonBoard.

46
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.795
MIDI is one way we can communicate audio.

47
00:03:14.795 --> 00:03:19.771
It is packaged into a binary message and it is labeled by dot mid.

48
00:03:19.771 --> 00:03:27.280
And you put this into a synthesizer and the synthesizer knows this binary message,

49
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.115
it represents audio, but I can edit some parts of it as well.

50
00:03:31.115 --> 00:03:34.132
So, I can turn off the piano parts of

51
00:03:34.132 --> 00:03:38.155
the music or I can adjust the tempo or just the volume.

52
00:03:38.155 --> 00:03:41.695
And you do not have this much freedom with file formats such as MP3 because

53
00:03:41.695 --> 00:03:46.765
MP3 is just one music file and that is all it is.

54
00:03:46.765 --> 00:03:49.007
But, this like binary message.

55
00:03:49.007 --> 00:03:54.655
So you can just change individual parts of the message itself.

56
00:03:54.655 --> 00:03:58.990
And then the next part is how we took the video parts and the audio parts

57
00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:03.654
and put them together to complete this program.

58
00:04:03.654 --> 00:04:06.670
The first thing we did was we made it so that

59
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:12.185
the difference between the two frames so as how to grayscale

60
00:04:12.185 --> 00:04:16.480
value up to a certain threshold because if you barely

61
00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.910
moved into frame or like some dust moved into frame as well,

62
00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:28.448
this should not cost the music to change because the amount of movement was insufficient.

63
00:04:28.448 --> 00:04:35.985
So, we had the person reach a certain threshold of movement before it affected anything.

64
00:04:35.985 --> 00:04:44.695
Afterwards, we saw how much changed in the overall frame and how many pixels had reached

65
00:04:44.695 --> 00:04:52.390
that much threshold and if there were a lot of pixels that changed from

66
00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:56.325
the previous image then we would make it so that it would change

67
00:04:56.325 --> 00:05:01.903
volume but if there is like a normal amount of movement,

68
00:05:01.903 --> 00:05:06.610
we just said this value is considered

69
00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:12.490
normal movement then we would just maintain volume at 50 percent.

70
00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.545
Afterwards, we adjusted tempo discretely.

71
00:05:15.545 --> 00:05:20.290
So, in the picture where we showed the diagram by a grid,

72
00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:25.985
you saw that the tempo was shown in like a shade of green.

73
00:05:25.985 --> 00:05:32.420
So, each shade of green means that is how much the tempo was at that point.

74
00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:33.420
So, if you moved into

75
00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:42.620
upper left hand corner

76
00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:50.120
of your frame then that means that the tempo would increase to the maximum level.

77
00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:55.540
If you just placed your hand in the bottom left hand corner then it would slow down.

78
00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:56.915
We will demonstrate this later.

79
00:05:56.915 --> 00:06:02.090
We just made it so that each tempo box had

80
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:08.094
a discrete amount of tempo difference instead of changing continuously.

81
00:06:08.094 --> 00:06:11.990
Afterwards, we made it so that the movement in the right portion and

82
00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:18.283
the bottom portion just turned on or off the melody and beat respectively.

83
00:06:18.283 --> 00:06:26.570
So, there was not like a degree to which they showed in the audio,

84
00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:29.927
its is just it is on or it is off.

85
00:06:29.927 --> 00:06:37.460
And afterwards, we will show you a quick demo of how this works in person.

86
00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:41.395
Simon will be showing us how it is done.

87
00:06:41.395 --> 00:06:45.366
So, let us get on to our demo of Capstone

88
00:06:45.366 --> 00:06:47.330
1 and we are going to have Simon demonstrate

89
00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:50.340
how it works and I will just narrate over it.

90
00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:53.695
So let us start off the program.

91
00:06:53.695 --> 00:07:01.010
It will take a moment to load.

92
00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:04.160
So as you start off,

93
00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:08.545
the sound starts playing but you cannot hear the melody anymore.

94
00:07:08.545 --> 00:07:10.328
Just ignore the blue circle in the middle,

95
00:07:10.328 --> 00:07:12.164
that was specific for me,

96
00:07:12.164 --> 00:07:17.500
just to see where I should be positioned but if Simon starts moving his right hand,

97
00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:22.911
you will see that the melody starts playing again.

98
00:07:22.911 --> 00:07:29.637
Let us have Simon stop moving his right hand and the music stops playing.

99
00:07:29.637 --> 00:07:37.104
So, let us have Simon put on his left hand at the very top left hand corner.

100
00:07:37.104 --> 00:07:40.657
Let us have him stop doing that and then let us

101
00:07:40.657 --> 00:07:44.830
have him start moving his right hand again.

102
00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:50.393
You can see that the music is significantly faster now.

103
00:07:50.393 --> 00:07:56.080
And let us have Simon move his hand to the bottom left hand corner

104
00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:03.626
now and then start moving his right hand.

105
00:08:03.626 --> 00:08:08.123
You can see that the music is significantly slower now.

106
00:08:08.123 --> 00:08:14.070
Let us have Simon start moving his legs.

107
00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:17.589
You can see that the beats start playing now.

108
00:08:17.589 --> 00:08:26.885
Let us have Simon just move a lot on the camera so that the volume increases.

109
00:08:26.885 --> 00:08:32.650
You can see that the volume gradually increases but if Simon moves a lot more,

110
00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:39.526
we can see that the volume will increase significantly.

111
00:08:39.526 --> 00:08:44.245
So, Simon has basically reached the maximum volume levels.

112
00:08:44.245 --> 00:08:47.200
But, if Simon stops moving like all of a sudden,

113
00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:51.990
you will see that the volume would decrease significantly as well.

114
00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:54.650
You can see that volume starts to decrease.

115
00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:57.174
So, this is the basic idea of Capstone 1.

116
00:08:57.174 --> 00:09:00.225
So, in conclusion, what this

117
00:09:00.225 --> 00:09:04.530
demonstrates is that there is a potential to help out people,

118
00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:07.090
who are having trouble with movement.

119
00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:10.470
So, it is just a fun way to have them practice

120
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:16.150
some muscle memory and to practice how they can psychologically move again.

121
00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:21.420
So, this is just an entertaining way for them to help themselves

122
00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:27.698
and it also an entertaining way to just play around with music.

123
00:09:27.698 --> 00:09:33.630
We are very excited to what you guys can create using this as

124
00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:41.200
a platform and just show us cool stuff that you can do.

125
00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:44.000
We will see you guys next time.
