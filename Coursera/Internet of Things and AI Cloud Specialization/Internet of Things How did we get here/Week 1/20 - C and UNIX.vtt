00:00:03.491 --> 00:00:08.629
There were also significant
software-related innovations and

2
00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:11.250
developments on AT&T's dime.

3
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.240
The C programming language is
one of the most popular for

4
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.720
embedded and scientific programming.

5
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.790
And in fact,
one of the most popular operating systems,

6
00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:31.120
Unix, was actually written in C.

7
00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:38.340
It's very hard to imagine fair embedded
computing would be without tools like,

8
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.940
Unix and C, and here you have Ken Thompson
and Dennis Ritchie at the White House

9
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.790
for their contributions to Unix and C.

10
00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:58.700
The Unix Operating system it's
essentially multitasking and

11
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:05.780
multiuser operating system that is
well suited for real time computation.

12
00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.730
That's why it's so useful for embedded

13
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:16.020
processors like the one that
we are going to be using.

14
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:23.320
And of course the Linux operating
system is derived from Unix and

15
00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.680
and from which the Android,
the mobile operating system, is developed.

16
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:33.275
Similarly OS X is based on Unix and

17
00:01:33.275 --> 00:01:39.385
from that you have IOS that runs
on tablets and smart phones.
