00:00:03.516 --> 00:00:09.209
One of the most significant innovations
in digital signal processing and

2
00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:13.431
computation is how to connect
the real world signals,

3
00:00:13.431 --> 00:00:18.138
which are all in analog,
to the digital world of computers.

4
00:00:18.138 --> 00:00:22.107
And this is credited to Harry Nyquist,

5
00:00:22.107 --> 00:00:29.456
who came up with the sampling theorem
at the AT&T Bell labs in 1928.

6
00:00:33.102 --> 00:00:39.737
This is a very simple way of
showing the Nyquist Theorem.

7
00:00:39.737 --> 00:00:44.335
Even though Nyquist described
this original invention as

8
00:00:44.335 --> 00:00:47.525
pulsars in the telegraph perspective,

9
00:00:47.525 --> 00:00:52.150
I want to describe this in
terms of the analog signals.

10
00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.990
So the channel bandwidth, think of it
as the signal bandwidth, for example,

11
00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.920
speech at four kilohertz.

12
00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:06.010
And essentially, what Nyquist theorem says
is, if the signal is limited to bandwidth,

13
00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:12.230
w, say four kilohertz, you need to
have at least eight kilohertz samples.

14
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:18.770
For the the maximum frequency, you need
two samples for every frequency point.

15
00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.360
And these samples need to be
spaced at equal intervals,

16
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.528
t milliseconds apart,
where t is one over two by w.

17
00:01:28.528 --> 00:01:33.290
And what is meant was if you did this,

18
00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.880
you could completely recover
the information that was there

19
00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.612
in the analog domain
in the digital domain.

20
00:01:42.612 --> 00:01:49.530
This worked, not just for audio speech
signals that are in one dimension,

21
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.810
it works for two dimensional signals and
multi-dimensional signals.

22
00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:01.790
In this, if you have the stripes
on the zebra, one centimeter take,

23
00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.680
then you need to have at least one
sample point every one centimeter.

24
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.870
Otherwise you would miss some
of the black or white stripes.

25
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.620
So, AT&T was most interested in
speech signals at that time.

26
00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:24.720
And, speech has a spectrum from
50 hertz to about four kilohertz.

27
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:31.066
And the telephony bandwidth
itself was from 300 to 3.3 KHz.

28
00:02:31.066 --> 00:02:37.210
And what this meant was you could sample

29
00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:42.950
each line, each voice call,
at eight kilohertz per sample.

30
00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:49.580
And for each sample you need about
12 bits per sample to represent

31
00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.800
faithfully, so that you would have top
quality speech in the digital domain.

32
00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.600
If had more complex signals,
let's say audio signals,

33
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:09.460
then you need much larger bandwidth
in order to get to CD quality.

34
00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:15.930
For FM quality, you need about 15 kHz,
and then for CD, you need 20 kHz.

35
00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.030
You also need many,
many more bits per sample,

36
00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:26.150
because the music content
has much wider dynamic range

37
00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:32.850
than the range of signals that we
can produce when we are speaking.

38
00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.290
For speech signals, it's roughly 70 dB.

39
00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.560
But for audio,
it's much bigger dynamic range.

40
00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:47.000
And, this is how Nyquist Theorem was

41
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.820
used for going from analog
domain into the digital domain.

42
00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:58.030
And, this gave the AT&T telephoning
network, and lots of other disciplines,

43
00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:03.850
a significant boost in how data
is processed and interpreted.
