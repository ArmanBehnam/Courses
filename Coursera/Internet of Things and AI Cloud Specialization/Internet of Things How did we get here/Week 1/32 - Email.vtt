00:00:03.322 --> 00:00:08.296
Email is the first killer
app on the internet, and

2
00:00:08.296 --> 00:00:13.040
you're all very very
familiar with the email.

3
00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:20.380
The guy who invented is Raymond Tomlinson.

4
00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.240
He was at BBN in Boston, and

5
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.570
he explains how it all came
about much better than I could.

6
00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.590
So, why don't we watch the video here and
come back?

7
00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.650
>> At first there wasn't much to do on
the ARPANET beyond transferring data files

8
00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:41.200
among its members.

9
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.390
But then a new capability was added, the
first killer application that would bring

10
00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.100
in the masses, and take the usefulness
of computer networking to a new level.

11
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.265
That killer app was email.

12
00:00:53.265 --> 00:00:56.584
[SOUND]
>> I was actually working on a mail

13
00:00:56.584 --> 00:01:00.180
program, but it was a program for
a single computer.

14
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.670
So that you could send messages from

15
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.217
yourself to another user on
the same time sharing computer.

16
00:01:06.217 --> 00:01:09.140
And I had written a couple of
programs to transfer files,

17
00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.700
and it occurred to me that since
the mailbox that I was sending

18
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.220
these messages to was nothing more than
a file, I could send that file across

19
00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.380
the network instead of keeping
it within the same machine.

20
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.080
And so I put two programs together,
modified the code a little bit,

21
00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.980
and the first email program was created.

22
00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.878
>> Tomlinson did more than
just write the code for email.

23
00:01:34.878 --> 00:01:40.652
In a keystroke, he gave the world a new
icon for the information age, the at sign.

24
00:01:40.652 --> 00:01:44.840
>> The @ sign was the most obvious choice

25
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.570
because we're talking about a user who was
at some computer, and it just made sense.

26
00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.100
>> Ironically what would become one of the
most popular applications on the internet

27
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.670
was a program Tomlinson
wrote on his own time.

28
00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.850
>> It seemed like a neat idea.

29
00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.620
Nobody was clamoring for e-mail.

30
00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.870
Our sponsor, Department of Defense, didn't
say anything about wanting to e-mail.

31
00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:11.576
My boss didn't say anything about e-mail.

32
00:02:11.576 --> 00:02:16.050
In fact, nobody said anything about
e-mail cuz the term wasn't coined until

33
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.000
several years later.

34
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.830
But it just seemed like
an interesting thing to

35
00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.510
do with a computer in the network,
and so I just did it.

36
00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.200
>> So then electronic mail became
the completely unanticipated killer app,

37
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.770
as we say, for the ARPANET.

38
00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:35.570
We went from remote login file transfer
electronic mail in a year flat or

39
00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:36.900
two years flat.

40
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.020
And then it stayed that way for 20 years.

41
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:44.720
>> Initial document in this,
so I show here a bunch of RFCs

42
00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.440
that actually improved
email in the future.

43
00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.173
The email itself works on SMTP,

44
00:02:54.173 --> 00:02:59.082
Simple Mail Transfer Protocol,

45
00:02:59.082 --> 00:03:02.600
and IMAP in some cases.

46
00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:10.244
The part that makes email a lot
more useful is multimedia,

47
00:03:10.244 --> 00:03:15.860
multipurpose internet mail extensions,

48
00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.702
that is, RFC 2405 to 2409.

49
00:03:20.702 --> 00:03:27.640
They describe mechanisms of attaching
various content to the email.

50
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.990
Zip files, JPEG images, wav sounds and

51
00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.530
different ways in which you can attach
any multimedia in the Internet.

52
00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:44.420
So, some of this, if you're interested,
it may be useful for you to look at that.
