1
00:00:03.688 --> 00:00:10.284
For the telephone to work properly
at you needed control plane and

2
00:00:10.284 --> 00:00:17.510
the evolutions that happened over the next
100 years in the telephone network.

3
00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.170
So think of this,
if Alice wants to talk to Bob,

4
00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.680
you need one line,
which is the figure that we showed you.

5
00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:32.880
If you have many, many more people and
anybody may want to talk to each other,

6
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.880
you would need a data plane,
but between each one of them.

7
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:47.700
This is a very, very inefficient scheme,
because you would need a lot of lines.

8
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.686
The costs would be extremely prohibitive.

9
00:00:49.686 --> 00:00:55.510
And what the AT&T system did

10
00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:01.590
was come up with this star network to
connect to all of the subscribers.

11
00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.420
So if Alice wants to talk to Bob,
Alice will call Ernestine,

12
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.090
who's the operator in the middle, and
Ernestine will connect Alice and Bob.

13
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.414
And if Cathy wants to talk to George,
it goes through the same thing.

14
00:01:18.559 --> 00:01:23.420
So if you had N users in the system,
you need N choose two

15
00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.970
which turns out to be N times and
minus one divided by two.

16
00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.355
Close to N square for
large values of N, to make

17
00:01:33.355 --> 00:01:39.930
connections between any given user and
any other user.

18
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.110
For a thousand people this is almost like.

19
00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.330
Half a million pairs of copper.

20
00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.982
For the start network that we just saw,
you need N plus 1 connections

21
00:01:51.982 --> 00:01:57.155
to make the system work.

22
00:01:57.155 --> 00:02:02.020
And with this innovation they just

23
00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:08.070
could not hire operators fast enough.

24
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:13.260
This had become an Achilles heel for
the growth of the network.

25
00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.044
And the next big step from manual control

26
00:02:18.044 --> 00:02:23.100
plane to an automated control plane.

27
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.950
This was invented by Strowger, who was,

28
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.130
who had an undertaking
business in a small city, and

29
00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.920
he had a competition and the competitor's
wife was actually a telephone operator.

30
00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.740
So whenever somebody called and
this operator got the call, instead of

31
00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:51.700
connecting to Mr. Strowger's business, she
would send the business her husband's way.

32
00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:57.330
And when Mr. Strowger found out about
this, he came up with this, an automated

33
00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.910
way, which is called a step-by-step
switch that would automatically.

34
00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.670
The users could connect to another
user by dialing the number.

35
00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.908
This is when the rotary
dial came in to existence.

36
00:03:11.908 --> 00:03:18.960
The next big innovation
is the cross bar switch.

37
00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:23.100
This was invented by Ericsson in Sweden,
and

38
00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.470
then refined by many,
many switch operators following that.

39
00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.890
It's organized like
a matrix with inputs and

40
00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:36.260
outputs, and at the connection point,
you just throw in a relay and

41
00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.770
make the connection between the calling
person and the called person.

42
00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:45.560
So in order to house these switches,
you had huge buildings with enormous

43
00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.610
power consumption and
really deafening noise.

44
00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.540
But at least customers
could dial both local and

45
00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.420
long distance numbers by themselves.

46
00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.700
This means that a significant number of
the bottlenecks in the control plane were

47
00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.146
slowly getting results.

48
00:04:07.146 --> 00:04:12.850
And subsequently,
the switch itself became electronic.

49
00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.260
You had transistors and

50
00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:20.500
computers that were making the connection
between the colors and call parties.

51
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:26.080
This is a DMS-100 switch,
developed by Northern Telecom in Canada.

52
00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:31.260
And this was in the 70s, and

53
00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:37.840
we start seeing the switches getting
a lot more powerful and power efficient.

54
00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.440
I would like to quickly flash
the blog diagram of this.

55
00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.040
DMS 100 switch that I got from Vickie.

56
00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.320
I don't expect you to follow this.

57
00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:53.320
My takeaway message here in showing this,
is that the central office,

58
00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.260
which housed all these switches,

59
00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:01.160
had become massive computers
with all the pros and

60
00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:06.210
cons of upgrading the functionality
by using software.

61
00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.048
We will come back to
this a little bit later.

62
00:05:09.048 --> 00:05:12.315
But before we leave this topic,

63
00:05:12.315 --> 00:05:16.793
I want to convey that
the telephone system,

64
00:05:16.793 --> 00:05:21.998
the AT&T system had become
extremely powerful and

65
00:05:21.998 --> 00:05:26.476
profitable, and
I want to convey this using

66
00:05:26.476 --> 00:05:30.836
the quintessential telephone operator,

67
00:05:30.836 --> 00:05:35.460
Lily Tomlin, acting as Ernestine, Jimmy.

68
00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:40.606
Now Mr. Vidle, it's Tomlin again.

69
00:05:40.606 --> 00:05:45.447
About this unpaid phone bill.

70
00:05:45.447 --> 00:05:48.141
Now when may we, well Mr.

71
00:05:48.141 --> 00:05:52.380
Vidle, I just don't see why
you're kicking up such a ruckus,

72
00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:54.880
when according to our files your present
bank balance plus stock, securities and

73
00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:00.856
other holdings amount to exactly 300 and,
what privileged information?

74
00:06:00.856 --> 00:06:03.440
[LAUGH] Oh, Mr. Beadle, that's so cute.

75
00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:08.330
No, Mr. Beadle,
you're dealing with the telephone company.

76
00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:14.880
For instance, now, as I look through your
income tax return for 1965, Mr. Beadle?

77
00:06:16.913 --> 00:06:17.660
Mister, hello?
Mr. Veedul?

78
00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:21.946
Mister?
[SOUND] Mr. Beadle, it's me again.

79
00:06:21.946 --> 00:06:24.073
[LAUGH] We seem to be a bit disconnected.

80
00:06:24.073 --> 00:06:27.114
Now, Mr. Beadle,
I want you to understand something.

81
00:06:27.114 --> 00:06:33.710
We are not subject to city,
state, or federal regulations.

82
00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:34.250
We are omnipotent.

83
00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:34.890
Omnipotent.

84
00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:36.356
[LAUGH] That's potent with
an omni in front of it.

85
00:06:36.356 --> 00:06:37.168
>> [LAUGH]
>> Now then, Mr.

86
00:06:37.168 --> 00:06:38.290
Beadle, when may we expect payment?

87
00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:42.896
Aww, Mr. Beadle, I'm afraid we're going to

88
00:06:42.896 --> 00:06:47.280
have to discontinue your outgoing service.

89
00:06:48.295 --> 00:06:52.660
[LAUGH]
>> And if we do not receive payment

90
00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:57.452
within ten days, we will send a large,
burly serviceman to your home,

91
00:06:57.452 --> 00:06:57.967
>> [LAUGH]

92
00:06:57.967 --> 00:06:59.064
>> To rip it out of the wall.

93
00:06:59.064 --> 00:07:00.120
>> [LAUGH]
>> I'd advise

94
00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.118
you to lock up the liquor,
he's a mean drunk.

95
00:07:01.118 --> 00:07:01.618
[LAUGH]
>> [LAUGH]
