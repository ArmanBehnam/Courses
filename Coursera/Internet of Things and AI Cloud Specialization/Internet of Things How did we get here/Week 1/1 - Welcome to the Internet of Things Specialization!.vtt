00:00:02.534 --> 00:00:08.424
Hello, welcome to the second
edition of the Internet of Things.

2
00:00:08.424 --> 00:00:09.776
As we said before,

3
00:00:09.776 --> 00:00:15.310
Internet of Things is a platform
that built on multiple technologies.

4
00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:19.710
And as technologies go,
we need to consider the printing press,

5
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.440
the telephone, and
the Internet that had huge

6
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.650
impact on humanity and
the world around us.

7
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.510
To understand why this was so,
we need to look at the things

8
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.140
that are common to these
three technologies.

9
00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:44.474
To start with, they all had meteoric race.

10
00:00:44.474 --> 00:00:48.784
[COUGH] The number of books
that were printed starting with

11
00:00:48.784 --> 00:00:54.300
the invention of the printing
press just exploded exponentially.

12
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.940
A lot of the books at
that time were Bible and

13
00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:04.030
maps that enable people to
explore the world around us.

14
00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.540
There were scientific
treatments that explained

15
00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.615
the nature around us and about ourselves.

16
00:01:12.615 --> 00:01:15.850
And you could print these at one time and

17
00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.540
share your knowledge with
millions of people around us.

18
00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:28.494
So all this led to us being able to fight
wars much better in the name of religion,

19
00:01:28.494 --> 00:01:34.075
for looking for
resources at the far ends of the corner,

20
00:01:34.075 --> 00:01:38.737
and we also learned to
make peace much better.

21
00:01:38.737 --> 00:01:45.443
And the technologies that came based on
these principles, other communication and

22
00:01:45.443 --> 00:01:50.390
consumer electronics,
they all had similar meteoric race.

23
00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.940
They were completely impervious
to recessions and when wars or

24
00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:01.660
other things happened, they only fueled
the growth of these technologies.

25
00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:07.512
And in the end,
they made everybody extremely rich.

26
00:02:07.512 --> 00:02:13.667
This is the per capita GDP
from 1000 AD till now 2000.

27
00:02:13.667 --> 00:02:21.125
And you can see the inflection point
right around the Industrial Age.

28
00:02:21.125 --> 00:02:23.996
And that's the World Wide Web, and

29
00:02:23.996 --> 00:02:30.260
we're still looking at the oncoming
growth due to Internet of Things.

30
00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.490
But in addition to all of these,
these technologies had one more

31
00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:41.130
really important thing in common,
that is communication.

32
00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.514
And to understand the power of
communication I would like to play

33
00:02:45.514 --> 00:02:49.410
a little clip from one of my
favorite bands, Pink Floyd,

34
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.943
it's called Keep Talking, Jimmy.

35
00:02:51.943 --> 00:02:55.977
[MUSIC]

36
00:02:55.977 --> 00:03:01.807
>> For millions of years mankind
lived just like the animals.

37
00:03:01.807 --> 00:03:05.484
[MUSIC]

38
00:03:05.484 --> 00:03:10.925
Then something happen which unleashed
the power of our imagination.

39
00:03:10.925 --> 00:03:12.421
We learned to talk.

40
00:03:12.421 --> 00:03:22.421
[MUSIC]

41
00:03:31.616 --> 00:03:35.441
It doesn't have to be like this.

42
00:03:35.441 --> 00:03:40.378
All we need to do is make sure we

43
00:03:40.378 --> 00:03:44.555
keep talking.
>> This is really profound.

44
00:03:44.555 --> 00:03:46.803
Let's parse each one of those.

45
00:03:46.803 --> 00:03:51.725
For million of years mankind
lived just like the animals.

46
00:03:51.725 --> 00:03:58.785
To be exact it took us about 6 million
years to learn how to walk on two feet.

47
00:03:58.785 --> 00:04:04.144
And this required us to coordinate
the visual sensory system,

48
00:04:04.144 --> 00:04:10.717
the vestibular sensory system, and
the proprioception where our ankles and

49
00:04:10.717 --> 00:04:15.760
knee muscles and
the skin at the bottom of our feet.

50
00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.250
Combining all of them to correct between

51
00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.920
the design orientation that we want
to have with where exactly we are.

52
00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:31.550
And activating the musculoskeletal
system so that we can maintain balance,

53
00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.690
so that we can walk, so that we can run,
and get away from the predators.

54
00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:43.930
This is such a complex task that over
those 6 million years our brains became

55
00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:49.400
five times bigger compared to all
mammals relative to body size.

56
00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:54.885
And with respect to the other primates,
our brains were three times bigger.

57
00:04:54.885 --> 00:04:59.659
And this happened mainly
because by walking on two feet,

58
00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:02.643
we were able to scavenge and hunt and

59
00:05:02.643 --> 00:05:07.125
gather much better food and
feed the growing brains.

60
00:05:07.125 --> 00:05:10.577
And around 50,000 years ago,

61
00:05:10.577 --> 00:05:15.029
we learned to build those
much before that, but

62
00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:21.153
around 50,000 years ago as we
were hunting and gathering,

63
00:05:21.153 --> 00:05:28.170
we were in the hands busy,
eyes busy situation much, much longer.

64
00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:35.230
And this is when we learned how
to use local communication,

65
00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:40.110
local signals to convey
more complex ideas.

66
00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:46.460
And this is where language was
born about 50,000 years or so ago.

67
00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:53.110
And this really unleashed
the power of our imagination.

68
00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:55.970
So we are the only animals

69
00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:59.520
that can walk on two feet without
the benefit of wings or tail.

70
00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:04.890
But more importantly,
language is unique to humans.

71
00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:08.479
Other living things do communicate, but

72
00:06:08.479 --> 00:06:13.308
not in the abstract way that
people define language as.

73
00:06:13.308 --> 00:06:18.700
And [COUGH] excuse me, so
this really enabled us to

74
00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:25.420
make innovations in multiple
areas including healthcare.

75
00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:30.183
We conquered infectious diseases,
chronic diseases like

76
00:06:30.183 --> 00:06:34.764
metabolic disorders,
diabetes, and acute diseases.

77
00:06:34.764 --> 00:06:40.107
We made so many improvements
in surgical intervention and

78
00:06:40.107 --> 00:06:48.060
antiseptic surgeries, antibiotics that
we were living much, much longer.

79
00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:53.640
And as we live much longer,
there is natural decline

80
00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:59.570
in our sensory systems, in our brain,
the cortical processing,

81
00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:04.520
and even our motor control systems.

82
00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:09.940
But more importantly, as you're not
able to communicate with others,

83
00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:15.510
hear what they're saying, see them,
participate in activities of daily living,

84
00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:20.070
that leads to many cognitive disorders.

85
00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:24.610
And this is where you can see that
you can almost feel the silence

86
00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:27.150
surrounding you and
you can't think straight.

87
00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:30.272
So taking the society away from us.

88
00:07:30.272 --> 00:07:34.899
We are social animals, we've been
like this for millions of years.

89
00:07:34.899 --> 00:07:39.066
And towards the tail end of our life,
due to injury or

90
00:07:39.066 --> 00:07:41.833
due to aging, that really hurts.

91
00:07:41.833 --> 00:07:44.853
And, So

92
00:07:44.853 --> 00:07:50.436
some of the examples are sensory
impairments that technology

93
00:07:50.436 --> 00:07:55.530
can do really well to compensate,
the motor skills.

94
00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:57.030
We can do a lot of things.

95
00:07:57.030 --> 00:08:03.640
And even on cognitive disorders,
we are making great innovations and

96
00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:09.060
this is [COUGH] really where it
doesn't have to be like this.

97
00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:12.390
We need to make sure we keep
that social connection and

98
00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:16.510
we keep exercising,
keep talking, and keep walking.

99
00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:19.380
And this is where the Internet of Things,

100
00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:24.160
the convergence of multiple
technologies come together.

101
00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:28.714
Specifically, we'll be talking
about circuit switched networks,

102
00:08:28.714 --> 00:08:33.114
packet switched networks,
computer telephony integration, and

103
00:08:33.114 --> 00:08:37.050
how all of these technologies
became mobile with wireless,

104
00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:41.313
all the extra sensors and apps and
features on your smartphones.

105
00:08:41.313 --> 00:08:48.890
And all of this combined is what we call
the Internet of Things, the IoT platform.

106
00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:51.949
And what does the future hold for
all of this?

107
00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:58.139
Clearly the common wisdom is
self-driving automobiles,

108
00:08:58.139 --> 00:09:03.824
machine learning and artificial
intelligence, drones, so on and so forth.

109
00:09:03.824 --> 00:09:09.082
That's really what you see when you,
Look at

110
00:09:09.082 --> 00:09:14.890
IoT applications in Google or
common media or in your school.

111
00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:22.920
The part that we are specifically
focusing on is healthcare applications,

112
00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:29.980
for hearing loss and hearing healthcare,
falls risk assessment and prevention,

113
00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:34.230
sports concussion,
mild traumatic brain injury, stroke, and

114
00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:39.790
rehab, and remote monitoring,
ECG and EEG signals.

115
00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:42.110
And also there are many,

116
00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:47.160
many subjective assessments that
the healthcare professionals use.

117
00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:51.700
And we can use the sensing
aspects of the IoT

118
00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:56.330
to make some of these
assessments more objective and

119
00:09:56.330 --> 00:10:02.250
improve diagnostics and
the way they intervene in providing care.

120
00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:08.620
So the series overview
is we have a total of

121
00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:14.730
five courses that we have significantly
changed compare to the first edition.

122
00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:17.820
The first course is how did we get here,

123
00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:22.110
a historical perspective,
very interesting on its own.

124
00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:23.285
And in the second course,

125
00:10:23.285 --> 00:10:29.210
we combined the out-of-the-box experience
with the single board computer.

126
00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:31.540
We are using Dragonboard 410c.

127
00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:36.236
And how you can connect
it to various sensors and

128
00:10:36.236 --> 00:10:39.531
actuate based on what you sense.

129
00:10:39.531 --> 00:10:45.215
And in Course-3, We talk about how to
take all of this data into the cloud and

130
00:10:45.215 --> 00:10:48.889
leverage cloud services
to send information back

131
00:10:48.889 --> 00:10:51.870
to the variable devices or the sensors.

132
00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:56.555
Course-4 is communication technologies.

133
00:10:56.555 --> 00:11:01.046
Think of it mostly as
one-dimensional signal processing,

134
00:11:01.046 --> 00:11:03.610
voice and voice over IP.

135
00:11:03.610 --> 00:11:07.900
And we also added MIDI as another powerful

136
00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:12.990
way of actuating the sound and music.

137
00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:15.900
Course-5 is multimedia technologies.

138
00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:21.399
We will be focusing a lot on cameras,
image processing and

139
00:11:21.399 --> 00:11:25.960
video processing, and

140
00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:31.460
what we hope you will be able to do
is put all of these together and

141
00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:35.440
create fantastic capstone projects.

142
00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:40.050
So to motivate you,
we will show you some examples

143
00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:45.210
of the capstone projects that
we have put together, enjoy.

144
00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:45.710
Jimmy?
