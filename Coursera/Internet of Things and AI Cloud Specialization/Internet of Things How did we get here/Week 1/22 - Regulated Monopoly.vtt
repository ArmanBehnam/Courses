00:00:03.503 --> 00:00:08.870
AT&T is known as, is considered to be,
a regulated monopoly.

2
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.138
The invention of the telephone
is credited to Graham Bell.

3
00:00:15.138 --> 00:00:18.480
But Theodore Vail,

4
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.840
the CEO of AT&T from 1907
until 1919 is credited

5
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.112
with the invention of
the Bell system itself.

6
00:00:29.112 --> 00:00:31.720
Early on, Mr.

7
00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:37.800
Vail realized the power
of the network effect.

8
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.000
This was later formalized by Bob Metcalfe,

9
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.470
who is credited with
the invention of the Internet.

10
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:51.920
Simply, the cost of laying
the network between, and nodes is n.

11
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.020
You essentially, need a piece of wire
connection between each of the two nodes.

12
00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.340
But, the value of this
network is exponential.

13
00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.390
If you have 12 nodes in the network,
as I show here,

14
00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.178
its value is 144.

15
00:01:10.178 --> 00:01:14.080
And because Mr. Bell realized this,

16
00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.670
he set up the Bell systems'
structure in such a way that

17
00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.700
he would go and buy independent operators.

18
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.100
There were lots of independent
operators as soon as

19
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.930
the telephone patent expired in 1907.

20
00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:39.130
So when he came back to AT&T,
he went on this buying spree.

21
00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.270
And his main focus was
long distance services.

22
00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.570
And he had wholly owned
subsidiary of Western Electric,

23
00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.960
that was mainly for the manufacturing.

24
00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:58.890
And in 1925, he set up Bell Labs
to do all the internal RND.

25
00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.520
And using the money that they had,
they would go and buy the independent

26
00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.860
exchanges in all profitable
metropolitan areas.

27
00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:14.291
Rural areas,
there wasn't much money to be made.

28
00:02:14.291 --> 00:02:16.450
They didn't bother.

29
00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:23.350
And, this is how he was able to build
this really powerful organization.
