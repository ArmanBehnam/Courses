00:00:03.201 --> 00:00:09.790
In the entertainment industry,
it's a cliche but content is the king.

2
00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.800
And the evolutions and

3
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:19.590
revolutions in the technology
essentially paved way for more and

4
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:26.520
more interesting and high-quality
content that was being generated by

5
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:33.050
the TV stations from Hollywood,
the rebroadcast over the TV.

6
00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.225
And some of the innovations in technology,
for example,

7
00:00:38.225 --> 00:00:43.590
[COUGH]
action replay,

8
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.270
this was really surprising to audience.

9
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.220
The announcer had to come back
the first time they used it

10
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.700
to explain to the audience that
there really wasn't another score.

11
00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.740
It was just a repetition, and now they
were able to show in slow motion so

12
00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.130
that the audience could appreciate it.

13
00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:10.470
So it took some time for
the audience to get hang of it, but

14
00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.220
the role of technology in
the sports content and

15
00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:23.380
entertainment content, it kept going for
a long, at an exponential rate.

16
00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.080
But the interesting change
is when all of this

17
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.300
is becoming available on the Internet.

18
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.730
In the Internet of things,
content plays a very significant role,

19
00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.350
as most of you already realize.

20
00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.099
In addition to the traditional TV and
radio stations,

21
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:51.660
in the age of Internet we have a lot
more players who are contributing to

22
00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:57.460
the delivery of content and
creation of content.

23
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.040
If you are interested, there is this
really nice documentary that explains

24
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.001
this really complex
play between De Forest,

25
00:02:09.001 --> 00:02:14.110
Edwin Armstrong, and David Sarnoff.

26
00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.859
I recommend taking a look at it.
