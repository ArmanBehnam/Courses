00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:07.520
We start our journey with
the invention of the telephone.

2
00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.030
Maybe when you were
a child you played with

3
00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.560
the telephone game with two
cans connected to a string.

4
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.810
So when you want to talk to someone
across the room, you have to shout.

5
00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.298
If that person is much farther away,
you have to shout louder.

6
00:00:21.298 --> 00:00:28.270
But if the person is much,
much further away, then you need a gadget.

7
00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:33.970
The tin can was the gadget that was
used long before the telephone.

8
00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:40.840
In 1875, Alexander Graham Bell is credited
with the invention of the telephone.

9
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:48.520
What was the tin can in our game of
telephone is now an electrical circuit.

10
00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.840
So I want you to understand
the context here.

11
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.450
The telegraph was a main
mean of communication

12
00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.400
around the time Bell
was doing his research.

13
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.970
He had a lot of background
in speech sciences,

14
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.900
hearing, linguistics,
and speech production.

15
00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.610
He used to do a lot of work with
deaf people in teaching them

16
00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.320
how to do lip reading and
make sign languages.

17
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:25.610
His own mother had hearing loss when
he was 12 years old, and in gatherings,

18
00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:31.700
he would hold on to her hand and translate
what people were speaking to her.

19
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.081
So his background in telegraph and

20
00:01:36.081 --> 00:01:41.217
speech sciences led him to look at ways to

21
00:01:41.217 --> 00:01:46.959
convert speech into
electrical currents and

22
00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:53.015
then the electrical
signals back into speech.

23
00:01:53.015 --> 00:01:57.093
In this circuit, you will see the first

24
00:01:57.093 --> 00:02:02.300
invention that Bell had
in one of his patents.

25
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.528
The receiver is the one that receives
the voice, and that terminology

26
00:02:07.528 --> 00:02:13.655
is still used in many hearing aid circles,
and that plays speech through the ear.

27
00:02:13.655 --> 00:02:18.570
And the sensor here is a microphone.

28
00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:25.820
The microphone senses the speech signals
and converts that into electrical signals.

29
00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.880
So now you have a sensor,
which is a microphone, and an actuator and

30
00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:36.900
a network that is able to carry
speech from the microphone

31
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.850
to the speaker over the electrical wires.

32
00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.400
So with this invention, you could talk
to people much, much further away

33
00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.320
as long as the electrical signal
did not attenuate significantly.

34
00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.840
And, of course, electrical signals carry

35
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.210
much further on a piece of
copper than acoustic signals.

36
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.736
If you don't get this concept, it's okay,

37
00:03:06.736 --> 00:03:11.805
we will come back to
this in future lessons.

38
00:03:11.805 --> 00:03:17.417
But the normal thing in those days
was when you made an invention,

39
00:03:17.417 --> 00:03:24.270
you would go around on a road trip and
show it to dignitaries and various people.

40
00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:29.350
And he did take it to London and showed it
to the Queen and a bunch of other people.

41
00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:35.420
Sir William Preece, who was the chief
engineer at British Post Office at

42
00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:40.960
that time, he thought this was
a real gimmick, a useless thing.

43
00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:46.834
Let me pause here and have you read what
Sir Preece had to say about the telephone.

44
00:04:01.738 --> 00:04:06.301
So I don't want to steal the thunder here,
but

45
00:04:06.301 --> 00:04:11.917
in about 80 years it turns out
that the telephone is able

46
00:04:11.917 --> 00:04:18.168
to do a lot of the things that
these messenger boys were doing.

47
00:04:18.168 --> 00:04:24.280
To Dr. Preece's credit, the messenger
boys could take important documents,

48
00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:29.150
bank documents, pictures,
whole bunch of things, from A to B.

49
00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:35.144
And we will see that the Internet

50
00:04:35.144 --> 00:04:39.811
is able to do all of that.

51
00:04:39.811 --> 00:04:44.776
Whenever you have a new technology,
and it is disruptive,

52
00:04:44.776 --> 00:04:49.270
it is very difficult for
people to see its value.

53
00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:54.290
And it's a real art in managing
disruptive technologies for

54
00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:59.040
the benefit of the industry or
the corporation.

55
00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.600
I highly recommend this book
by Clayton Christensen,

56
00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.730
if you're interested in these ideas.

57
00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:14.180
Before we leave, I would like to show
the background that Mr. Bell had and

58
00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:21.620
how he was so excited about inventing
the telephone using his background.

59
00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:22.734
Jimmy?

60
00:05:22.734 --> 00:05:27.492
>> I have an idea that if I could make
a current of electricity vary in intensity

61
00:05:27.492 --> 00:05:31.721
exactly as the air varies in density
when sound passes through it,

62
00:05:31.721 --> 00:05:35.820
then I could transmit sound,
even speech, telegraphically.

63
00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:40.970
>> I'm sorry, but I don't understand.

64
00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:42.650
>> I mean I could talk through a wire.

65
00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.180
>> Talk through a wire?

66
00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.884
>> Yes.
I could send a human voice as far as wires

67
00:05:47.884 --> 00:05:48.913
could be strung.

68
00:05:51.507 --> 00:05:53.360
>> Oh, but that doesn't seem possible.

69
00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:57.542
Oh, I can't believe it.

70
00:05:57.542 --> 00:05:59.120
It's talking through a wire.

71
00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:03.494
>> I guess it's crazy.

72
00:06:10.374 --> 00:06:13.740
>> Oh, when are you going to
start work on it, Mr. Bell?
