00:00:02.412 --> 00:00:06.942
So now that you have the Linaro or
the Ubuntu Image downloaded, let's go

2
00:00:06.942 --> 00:00:11.620
ahead and dive right into the screen so
we can create the path variables, so

3
00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:15.050
we can reference them more
easily in the next section.

4
00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.722
>> All right, so the first thing you wanna
do is unzip the file you just downloaded.

5
00:00:23.448 --> 00:00:25.176
And this may take a few seconds or

6
00:00:25.176 --> 00:00:27.800
a couple of minutes
depending on your computer.

7
00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.367
So with that in mind we can just chill for
a bit.

8
00:00:36.463 --> 00:00:39.600
Okay, now after it's done you want to
go ahead and open up your terminal.

9
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.835
Now the thing you want
to type in is export.

10
00:00:43.835 --> 00:00:45.980
>> Mm-hm.

11
00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.940
>> And then the next thing you want to put
in is say the name of the path earlier you

12
00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:50.660
want to use.

13
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.795
We are gonna go ahead and use LinaroImage.

14
00:00:54.795 --> 00:00:57.666
Is equal to.
So now you've go to find where you put

15
00:00:57.666 --> 00:01:02.954
unzipped the image you just
downloaded off the 96 sports website.

16
00:01:02.954 --> 00:01:10.164
In this case ours is on the desktop.

17
00:01:10.164 --> 00:01:14.980
Afterwards we're going to hit Enter and
to check if that was

18
00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:20.510
successfully done you type in
echo along with a dollar sign.

19
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.178
And then the variable name you just chose.

20
00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:30.453
>> And bam, so if there is some
errors within your variable,

21
00:01:30.453 --> 00:01:37.004
try to retype it again and check to see
where the error might have occurred.

22
00:01:37.004 --> 00:01:41.865
But after creating the path variable,
in the next section,

23
00:01:41.865 --> 00:01:47.406
Randy and I will show you how to flash
the image on to the microSD card.

24
00:01:47.406 --> 00:01:48.440
So stay tuned.
