00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:02.780
in this section,
we're gonna be going over the pros and

2
00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:05.520
cons of having Ubuntu on your board.

3
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.790
When you first go and
try to download these images,

4
00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:09.530
you'll notice that it says Linaro.

5
00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.870
Linaro is actually the Ubuntu version for
arm devices.

6
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.400
So in our cases, the Dragonboard
is an arm architecture device.

7
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.890
So therefore,
we are going to use Linaro specifically.

8
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.160
Now Ubuntu's really, really good in the
sense that it's a desktop environment, and

9
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.660
usually it's used for people who wanna
have a desktop experience or to run their

10
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.960
own web server, or FTP server,
any type of server that they can choose.

11
00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.120
And due to that,

12
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.490
there's a really really wide versatility
in a bunch of stuff that you can do,

13
00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.660
like different possible things,
you could have a web server on there.

14
00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.120
You can have it act as
a micro controller for

15
00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.950
controlling robotics, you can just have
it there for you personal gaming pc or

16
00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.223
something like that,
maybe not as powerful but.

17
00:00:53.223 --> 00:00:53.955
>> Probably not as powerful.

18
00:00:53.955 --> 00:00:55.610
>> Yeah.

19
00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.670
>> Another addition, at least we think

20
00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.880
is a good aspect of Ubuntu is that It's
not limited to a single programming tool.

21
00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:09.320
So as you may have heard from
the previous section, Android is kind

22
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.950
of limited to Java whereas Ubuntu,
because it is running a desktop server or

23
00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:20.710
a desktop environment, it could run
C Python and other tools like that.

24
00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.915
And also one down side to that
is that there's not standard or

25
00:01:25.915 --> 00:01:29.460
resulting it's kind of
more work around for you,

26
00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.040
in that simple tasks may be
a bit more difficult than usual.

27
00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.670
>> With Ubuntu you generally
have a higher learning curve.

28
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.020
But once you kind of reach
that level of knowledge,

29
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.980
then you become a big master and
you can do everything you want.

30
00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.005
But again, it takes a lot of
work to get to that point.

31
00:01:44.005 --> 00:01:47.540
Whereas with Android, it's just, you get
right into it and start programming.
