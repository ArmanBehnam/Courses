Hello everyone and welcome back.

2
00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:03.910
In this section we'll be
going over the pros and

3
00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:07.620
cons that you might experience or
at least that we thought about

4
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.170
when you run the Android operating
system on your DragonBoard 410c.

5
00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:17.940
So one of the main pros that I
think at least personally for me,

6
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.320
that I relate with is that the Android
operating system is very familiar with me,

7
00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.390
since I have it in my mobile device.

8
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.592
And additionally, I'm much more at least
confident in my Java, so if you have

9
00:00:31.592 --> 00:00:36.540
the Android operating system, you only
need to technically need to know Java.

10
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.210
>> Also with the Android,

11
00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.940
you will have a very access to a bunch of
different components, such as a camera,

12
00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.450
the media manager,
all nicely packaged into your Android SDK.

13
00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.440
So you really don't have to go out and
try and track down the specific libraries.

14
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.150
Or go through some poorly
documented API and stuff like that.

15
00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:01.250
So Android really brings in
that extra what you call it?

16
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.730
Easiness.
Not necessarily easy, but

17
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.340
just, it's a lot-
>> Straightforwardness.

18
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:05.030
>> Straightforwardness.

19
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.220
Exactly.

20
00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.320
So that's why for Android it'd be
a lot easier to just dive right in.

21
00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.110
>> Do note that there is a little bit
of loss of control and versatility.

22
00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:21.100
And what we mean by this is that it's
only specific to the Android SDK and

23
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.640
so you're limited to In terms of what
kind of things you'd be programming with.

24
00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.700
That's what we mean by the loss
of control and versatility.

25
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.780
>> Also, Android was built to be protected
against hacking and all that stuff.

26
00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.710
So if you really want to have root
control over your Android device,

27
00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.000
it's gonna take a lot of hacking
the operating system and stuff like that.

28
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.240
So generally right off the bat, you lose
a lot of control in that way as well.
