00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.661
Let's go ahead and take a look back
on lesson three and what we did.

2
00:00:02.661 --> 00:00:06.514
>> We started off by talking to
you about shorting your board, and

3
00:00:06.514 --> 00:00:08.631
how you can kind of avoid doing it.

4
00:00:08.631 --> 00:00:13.480
We wanted to talk to you about managing
the range of the DC adapter that you

5
00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.661
might choose for your board,
how it's between 6.5 volts and 18 volts.

6
00:00:18.661 --> 00:00:22.546
Don't go over it, probably won't be
getting much functionality of it if you

7
00:00:22.546 --> 00:00:25.682
go under it, but
definitely don't go over it.

8
00:00:25.682 --> 00:00:28.870
We touched-base on how you might

9
00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:33.290
disconnect the DC adapter without
powering it down appropriately.

10
00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.080
Just like any other computer,
shut down, wait for

11
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.620
the signal to die out from your screen,
and then unplug it.

12
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.681
We also talked about GPIOs.

13
00:00:41.681 --> 00:00:42.401
>> Yeah.

14
00:00:42.401 --> 00:00:44.683
So, make sure when you
look at the documentation,

15
00:00:44.683 --> 00:00:46.181
you only use the specific GPIOs.

16
00:00:46.181 --> 00:00:48.941
Don't, again,
do anything that you're not aware of.

17
00:00:48.941 --> 00:00:53.543
So I believe the GPIOs you're allowed
to use is like 902 and above,

18
00:00:53.543 --> 00:00:56.041
don't do number 611 or whatever.

19
00:00:56.041 --> 00:01:00.015
And again, you'll learn more about this
in course during on how to access these

20
00:01:00.015 --> 00:01:01.690
various GPIOs.

21
00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.809
And finally, we went over how to not
delete your partition tables which can be

22
00:01:06.809 --> 00:01:11.880
accessed somehow if you snoop around
a little going very in-depth in that.

23
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.208
And don't interrupt your flashing
process as that can cause some corrupt

24
00:01:16.208 --> 00:01:18.801
images being flashed onto your EEMC flash.

25
00:01:18.801 --> 00:01:22.223
>> In our procedure documents for
this particular lesson,

26
00:01:22.223 --> 00:01:27.190
we are going to include some of the GPIOs
that we found to be troublesome.

27
00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.855
We'll make sure to put those in there so
that you can kind of avoid those.

28
00:01:29.855 --> 00:01:30.880
[LAUGH]
>> Yeah.
