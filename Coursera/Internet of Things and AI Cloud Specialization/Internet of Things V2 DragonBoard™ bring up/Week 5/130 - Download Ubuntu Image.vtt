Hey everyone.
Welcome back, and

2
00:00:03.127 --> 00:00:07.629
we're gonna start downloading the Ubuntu
Image, which is operating system.

3
00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:14.010
>> All right, so the first thing we go
ahead and do is go to 96boards.org.

4
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.299
Next you wanna look for the blue
board on the right side over there,

5
00:00:17.299 --> 00:00:20.202
which is the DragonBoard 410c,
and you click on that.

6
00:00:20.202 --> 00:00:24.000
After you get to this page, you go
ahead and click on the downloads tab.

7
00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.912
You scroll down a bit, and
you can see right here under

8
00:00:28.912 --> 00:00:33.362
the Latest MicroSD card images,
you see the Ubuntu Image file.

9
00:00:33.362 --> 00:00:35.070
And go ahead and download that zip file.

10
00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.300
>> So as soon as we click that,
it's gonna start downloading.

11
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.600
So, let's save it on the Documents.

12
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.550
And while this is downloading,

13
00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.030
we're gonna start downloading
the Win32 Disk Imager next.

14
00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.410
And with that imager,

15
00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.920
we'll have everything we need to start
flashing the image onto the SD card.

16
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:56.970
>> So, we'll see you in the next session.
