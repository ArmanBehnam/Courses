00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:04.280
Welcome back everyone.

2
00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:09.085
It's time to look at all of
the files that you've downloaded and

3
00:00:09.085 --> 00:00:14.010
actually adjust one of the scripts
that you got inside that file.

4
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.622
So, I'm gonna pass you over to Randy here,
we're gonna look at his screen and

5
00:00:17.622 --> 00:00:19.840
we're gonna get started on this.

6
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.962
>> So, the first thing we're gonna do
is go ahead and open up your terminal.

7
00:00:22.962 --> 00:00:25.400
We're gonna need to set up a path
variable to your fastboot so

8
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.320
it's just easier to use the fastboot.

9
00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.560
>> You've actually already done this
before in a previous lesson, so

10
00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.550
follow along.

11
00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.586
>> Go ahead and type it in and
start with the word export.

12
00:00:36.586 --> 00:00:40.740
We're gonna use the variable name
fastboot, just to make things easier.

13
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.050
Then you set the path variable to
wherever your fastboot is located.

14
00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:52.580
And mine is in my
Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools/.

15
00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.610
>> In most cases when you
download the Android Studio IDE,

16
00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.150
that's where they're gonna default it, so.

17
00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.770
>> Yeah.
>> So yeah, Library/Android/sdk and then.

18
00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:03.680
>> Right there.

19
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:04.800
You get it all.

20
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:05.990
And to check if this actually worked,

21
00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.110
you just want to type in echo followed by
the dollar sign and the variable name.

22
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.890
In this case, it's fastboot so echo and

23
00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.410
we see here the export was successful so
we're ready to move on.

24
00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.940
Right here, you can see on the folders,

25
00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.780
we already unzipped the three files we
downloaded in the previous section.

26
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.304
So the first thing you wanna do is go
ahead and take these two image files and

27
00:01:32.304 --> 00:01:34.470
put them into the boot loader folder.

28
00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:37.789
>> If we can get it.

29
00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:40.000
Oh, I got it.
>> [LAUGH]

30
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.500
>> Okay, next.

31
00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.210
Okay.

32
00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.300
>> Yeah so, what he did is he took
the three files that he downloaded.

33
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:47.370
One of them was the boot loader,

34
00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:53.590
which comes with all sorts of different
executables and images inside that folder.

35
00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.580
What we wanted to do is we wanna modify
this script, which Randy's gonna show you

36
00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.970
right now and we want to include these
other two images that we downloaded.

37
00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.543
Instead of having so many steps, we're
just gonna move them into the folder and

38
00:02:06.543 --> 00:02:09.630
modify the script one time
instead of several times.

39
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.420
>> This flash whole script right here
is the script that we need to modify.

40
00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.220
So you just open it up in
your favorite text editor.

41
00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.420
We're gonna go ahead and use Vim.

42
00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.255
So we need a cd into that, cd Desktop and

43
00:02:22.255 --> 00:02:26.220
then to Ubuntu/dragonboard.

44
00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.770
And then flash all.

45
00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.140
So here's a script and go ahead and

46
00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.710
just put a dollar sign in
front of all these fastboots.

47
00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.300
>> That's why we created the path variable
and called it fastboot, all in lower case,

48
00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.740
was because we already knew that
inside this flash all script,

49
00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.500
we were gonna encounter this.

50
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.130
And by adding those dollar signs,
we are essentially pulling that path

51
00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.855
variable to execute our fastboot for
every one of those commands.

52
00:02:50.855 --> 00:02:52.240
[COUGH].

53
00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:58.070
>> Now over here in this little text
document, we have two more commands.

54
00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.370
These commands are to load the boot image,

55
00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.597
the Ubuntu OS image, and
the root file system.

56
00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.170
>> Yeah, so this is that special part that
I was just talking about a second ago.

57
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.420
Instead of running this script,
the flash-all script, and

58
00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.260
then manually inputting
both of these commands,

59
00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.060
we're just editing the script once, and
then we don't have to do these commands.

60
00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.660
So, it's gonna run everything and

61
00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.050
then it's gonna push both of these
files onto there through the fastboot.

62
00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.860
And this makes it so that it's just
one time execute, perfect, runs well.

63
00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.930
>> Right.
>> And it should all go well.

64
00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.320
>> Simple.
So go ahead and save file.

65
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:39.540
>> Yeah so, save it, just go ahead and
show them how to do that real quick.

66
00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.360
You can go find all the VIM
command if you want online but

67
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.980
we're just gonna do :wq and
get out of there.

68
00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:46.620
All right, cool.

69
00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.435
So we'll see you in the next video, where
we actually flash it all into the board,

70
00:03:50.435 --> 00:03:53.720
prep the board and get it all setup
with your Ubuntu operating system.
