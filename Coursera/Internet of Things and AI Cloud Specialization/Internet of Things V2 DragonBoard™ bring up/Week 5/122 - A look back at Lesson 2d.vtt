00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:05.820
I think it's time to take a look back at
lesson 2D to see what you've accomplished.

2
00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:12.030
Well, in this lesson we walked you
through the 96Boards.org website.

3
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.810
We showed you where to go to get
instructions and download the necessary

4
00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:22.370
files for Fastboot flashing
a Ubuntu operating system, right?

5
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:24.240
>> Afterward, we went ahead and

6
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.730
created the path variable to our
Fastboot to make things easier,

7
00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:34.390
along with altering the boot script, so we
can just boot all of the images in one go.

8
00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:34.940
>> Yeah.

9
00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.270
That was actually a really cool tip
that we were able to provide to you,

10
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.200
in order to save you some
time in this process.

11
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.550
After that we prepped the board.

12
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.510
Randy kind of showed you
everything you needed to do.

13
00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.660
Getting your DIP switches ready,
making sure it's powered off,

14
00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.140
everything that should be plugged
in including the micro USB cable.

15
00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.925
And we flashed everything over by
executing the script that we modified.

16
00:00:57.925 --> 00:01:02.445
So, I guess now you should be ready to do
all this yourself, and we look forward to

17
00:01:02.445 --> 00:01:07.415
seeing you in later sections so
we can have some fun with this.
