Hey.
In this section, we're gonna go ahead and

2
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.610
show you how to use that SD card
with the installed Android images

3
00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.260
to put the Android OS
onto the DragonBoard.

4
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.530
>> All right.
So let's pick up where we left off.

5
00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:17.350
On my screen,

6
00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.850
we can see that the operating system
has been loaded onto the SD card.

7
00:00:22.896 --> 00:00:25.780
Next, we're going to go into our file
explorer, we're going to click on

8
00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:30.940
the removable disk, the SD card that
we loaded on the operating system.

9
00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:32.690
I'm going to click on eject.

10
00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:35.910
Once the computer tells us that
it's safe to eject the device,

11
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.920
we're going to take out our SD card.

12
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.690
And next we're going to go
into our DragonBoard here.

13
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.760
And with the DragonBoard,
the first thing you need to make sure is

14
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.270
that it's completely powered-down and
there's no power going into it.

15
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:47.800
>> All right.

16
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.626
So the next thing is,
you want to flip over the DragonBoard so

17
00:00:51.626 --> 00:00:55.616
we can go ahead and change the boot
mode to boot from the SD card.

18
00:00:55.616 --> 00:01:02.487
So right here as you see, it's in
the 0110 mode, which is for the SD card.

19
00:01:02.487 --> 00:01:04.640
And you go ahead and
just flip it like that.

20
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.730
>> Yes, so it's on the upper right corner
of the back side of the DragonBoard.

21
00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.674
Once the boot switches
on the right direction,

22
00:01:12.674 --> 00:01:16.795
we're going to take our mini SD card and
we're going to put it right

23
00:01:16.795 --> 00:01:22.250
into the DragonBoard, and we're going
to start powering up the DragonBoard.

24
00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.570
And hopefully, this will start
into the installation page.

25
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.010
And here we go.

26
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.210
The installation page has popped up.

27
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.710
And we can see here that the Android for

28
00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.080
the DragonBoard 410C is the first
option here, so we're just going to

29
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.470
double click that here, and
we're going to click on, where is it?

30
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.190
Where is the mouse here?

31
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.954
>> Install.
>> Install here, yeah.

32
00:01:43.954 --> 00:01:48.190
And you're going to click on yes here,
and there we go.

33
00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.980
It's going to start flashing the Android
system onto the DragonBoard.

34
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.910
Now that the installation
has completed and

35
00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.821
on Android operating system has
been flashed onto the DragonBoard,

36
00:02:01.821 --> 00:02:06.620
a little box pops up,
I'm going to click okay here to reboot.

37
00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:11.358
And when this thing reboots,
we're going to take out the SD card here,

38
00:02:11.358 --> 00:02:15.990
and the DragonBoard will power up right
into the android operating system.

39
00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.850
And with this completed, we're going to,
we hope you enjoy how to download

40
00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.720
the Android operating system
onto the DragonBoard.

41
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.190
And now you have a fully functional
operating system on the Dragon Board, and

42
00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.460
we'll see you in the future lessons and

43
00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.210
courses, on what else you can do
with the Android operating system.
