Hello everyone and welcome to lesson 2d.

2
00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:05.920
Like the lesson before this one.

3
00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.520
We are going to teach you how to use
fastboot to flash an operating system onto

4
00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:10.540
your DragonBoard 410c.

5
00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.930
In this case, we are going to
flash the Ubuntu operating system.

6
00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.780
So we're gonna start off
by showing you where to and

7
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.050
how to download the bootloader.

8
00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.130
And the image you'll need for
the operating system.

9
00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.790
After that we're going to go ahead and
alter the boot loader script.

10
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.855
And set up some path variables to make
the flashing process much easier.

11
00:00:29.855 --> 00:00:33.090
>> .Once we've set up the path
variables and modified the script.

12
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.470
We're then going to prep
the dragon board 410c,

13
00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.380
get it ready, and
flash the operating system onto it.

14
00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.480
So we look forward to
showing you all of this and

15
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.030
hopefully it helps you learn
the flashing fast boot process.
