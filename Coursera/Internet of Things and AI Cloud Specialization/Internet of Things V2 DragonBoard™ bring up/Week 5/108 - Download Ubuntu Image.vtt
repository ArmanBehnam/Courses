00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.541
All right, so now we're gonna go ahead and
download the Ubuntu,

2
00:00:05.541 --> 00:00:09.760
also known as the Lenaro image, so we're
gonna go ahead and dive into the screen.

3
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.342
>> So you wanna go ahead and open up your
browser and then go to 96boards.org.

4
00:00:18.458 --> 00:00:22.940
And you're gonna want to click the
DragonBoard 410c that you see right there.

5
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.830
From there, there's a section downloads
at the navigation bar or navigation bar.

6
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:35.727
We're gonna go ahead and click that and
you're want to click the Lenaro,

7
00:00:35.727 --> 00:00:42.340
the Linux-based on Ubuntu image,
as Randy's about to click on.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.800
Choose the file destination
of your preference, so

9
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.480
we're gonna save ours in the desktop, and

10
00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.940
then if we go to our desktop, we'll
see that it should be available there.

11
00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.830
All right, it's currently downloading.

12
00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:01.210
So we're gonna go ahead and
let that download, and when you finish and

13
00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.420
when ours finish we'll see
you in the next section.
