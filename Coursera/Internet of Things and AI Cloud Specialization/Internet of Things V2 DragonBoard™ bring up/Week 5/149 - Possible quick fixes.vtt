00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:02.790
And welcome back.

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.090
In this section, we'll be going over some
possible quick fixes that you can kind of

3
00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:10.060
initiate to perhaps try to
get your board working again.

4
00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:12.670
So the first problem,

5
00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.210
if you have a software issue,
one way to perhaps go about and

6
00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:20.130
correcting this issue is to re-flash
the operating system onto the board.

7
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.840
Often times there might be corrupt images,
or perhaps there were

8
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.610
problems within the software application,
or things that you might have downloaded.

9
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.690
Reflashing the OS onto the board
will give you a new, clean slate.

10
00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.040
>> Now if you have hardware issues, one of
the best things to do is kind of just let

11
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.560
the capacitors drain
>> Sometimes this is because you

12
00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.310
overcharged your,
>> Mhmm.

13
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.490
>> overcharged your board wipe by
finding a higher voltage than needed.

14
00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.090
So, you kind of want to let it
sit there and let it drain.

15
00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.710
Maybe like a day and try again later.

16
00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.300
Or for some reason this works,
go ahead and take a DC jack and

17
00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.170
plug it into the DC jack and just do it in
quick succession like in and out, in and

18
00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:06.100
out and sometimes that's just enough to
get the dragon board running once more.

19
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.250
>> And lastly if none of those
are currently working for

20
00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.020
your board, you can always go ahead and

21
00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.270
buy a new dragon board,
that will definitely solve the problem.
