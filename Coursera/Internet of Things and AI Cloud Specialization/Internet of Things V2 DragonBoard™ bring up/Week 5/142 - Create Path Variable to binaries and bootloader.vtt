00:00:04.345 --> 00:00:09.035
Now that we have downloaded our file, or
I guess I should say all of the images and

2
00:00:09.035 --> 00:00:12.815
stuff that we need to flash
the operating system onto our board,

3
00:00:12.815 --> 00:00:17.365
it's time to take a look at Uker's screen
here and meet some path variables,

4
00:00:17.365 --> 00:00:21.915
which you've already learned how to do but
we're just gonna touch on again so

5
00:00:21.915 --> 00:00:25.735
that we can do everything we
need to do a little bit quicker.

6
00:00:25.735 --> 00:00:28.445
>> All right, so
when you're running on a Windows computer,

7
00:00:28.445 --> 00:00:32.845
you just wanna open up the command
prompt that comes with Windows MS DOS.

8
00:00:32.845 --> 00:00:36.610
And so once you open that up you
wanna go into your root C folder,

9
00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.690
so you're gonna go up into your C folder.

10
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.730
And what we want to do is create
a path variable that takes us

11
00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.340
straight to the fastboot.exe file.

12
00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:52.650
So the way to create a path variable in
Windows is we start off with saying set.

13
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.530
And then we're going to type in
the name of the pat variable we want.

14
00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.510
So for me, I'm going to call it fastboot,
all in lower case here, and

15
00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.490
then we're going to do equals.

16
00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:05.920
The important thing to remember here is
that the difference between Linux and

17
00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.060
Windows is that in Windows System,
you want to use the back slash,

18
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.350
not the forward slash.

19
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.420
So we're going to start off
with the Path right here.

20
00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.108
C and then under Program Files.

21
00:01:18.108 --> 00:01:22.914
Android, sdk, and you're gonna click

22
00:01:22.914 --> 00:01:27.867
on platform-tools and fastboot.exe.

23
00:01:27.867 --> 00:01:28.960
Let's make this bigger, here.

24
00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.620
.exe and now what I've done
is created a path variable

25
00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.600
that takes me straight
to the fastboot.exe.

26
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.431
So the next time I used the fastboot
variable I can go straight to

27
00:01:40.431 --> 00:01:41.770
the fastboot.exe.

28
00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:47.440
Now I'm going to show you how
to edit the flash all file.

29
00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.894
Now, the flash all file
>> The flash all file

30
00:01:50.894 --> 00:01:53.070
is what came with your boot
loader when you downloaded.

31
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.380
It was actually the first
download that you made.

32
00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.030
So inside there is a little script
that we're going to edit now.

33
00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.560
>> Yeah.

34
00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.450
So what you want to do is you want to
go into the folder that you downloaded

35
00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.270
all the boot loader, the root file system,
the boot image you want.

36
00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.990
Go into that folder and
have everything unzipped.

37
00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.280
And once you have everything unzipped,
you're going to scroll through them and

38
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.490
you're going to find something
that says "flashall." So

39
00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:17.830
you want to open that into a text writer,
you can use notepad, and I'm going to use

40
00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.409
this things called,
what am I going to use here?

41
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.860
Here.

42
00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.000
I'm just gonna use sublime text here.

43
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.350
So, as soon as you open
that little file there,

44
00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:30.730
you're gonna see a bunch of commands.

45
00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.980
It's gonna say fastboot something,
fastboot something, something.

46
00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.970
So, like I mentioned a few minutes ago,
you created a pathway we called fastboot.

47
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:44.090
So what we're gonna do is, we're gonna
go between every fastboot word and

48
00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.750
we're gonna enter the percentage sign
just like that between each one.

49
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.300
So let's see that.

50
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.450
>> Yeah.
So what the percentage sign is doing on

51
00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.470
the front and back is essentially what the
dollar sign does for the Linux version.

52
00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.930
And essentially it's allowing
you to call the path variable

53
00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.520
that he just created earlier.

54
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.960
And the reason we use
the lowercase fastboot for

55
00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.130
our path variable is cuz we
already knew that inside this

56
00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.910
script they already had it set to
the lowercase fastboot, right?

57
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.150
>> Yeah.
>> So, if we wanted to call our path

58
00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:14.610
variable x,

59
00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.650
then we could just change that fastboot
there within the percentage signs to x.

60
00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:20.960
And it'll be the same thing.

61
00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.410
>> And so what this file will do is,

62
00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.190
once you execute this file,
it'll fastboot everything in one go.

63
00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.620
You don't have to go and
fastboot flash every single file, so

64
00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.910
it makes your life a lot easier.

65
00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.552
So with that done,
we'll see you in the next video and

66
00:03:33.552 --> 00:03:35.205
show you exactly how to flash it.
