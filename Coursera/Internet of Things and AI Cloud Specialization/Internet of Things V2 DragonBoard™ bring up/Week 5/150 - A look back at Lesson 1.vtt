00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.580
Let's take a look back on
what we did in lesson one.

2
00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.430
So, first off we went ahead and
defined what a brick board was and

3
00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:11.360
differentiated between a soft brick, which
is a software issue versus a hard brick,

4
00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.820
which is a hardware issue.

5
00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.840
>> Next,
we gave you some troubleshooting tips on

6
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.164
what to do when your board is brick.

7
00:00:18.164 --> 00:00:21.990
So we told you, you wanted to take extra
precaution because it might be worse.

8
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.638
We told you that if it's a soft brick
then lights will still be turning on.

9
00:00:25.638 --> 00:00:28.400
And if it's a hardware brick then
it might be the other way where

10
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.230
lights aren't turning on.

11
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.381
>> And then finally,

12
00:00:31.381 --> 00:00:35.080
we went over some quick possible fixes
that might help your bricked board.

13
00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.790
So if you have a software issue, try and
reflashing the operating system.

14
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.460
if you have a hardware issue, try and

15
00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.584
let the capacitors drain or
just try the DC jack trick.

16
00:00:44.584 --> 00:00:50.150
Or, usually this has a 99% success rate,
go out and buy

17
00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:55.100
a new Dragonboard or check your warranty
and see if you can get something fixed.
