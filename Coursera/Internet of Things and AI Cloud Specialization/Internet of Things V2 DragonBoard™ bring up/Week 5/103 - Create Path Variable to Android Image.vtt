00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.040
So, now that you've finished
downloading the Android image.

2
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.950
Why don't we go ahead and
jump back to Randy's screen, and

3
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.660
show you how to create the path variable,
so that you can easily reference it when

4
00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.700
you're downloading, or
when you're flashing the micro-SD card.

5
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:16.340
>> All right.

6
00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.750
So, the first thing you wanna do is to
unzip the file you just downloaded.

7
00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:22.090
This will just take a second.

8
00:00:32.128 --> 00:00:34.690
>> And while that's extracting,
go ahead and

9
00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.230
open up your terminal as you
can see here in Randy's screen.

10
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.260
>> Okay, so
now we're gonna make the pathway able.

11
00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.665
So what you want to do is type in export,
we can make a path file name.

12
00:00:46.665 --> 00:00:49.270
Say could be something like AndroidImage.

13
00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:51.168
>> Very appropriate.

14
00:00:51.168 --> 00:00:53.580
>> And then you want to put equals.

15
00:00:53.580 --> 00:01:00.453
And since I downloaded the, or unzipped
the SD card image onto my desktop,

16
00:01:00.453 --> 00:01:05.592
I'm gonna go ahead and
type in desktop/dragonboard.

17
00:01:05.592 --> 00:01:09.253
And that's the file, sorry, the folder.

18
00:01:09.253 --> 00:01:14.260
And then you want to load up
the image file, which is right here.

19
00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.600
Afterwards, you wanna hit Enter and
now we have our path variable set.

20
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.370
>> Now if you wanna check to see if
you've appropriately set the image,

21
00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.878
you wanna go ahead and
type the following command, echo and

22
00:01:27.878 --> 00:01:30.850
then $, and then the variable names.

23
00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.450
So for us, it will be AndroidImage.

24
00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:34.800
And as you can see,

25
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.330
it's properly referencing the Android
image that we just downloaded.

26
00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.770
So, now that we've had the Android
image installed, in the next section,

27
00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.795
we'll show you how to flash
the image on to the MicroSD card.
