00:00:02.148 --> 00:00:03.070
Welcome everyone.

2
00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:04.330
In this section, we're gonna go ahead and

3
00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:07.540
show you how to download
the win32diskimager.

4
00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.840
So here on our laptop,
we're just gonna go ahead and

5
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:16.080
Google win32diskimager,
so we can find the file.

6
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.210
>> Type in win32diskimager and the first
link that comes up is the sourceforge.net.

7
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.520
And that's a pretty common link to
download the Win32 Disk Imager,

8
00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.600
so we're gonna trust it and click on it.

9
00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.645
And as soon as we get to this page,
we're gonna see a green box and

10
00:00:31.645 --> 00:00:33.330
we'll click on the Download.

11
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.248
>> So [INAUDIBLE],
what does the Win32 Disk Imager do?

12
00:00:36.248 --> 00:00:41.070
>> All right Randy, so the Win32 Disk
Imager is basically a tool that will

13
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.800
allow us to write image files
onto SD card or USB sticks.

14
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.620
That's pretty useful here and we're
gonna save this on our computer as well.

15
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.652
I'm just gonna click Save and
it'll start downloading.

16
00:00:52.652 --> 00:00:56.440
All right, so now that we have
the Win32 Disk Imager downloaded and

17
00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.480
we have the Ubuntu image downloaded.

18
00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.040
We now have everything we need to
start flashing the image file or

19
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.240
the operating system onto the SD card.

20
00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.060
So we'll see you in the next lesson and

21
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.050
see exactly how we're gonna flash
the image file onto the SD card.
