00:00:04.308 --> 00:00:09.556
Now in this section we would like to talk
to you about deleting your partition

2
00:00:09.556 --> 00:00:15.970
tables or flashing different programs,
operating systems, such onto your board.

3
00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:20.480
And whether it be within
your operating system or

4
00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.390
through a command prompt terminal,
there is a variety of things that

5
00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.168
could happen to your board
when it comes to that.

6
00:00:28.168 --> 00:00:32.910
>> So right of the bat, deleting partition
tables, it's kind of an interesting idea.

7
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.062
I know one time, me and

8
00:00:34.062 --> 00:00:37.421
Rob were actually messing around
with of our microcontrollers.

9
00:00:37.421 --> 00:00:41.151
And we thought we were deleting
a file off our SD card, but

10
00:00:41.151 --> 00:00:44.908
in reality we were actually
deleting partition tables.

11
00:00:44.908 --> 00:00:50.340
So sometimes you actually are given
access to the internals of your device.

12
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.470
So when you do so, make sure you don't
delete them because once you delete

13
00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.990
those partition tables,
you can't really use Flashbit or

14
00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.490
anything to go ahead and
reflash your authoring system.

15
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.080
That's actually where the rescue
image makes a really,

16
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.420
really big role,
takes on a really big role.

17
00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.640
Because the rescue image actually
repairs those partition tables, and

18
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.460
allows you to have that fast boot
connection to your EMMC flash.

19
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.530
So I guess long story short here is when
you're playing around with your board,

20
00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.080
make sure you don't do any operations
that you are not aware of.

21
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.670
So if you are trying to delete files make
sure that you are in the right location,

22
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.220
and they're the right file type,

23
00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.090
and you're just not doing
any unnecessary actions.

24
00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.880
>> It's naive of us, but
yeah just like Zara said.

25
00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.470
Right from the, right from the desktop.

26
00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:33.460
We were in Ubuntu and.

27
00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.050
>> Yeah.
>> And

28
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:35.800
we just went into one of the folders and

29
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.000
started deleting some stuff
cuz we wanted more space.

30
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.540
>> Yeah.

31
00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:39.680
>> And there you go.

32
00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.910
We deleted some partition tables, next
thing you know we reboot the board and

33
00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:44.538
it wasn't working anymore.

34
00:01:44.538 --> 00:01:48.600
On that note,
you can also mess you're board up in,

35
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.540
in a soft brick way by following all of
the instructions that we do incorrectly.

36
00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.587
So, when you're flashing your
board with an operating system, or

37
00:01:57.587 --> 00:02:02.428
any other type of item, you're actually
putting information onto your board.

38
00:02:02.428 --> 00:02:07.746
And if you are, if you all of a sudden cut
the flashing process in the middle of it.

39
00:02:07.746 --> 00:02:10.460
Well, I mean you've written some stuff and
not completed and

40
00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.490
the next thing you know you won't
be able to boot your board up also.

41
00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.500
Just because you stopped
the process in the middle.

42
00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.150
Same thing can be said if you've
followed procedures incorrectly.

43
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.900
So, if you're flashing your board with
something and you just flash one thing

44
00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.040
instead of the other, next thing you know
also it's, you're not working anymore.

45
00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.330
>> So usually that can be fixed by
just reflashing everything over again.

46
00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.400
Hopefully you didn't damage
any of the partition files or

47
00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.780
that fast boot protocol on the board.

48
00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.232
And again, if you did, that's where
the rescue image really shines in that,

49
00:02:42.232 --> 00:02:45.337
it lets you have that connection,
it repairs your partition tables.
