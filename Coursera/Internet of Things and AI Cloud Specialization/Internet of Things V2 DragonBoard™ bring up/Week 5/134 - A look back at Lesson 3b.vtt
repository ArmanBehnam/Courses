00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.060
All right so
hopefully you've successfully installed

2
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.540
the Ubuntu OS onto your DragonBoard.

3
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.080
And now we're just gonna take a look
back at everything we've done so far.

4
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.220
>> All right so the first thing we did was
we went to the 96boards.org website and we

5
00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:20.960
downloaded the Ubuntu version, the latest
Ubuntu version of the SD card install.

6
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:26.610
>> Next, we went ahead and downloaded and
installed the Win32 disk manager,

7
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.250
so we could write that image
file onto the SD card.

8
00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.940
>> And next, we took that .img file and

9
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.410
we flashed it onto the SD card
using the Win32 disk imager.

10
00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.690
>> Finally,
to wrap it all up we went ahead and

11
00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.640
installed the Ubuntu OS with that
SD Card on to the DragonBoard.

12
00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.540
>> And with all this completed
you now have a fully operational

13
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.110
Ubuntu operating system
on your DragonBoard.

14
00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.390
And there's a lot of neat things you can
do with it and so hopefully we'll see you

15
00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.950
again on the future lessons and courses
to find out what we're gonna do with it.
