00:00:03.314 --> 00:00:07.814
As promised in the introduction we told
you we would walk you through the steps in

2
00:00:07.814 --> 00:00:12.315
order to download all of the necessary
files you'll need to flash on the Android

3
00:00:12.315 --> 00:00:16.040
operating system onto
your DragonBoard 410C.

4
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.930
So to do that, we're gonna look
here at Ucrisch's screen and

5
00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.052
walk you through that process.

6
00:00:22.052 --> 00:00:22.870
>> All right so

7
00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:25.990
the first thing we're gonna do is
go to our 96boards.org website.

8
00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.350
And as soon as you go to that website
you're gonna see a blue micro controller

9
00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:31.590
on the right here.

10
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.820
You're gonna click on
the DragonBoard 410c there.

11
00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.640
And then we're gonna do a bunch of
link copying here, so I'll go slow.

12
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.380
You want to click on Downloads.

13
00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.120
And once you click on Downloads,
it's gonna take you to the file with

14
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.940
a bunch of downloads of
different operating systems.

15
00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.090
And then once you go past
the latest Micro SD card images,

16
00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.620
you're gonna see a link that's
going to take us to a Vichy page

17
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.440
that'll have the Fastboot
downloads we'll need.

18
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.360
So it's going to be right here,
the link here in green.

19
00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.670
This is going to take
us to a GitHub website.

20
00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.990
And the GitHub website will have
the Fastboot boot loader and

21
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:06.380
the boot image file,
the root.fs file, everything.

22
00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.460
So here we go.

23
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.190
We're just waiting for
the GitHub file to come on.

24
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.270
And so, now we're on the GitHub file.

25
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.940
We're going to scroll down and
you're gonna see a Table of Contents here.

26
00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.990
It's going to say install Android or
Ubuntu using Fastboot.

27
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.340
So we want to click on that link here.

28
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.590
>> There's a lot of stuff on this
Wiki page or this GitHub website, so

29
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.530
you can cruise around and

30
00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.070
see if there's anything else you'd
like to learn on our own of course.

31
00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.552
>> Yeah.
>> We're just focusing on

32
00:01:31.552 --> 00:01:33.490
flashing the Fastboot right now.

33
00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.338
>> As soon as you click on that,
it's gonna take you to the section called

34
00:01:37.338 --> 00:01:41.580
install Android or Ubuntu using Fastboot
and so you're gonna keep scrolling

35
00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.790
down until you see something that
says Install Android release.

36
00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.180
So the first thing you wanna
download is the bootloaders.

37
00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:50.460
And that's a very important file, so

38
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.130
you're gonna click on the link that
says zip located here, that one.

39
00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.110
And then we have a bunch of
more files to download, so

40
00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.170
we're gonna scroll down some more and
you see about six files here.

41
00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.900
It's gonna say boot, system.img,
user data recovery, persistent cache.

42
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.420
And you're gonna wanna download
each one of these files also.

43
00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.610
So click on it, download it, and
then once you have everything downloaded

44
00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.670
make sure you know which file
all of them are saved on.

45
00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.890
And also make sure they're
all in the same folder.

46
00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.179
And finally, have everything unzipped and
ready to go and

47
00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:23.182
we'll see you in the next video, and
show you how to create a path variable.
