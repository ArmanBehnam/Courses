00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.060
Let's now take a look back and
summarize what we learned in Lesson 2B.

2
00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.750
>> So first we downloaded the Ubuntu
image off the 96boards.com website.

3
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.060
>> And then we created the path
variable to the Ubuntu image so

4
00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.500
that when we referenced it
later it was much easier.

5
00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:20.760
>> Next, we went ahead and flashed the SD
card with the image that we downloaded.

6
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.960
>> And lastly we installed the Ubuntu or

7
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.230
Linaro onto the DragonBoard
410c using the microSD card.

8
00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.360
And with that in mind, that kind of
wraps up this lesson and hopefully

9
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.254
we were thorough and you were able to
successfully install the Linaro or

10
00:00:40.254 --> 00:00:43.243
Ubunto operating system
onto your DragonBoard,
