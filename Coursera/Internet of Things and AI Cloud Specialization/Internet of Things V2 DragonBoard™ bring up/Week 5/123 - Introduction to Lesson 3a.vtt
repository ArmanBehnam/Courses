00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:09.840
show you how to install Android onto
your DragonBoard 410c with an SD card.

5
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.550
So the first thing we're
gonna go ahead and

6
00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.850
do is download the Android Images
off the website.

the win32diskimager.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.690
This is a tool that's gonna allow us
to write the image onto the SD card.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.410
>> Afterward, we're going to flash
the microSD card with the image.

10
00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.260
>> And lastly,
we're going to take the SD card and

11
00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.660
install the Android operating
system onto the dragonboard.
