Hello everyone, and
welcome to this section.

2
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.730
So, here Randy and I will be showing you
where to download the Android Image, so

3
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.270
that you can properly flash the OS
in to your Dragonboard 410c.

4
00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.440
So, why don't we go ahead and
dive right in to Randy's screen?

5
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.650
>> All right.
So, here we go, to my home page,

6
00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.690
the 96boards.org.

7
00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:29.420
Here, this is where we're
going to download the image.

8
00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.822
So, after we reach this page,
you want to click on the Dragonboard 410c,

9
00:00:33.822 --> 00:00:34.501
this blue one.

10
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.660
And then once you get to this page,
you want to go to downloads, right here.

11
00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.957
And lastly, your going to go ahead and
click on the current,

12
00:00:47.957 --> 00:00:53.702
updated microSD card image, in this
case it's the android 5.1 Lollipop.

13
00:00:53.702 --> 00:00:56.760
You can go ahead and download that, and
I guess I'll save it to my desktop.

14
00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:01.420
And yeah.

15
00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.560
>> So after you let that finish
downloading, go ahead and

16
00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:06.940
go to the next section,

17
00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.870
where we'll show you how to create
the path variables to reference the image.
