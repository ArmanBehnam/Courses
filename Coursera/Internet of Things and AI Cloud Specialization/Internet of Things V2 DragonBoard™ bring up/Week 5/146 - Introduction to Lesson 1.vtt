Hello everyone and
welcome to Lesson 1, Bricked Board.

2
00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:09.698
In this lesson, we'll first be defining
what essentially a bricked board is,

3
00:00:09.698 --> 00:00:12.478
and the types of brick a board can have.

4
00:00:12.478 --> 00:00:14.361
[LAUGH]
>> And then we're gonna go and

5
00:00:14.361 --> 00:00:16.560
troubleshoot and
see what type of brick your board has.

6
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.500
Whether it's a software or hardware brick.

7
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.720
>> And lastly,
we'll give you some potential and

8
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.760
possible quick fixes that
might work on your board.

9
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.595
So, be on the lookout for that.
