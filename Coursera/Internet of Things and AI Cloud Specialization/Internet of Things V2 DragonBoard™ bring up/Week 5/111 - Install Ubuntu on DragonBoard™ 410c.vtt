1
00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:01.865
All right, hey there.

2
00:00:01.865 --> 00:00:07.341
We're gonna go ahead and use the SD
card with the installed Lenar image and

3
00:00:07.341 --> 00:00:13.093
install it and put it into the DragonBoard
so we can load up the OS, our new OS.

4
00:00:15.426 --> 00:00:18.660
Here we go.
Just put it in this slot right here.

5
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.200
>> And then, before we plug it in,
we want to flip a few switches to let

6
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:31.330
the DragonBoard know that we're going
to be booting through a microSD card.

7
00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.080
And, the configuration you want
that to be in would be 0110110.

8
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:41.050
So, we're gonna go ahead and
flip those switches down.

9
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.700
And once that's finished we're
going to power the board on.

10
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:51.440
Let that settle in.

11
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.935
And the board should be booting up.

12
00:00:52.935 --> 00:00:55.715
And the lights indicate as such.

13
00:00:55.715 --> 00:01:01.095
Now if we look at the screen for
the DragonBoard, you'll see,

14
00:01:01.095 --> 00:01:06.025
as opposed to the regular, depending
on which operating system you have,

15
00:01:06.025 --> 00:01:10.419
homepage, you get this installation guide.

16
00:01:10.419 --> 00:01:14.390
You're gonna go ahead and
click this install.

17
00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.250
And because we are installing a fresh OS,
we're then gonna override everything.

18
00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.670
So make sure you

19
00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.260
properly saved all of the files that you
need in an external source or something.

20
00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:32.520
You're gonna click OK and this will take
a few minutes to a few seconds depending

21
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.630
on the speed of your DragonBoard and
how fast it can read and write the data.

22
00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.472
So just sit back and relax, and
we'll wait for it to finish.

23
00:01:44.826 --> 00:01:48.445
So as you can see on the screen here,

24
00:01:48.445 --> 00:01:53.130
the OS has been successfully installed.

25
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.580
And as per the instruction, we're
gonna go ahead and remove the SD card.

26
00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.010
And then press OK.

27
00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.650
Now the screen should or

28
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.540
rather the DragonBoard should then boot
up and once it finishes booting up,

29
00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.260
it might take a few more seconds than
usual because it is a first boot up.

30
00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.485
It will be running the Lenaro or
the Ubuntu operating system.
