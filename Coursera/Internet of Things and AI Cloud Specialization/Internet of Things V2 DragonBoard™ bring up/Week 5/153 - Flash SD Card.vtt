00:00:02.963 --> 00:00:07.321
In this section, we're gonna go over
on how to flash the new image that you

2
00:00:07.321 --> 00:00:10.190
downloaded previously onto the SD card.

3
00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:11.990
Now if you haven't done so
already, go ahead and

4
00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:16.330
go back to section one and go and download
the specific rescue image you need,

5
00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.450
whether you're on Android or Linux,
before moving onto this section.

6
00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:25.260
And the most important aspect of this
section at least is having an SD card.

7
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.180
>> I think that's pretty vital.

8
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.440
>> I think so too.

9
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.370
So first what you want to do is
you want to get your SD card and

10
00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.040
you want to plug it into your computer.

11
00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.430
>> Now note, right now we're gonna
be using a Mac computer to do this.

12
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.120
Operation if you're on a Windows
computer you can go ahead and

13
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.950
use the Win32 disk imager that
we specified in section four.

14
00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:51.372
So if you need a bit of a refresher on
that, go ahead and check those videos out.

15
00:00:51.372 --> 00:00:53.410
>> All right so we're gonna go ahead and
dive right into the screen.

16
00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.240
So as you can see here,
we have the terminal open.

17
00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:02.320
And what you want to first do is
you want to issue the command mount

18
00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.640
to check to see what
the name of the SD card is.

19
00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:16.430
And as you can see, here, it's under
/dev/disk2s1 on /Volumes/SDCard.

20
00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.752
>> Now, please note here that
when it says /dev/disk2s1,

21
00:01:20.752 --> 00:01:27.250
the SD card itself is disc two and the
partition that's mounted currently is S1.

22
00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.830
So essentially what we want to do
is unmount that file system and

23
00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.900
then flash it on to
the entire disc itself.

24
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.160
>> So then what you want to do next
if you want to unmount the disk

25
00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.970
is you want to issue
the command sudo umount and

26
00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.970
then the directory or
the location of your SD card.

27
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.388
So, for us it's gonna be dev/disk2s1,
enter in that.

28
00:01:52.388 --> 00:01:57.435
However, because our SD card
is formatted a certain way,

29
00:01:57.435 --> 00:02:01.500
we have to instead use this other option.

30
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.210
So if the sudo umount worked for

31
00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.490
you, and it did it successfully,
then you're good to go.

32
00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.470
However if it did not, then you want
to issue this following command.

33
00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.810
>> Usually this issue pops
up mostly on Mac computers,

34
00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.610
since diskutil is a Mac utility.

35
00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.315
So if you're actually on a Linux
computer the umount should have worked

36
00:02:22.315 --> 00:02:23.530
perfectly fine.

37
00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.320
>> So then we're now going to
enter in the diskutil unmount.

38
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.170
>> Perfect.

39
00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.780
>> And as you can see it
properly unmounted, right?

40
00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.930
And then, to double check whether or
not your SD card is still available,

41
00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.470
what you want to do then
is enter the command mount.

42
00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.250
And as you can see, it's no longer there.

43
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.000
Right?

44
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.030
>> Perfect.

45
00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.530
>> What's left to do?

46
00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.720
>> I think, are we done?

47
00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.040
>> I think we have one more thing to do.

48
00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.720
Right?
>> Yeah.

49
00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.510
I think we haven't done
the most important part yet,

50
00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.790
which is flashing the image
onto the SD card itself.

51
00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.970
So what you want to do is you want
to issue this following command.

52
00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.780
CD.

53
00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:06.050
So sudo, or actually dd and
then you want to do.

54
00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:07.460
>> Your input image.

55
00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:09.890
So wherever your image is located.

56
00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.500
So in this case,
I believe it's on your desktop.

57
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:12.680
>> Yeah.
So it'll be, oh, whoops.

58
00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.599
It'll be on ~/Desktop and

59
00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:20.346
then it'll be one /Linux\ Rescue\Image.

60
00:03:20.346 --> 00:03:27.424
And from there it's on
the dragonboard410c_sdcard_rescue-40.

61
00:03:27.424 --> 00:03:30.901
[LAUGH] And to continue on,

62
00:03:30.901 --> 00:03:36.380
it is the db410c_sd_rescue.img.

63
00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.620
>> Now we need to specify
our output location.

64
00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:46.034
In this case, as we previously said, it's
going to be the dev/disk2, so dev/disk2s1.

65
00:03:46.034 --> 00:03:47.945
>> Remember s1 is a partition.

66
00:03:47.945 --> 00:03:48.867
>> Yeah.
My bad.

67
00:03:48.867 --> 00:03:50.000
[LAUGH].

68
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.480
And next what you want to do
is you want to set the BS or-

69
00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:56.760
>> I think it's the byte size.

70
00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:57.660
>> Yeah, the byte size.

71
00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.285
>> So generally how big your
packets are gonna be sent over.

72
00:04:02.285 --> 00:04:03.000
>> Mm-hm.

73
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.050
So we're gonna go ahead and give it 2M.

74
00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:12.890
So do note that if your
command doesn't work as such,

75
00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:15.430
try using a lower case m instead.

76
00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.480
And one thing I forgot to mention is that
you have to do this as a super user.

77
00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.850
So we're gonna go ahead and add that.

78
00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.130
>> Generally whenever you're formatting or
writing these image files,

79
00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.085
that's a pretty big operation, or
like a very powerful operation.

80
00:04:31.085 --> 00:04:31.610
>> Yeah.
>> So

81
00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.760
you should only do it as a super user.

82
00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.820
>> So we're gonna go ahead and
issue the command again.

83
00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.341
And what this is now doing is
that it should be flashing

84
00:04:41.341 --> 00:04:44.400
the rescue image onto your SD card.

85
00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.936
>> This is gonna take about I'm gonna
say 20 minutes, so we're go ahead and

86
00:04:48.936 --> 00:04:50.240
stop the video here.

87
00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.560
You guys go ahead and do this.

88
00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.740
And when your rescue image is done,
go ahead and join us in the next section.

89
00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.545
We'll go over on how to actually
recover your dragonboard.
