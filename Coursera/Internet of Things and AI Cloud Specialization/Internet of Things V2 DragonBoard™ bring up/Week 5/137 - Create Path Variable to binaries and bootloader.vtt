00:00:05.164 --> 00:00:08.977
For this part of the lesson, we want to
pretty much walk you through the steps

2
00:00:08.977 --> 00:00:11.240
that you'll need to
create a path variable,

3
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.515
which you've already done before.

4
00:00:13.515 --> 00:00:17.240
And also modifying the script that
comes in the bootloader file that you

5
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.849
downloaded.

6
00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:21.715
So yeah, here once again is gonna
kind of walk you through the steps.

7
00:00:21.715 --> 00:00:26.005
You're gonna need the Terminal or
the MS-DOS command prompt for Windows.

8
00:00:26.005 --> 00:00:26.555
>> Yeah.

9
00:00:26.555 --> 00:00:30.840
>> So like Robert said, open up the
MS-DOS, or the command prompt for Windows.

10
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.670
And then go into your own C drive.

11
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:33.880
So once you're on the command prompt,

12
00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.250
what we wanna do is, we wanna create a
path variable to our fastboot executable.

13
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.927
So that we don't have to keep traversing
through each file to get to the fastboot,

14
00:00:41.927 --> 00:00:43.690
we can just go straight to it.

15
00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:44.290
So here we go.

16
00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:46.550
So to do that, we're gonna type in set.

17
00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.400
So that's gonna set the path variable,
and then we're gonna type in the name of

18
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.500
the path variable, so
we're gonna call it fastboot.

19
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.210
All in lower case here.

20
00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.800
And then a very important
clarification here is that

21
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.810
the difference between a Mac system and
a Window system is that in a Mac system,

22
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.730
you use a forward slash for
a path destination.

23
00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.750
On a Windows, you wanna use the backslash.

24
00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.688
So we're gonna start off here with the C,
and then we're gonna go the Program Files,

25
00:01:09.688 --> 00:01:12.000
and then we're gonna go
into the Android folder.

26
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.190
It should be near sdk and
go to platform tools.

27
00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:23.050
Lastly, you're gonna see the fastboot.exe
there, you're gonna click on that.

28
00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.160
And now we have the path
variable called fastboot.

29
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.704
So now we can start just calling on
fastboot to do whatever we need.

30
00:01:29.704 --> 00:01:34.210
And the next thing we're gonna do is
go into the file that you downloaded,

31
00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.920
all the boot image file and all the other
files that we told you to download there.

32
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.160
So we're gonna go into that file.

33
00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.850
And once you go into that file, you gonna
wanna look for a file that says flashall.

34
00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.270
And this file is, so
you see all these files here and what

35
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.000
you would normally have to do is fastboot
flash each one you just file separately.

36
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.200
But this file called flashall will allow
us to flash everything at the same time,

37
00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.438
it's a script that will run for
you and do everything for you.

38
00:01:58.438 --> 00:01:59.770
So we're gonna click on that.

39
00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.790
And as I go in to our unique and
easier favorite text editor there.

40
00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.720
And then you're gonna see a file
with a bunch of commands there.

41
00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.130
And so what we have to do is,
like we told you earlier,

42
00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.010
we created a pathway called fastboot.

43
00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.350
And the way to access that fastboot
variable is to put a percentage sign

44
00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.190
around that fastboot variable there.

45
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.042
So that's what I'm gonna do here,
just go down the line and

46
00:02:23.042 --> 00:02:24.946
put a percentage sign around each one.

47
00:02:24.946 --> 00:02:28.084
>> Yeah, so
while [INAUDIBLE] goes through that,

48
00:02:28.084 --> 00:02:33.400
kinda talk a little bit more about the
fastboot path variable that he created.

49
00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.927
So if you notice when he was creating
that, he made it a fastboot.exe.

50
00:02:37.927 --> 00:02:45.351
So he went into the file and then actually
created a path to the executable fastboot.

51
00:02:45.351 --> 00:02:49.310
Which means, when he's calling on that
path right there by putting the two

52
00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.230
modulus signs on each side,

53
00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:57.560
he's actually executing the fastboot
with the command flash.

54
00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.700
So he's kind of pushing the path all
the way to the fastboot executable, and

55
00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.370
then one of the commands that
the fastboot has is flash.

56
00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.700
So it's gonna run that whole script in,
and just perform that task many times.

57
00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:09.270
>> Yep, and so

58
00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.650
if you see on my screen here again
we have the file all modified and

59
00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.840
you're gonna see percentage signs around
every single word that says fastboot.

60
00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:18.730
And so-
>> And

61
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.388
one other thing that we wanted to do,
we wanted to also bring in the-

62
00:03:23.388 --> 00:03:24.032
>> Right, right.

63
00:03:24.032 --> 00:03:26.467
>> [CROSSTALK]
>> That's something we want to do too.

64
00:03:26.467 --> 00:03:30.179
So, this, all the files you see right now,
are the files that are for

65
00:03:30.179 --> 00:03:34.597
the boot loader, but if you remember,
we also downloaded a bunch of other files,

66
00:03:34.597 --> 00:03:37.310
called user data, cache,
recovery, all that.

67
00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:38.190
>> The six files.

68
00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.740
>> Yeah.

69
00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:40.630
So what we're going to do, is just,

70
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.000
we don't want to flash all that separately
either, so we're just going to do that.

71
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.750
And then here at the end of the file
you wanna copy the third chunk,

72
00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.020
copy, paste it right below it again.

73
00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:56.150
And then instead of erase you just
wanna change all of that to flash.

74
00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.110
>> So now you can kinda see what's
happening throughout this script,

75
00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:03.050
is first it's flashing on the boot loader.

76
00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:07.410
Then it's erasing all of the files that
we downloaded, those other six files,

77
00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:08.330
all of the-
>> Previous ones, yeah.

78
00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:09.750
>> Previous operating system.

79
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.820
And then we're going to
re flash the new ones.

80
00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:13.550
>> Yeah.
>> So.

81
00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:14.450
>> The latest ones here.

82
00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:14.950
Here.
>> Yeah.

83
00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.100
>> So, now we have a fully functional
executable file here, ready to go.

84
00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.160
And all we have to do now is
just run the script file, and

85
00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.640
we'll have our operating system.

86
00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.610
On the next video,
we'll show you exactly how to do that.
