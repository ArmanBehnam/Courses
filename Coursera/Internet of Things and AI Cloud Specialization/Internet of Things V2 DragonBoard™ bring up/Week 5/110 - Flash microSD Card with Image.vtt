00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.240
Welcome back.

2
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:04.760
Here we're gonna go ahead and

3
00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.970
install the image you just downloaded
off the website onto the SD card.

4
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:09.540
>> Mm-hm.
>> So

5
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.650
first make sure you have your SD card and
then we'll go ahead on the computer.

6
00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:15.980
With the terminal open,

7
00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.090
you want to first type in the command
mount to see what partitions you currently

8
00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.950
have on your computer because you don't
want to accidentally overwrite something.

9
00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.302
Next you want to plug in
the SD card into the computer,

10
00:00:29.302 --> 00:00:35.877
type mount again.

11
00:00:35.877 --> 00:00:41.804
And here we see that the SD
card is under dev/disk2s1.

12
00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.710
Next thing you wanna do is go ahead and
unmount it.

13
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.580
So the command for that is sudo
umount along with the destination.

14
00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:59.002
In this case, it's /dev/disk2s1.

15
00:00:59.002 --> 00:01:01.110
Go ahead and type in your password.

16
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:09.100
So here we see that you might get
this error and to fix this error,

17
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.010
all you do is just use
the command they give you.

18
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.221
So we're gonna go ahead and

19
00:01:14.221 --> 00:01:20.230
type in sudo diskutil
unmount /dev/disk2s1.

20
00:01:23.266 --> 00:01:28.060
Here we see that it was unmounted as
the image disappeared off the desktop.

21
00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.530
To check this you could
also type mount again.

22
00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.440
And you see it's no longer there.

23
00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.390
>> Now for us to be able to flash the SD,
the micro SD card with the image,

24
00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:45.342
we want to issue the command sudo dd,
and then in the I-F or

25
00:01:45.342 --> 00:01:50.520
if option we want it to, we want to set
that equal to the path of the image, so

26
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.970
if you recall from the previous section,
it'll be $LinaroImage.

27
00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.580
Next we want to specify
the destination with the O-F option.

28
00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.090
So we're gonna say of=
to the path of the card.

29
00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.840
And so recall that it's /dev/disk2 and

30
00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.900
we're omitting the S1 because the S1
is referring to a specific partition

31
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.690
in the disk and
we want to write on the whole disk itself.

32
00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.489
And lastly we want to
pass in the bs option and

33
00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:28.457
We're going to say bs=2M and
once we press enter we,

34
00:02:28.457 --> 00:02:36.929
if you get a, an error such as this try
issuing the command with a lower case m.

35
00:02:36.929 --> 00:02:42.510
And once you enter, once you press enter
your Ubuntu image will now be flashed or

36
00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.680
it will begin flashing the Ubuntu
image onto the micro SD card.

37
00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.100
Now depending on the speed
of your computer and

38
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.920
perhaps the speed of your SD card,
this may take a few minutes.

39
00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.590
>> Okay, here we are with the finished

40
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.140
installation of the image
onto the SD card.

41
00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.500
So here we're gonna go ahead and
move this pop-up

42
00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.710
out of the way because what you wanna do
is type in sync into the command line.

43
00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:20.150
>> And what sync will do is it will
essentially make sure that all

44
00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:26.800
the flashing was properly done and
the flush, the cache was flushed.

45
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.544
>> And here now you can just go ahead and
eject the SD card.

46
00:03:32.348 --> 00:03:34.315
>> Now once that's ejected,

47
00:03:34.315 --> 00:03:39.446
we've successfully flashed the Linaro
image onto our micro SD card and

48
00:03:39.446 --> 00:03:44.490
in the next section, Randy and
I will show you how to go about doing so,

49
00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:50.164
how to use the SD card to flash the Linaro
image onto your dragon board 410C.
