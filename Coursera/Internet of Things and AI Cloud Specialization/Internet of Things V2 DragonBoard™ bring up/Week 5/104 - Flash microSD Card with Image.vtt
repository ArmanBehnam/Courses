00:00:02.521 --> 00:00:04.425
All right, so
now we're going to go ahead and

2
00:00:04.425 --> 00:00:06.190
install the image onto the microSD card.

3
00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:08.930
First thing you want to do is
make sure you have your SD card.

4
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:11.670
And now we're gonna go into the screen.

5
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.846
>> So first of all, you wanna do to check
what your current existing partitions

6
00:00:17.846 --> 00:00:19.771
are is to enter the command mount.

7
00:00:22.391 --> 00:00:25.991
>> Now, here what you wanna do is
go ahead and put in your SD card.

8
00:00:28.071 --> 00:00:32.474
And go ahead and type mount again so you
can know which partition is the SD card so

9
00:00:32.474 --> 00:00:35.690
you don't accidentally
overwrite your own hard drive.

10
00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.394
In our case it's gonna be /dev/disk2s1.

11
00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:47.900
>> So
after you find out what the location is,

12
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.490
you want to enter the command sudo umount,
and

13
00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.870
then follow it up with the directory or

14
00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.660
the path to the SD card,
and pressing Enter.

15
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.910
Now for some instances, you might get
an error such as this, and if you do

16
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.650
receive this error, you want to go ahead
and follow the command that they suggest.

17
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.440
So, we're gonna do sudo diskutil unmount,
and

18
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.770
then the following directory for
for disk2s1.

19
00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:25.060
Now upon entering that command we can
check to see whether or not its been

20
00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:31.280
unmounted by typing the command mount and
as you can see its back to normal.

21
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.430
Additionally if you saw on
Randy's screen the SD card image

22
00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.680
on his desktop disappeared which is also
an indication that it's been unmounted.

23
00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.810
So now what we're gonna do is
we wanna flash the microSD

24
00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.680
card with the android image.

25
00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.230
So the command for
that would be sudo, dd and

26
00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:56.000
then you want to specify the if
option to be to equal to

27
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.850
the android image path.

28
00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.310
So, we called it AndroidImage.

29
00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:12.770
And then you want to flash it onto the of
which is going to equal to /dev/disk 2.

30
00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:20.965
And lastly you want to specify the BS
option so we're gonna say bs is=2M.

31
00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.600
And if you get an error such as this,

32
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.680
just change the M from
an upper case to a lower case.

33
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:40.470
So now the screen or rather, the laptop is
now flashing the image onto the SD card.

34
00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.311
And this may take a while, so sit back and

35
00:02:43.311 --> 00:02:47.081
hold on tight while this
kind of does it's own thing.

36
00:02:49.761 --> 00:02:56.480
So after the Android image was flashed,
a pop up like this should come up.

37
00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.820
Now you don't want to immediately
click on any of the options yet,

38
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.250
because there's another command
that we're gonna want to do.

39
00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:10.020
So we're gonna want to type the command
sync, and once that command's done,

40
00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:15.470
we can then eject the SD card.

41
00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.860
Here, Andy's gonna take the SD card out.

42
00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.690
And we're good, so stay tuned.

43
00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.270
In the next section we'll show you
how to flip the proper switches on in

44
00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:32.050
the back of the DragonBoard,
as well as how to install the new Android

45
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.370
operating system into the DragonBoard.
