Hey everyone.

2
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.200
In this session we're going to be going
over some different way to, go ahead and

3
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.620
diagnose what type of problem
your dragon board has.

4
00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:15.590
Now, make sure to take sure extra
precaution when you're doing this because

5
00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:20.570
the dragon board can, is a bit of
a delicate piece of hardware in the sense

6
00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.060
that if you accidentally touch something,
or if you plug in stuff at the wrong ports

7
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.010
or Just some awful wrong combination,
it can actually end up frying the board.

8
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.743
So just make sure when you're
trying to diagnose it,

9
00:00:31.743 --> 00:00:33.331
you handle it with extra care.

10
00:00:33.331 --> 00:00:33.871
>> Yeah.

11
00:00:33.871 --> 00:00:38.660
And with that in mind, when you think
the kinda different types of bricking

12
00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.220
the board can have, if your board has
a software, or is soft bricked and

13
00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.700
that means that when you turn it on,
the lights will be flashing.

14
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.810
However, there might
be some corruption and

15
00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:55.440
operating system that will prevent
a screen from being showed on HDMI.

16
00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.120
>> Now for hardware break,
usually if you plug it in,

17
00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.700
there might be no lights turning on.

18
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.850
You might take a volt meter trying like
see it from voltages see it might not

19
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:06.760
be working.

20
00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.710
That's usually indicative that there's
something on the board that's fried,

21
00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.050
whether it's a single component, or
a fuse or just something on the board.

22
00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.340
It's just fried you can't use it.

23
00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.740
>> And do note that these are just
some potential ways that we

24
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.470
I guess are classifying bricked boards.

25
00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.199
And so definitely we suggest
you to re-search and,

26
00:01:29.199 --> 00:01:33.700
a kinda limit the possibilities of what
types of errors, error problems that your

27
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:39.300
Brick Board may have, go ahead and check
out 96 bolts are old, check out the forums

28
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.150
if you participate, some people might
have faced some of the problems and

29
00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.950
so they may be able to better
provide you at a solution.

30
00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.940
>> And also go ahead and take Google on.

31
00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.775
Sometimes the problems that
are common amongst other

32
00:01:53.775 --> 00:01:56.057
controllers might be the case
of the Dragon Board as well.

33
00:01:56.057 --> 00:02:00.820
So go ahead and just make sure you try
both 96boards.org and Google as well.
