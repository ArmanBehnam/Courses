Greetings Windows users.

2
00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:07.253
Welcome to lesson 3b.

3
00:00:07.253 --> 00:00:09.963
Here we're going to show
you how to flash Ubuntu

4
00:00:09.963 --> 00:00:12.480
on to your DragonBoard with the SD card.

5
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.150
>> All right.
So,

6
00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.330
the first thing we're going to
do is downlaod the Ubuntu image.

7
00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.740
>> Afterward we're gonna
download the Win32diskimager,

8
00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:27.700
which is just a program to help us
install the image file onto the SD card.

9
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.070
>> Once we have everything
downloaded that we need,

10
00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.600
we're going to flash the image onto the
MicroSD card, using the win32diskimager.

11
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.220
>> Finally,
with that flashed image on the SD card,

12
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.232
we're going to go ahead and put it in
the DragonBoard, and install the OS.

13
00:00:41.232 --> 00:00:42.070
>> All right.

14
00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.820
So, with this in mind,
let's get started, and

15
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.610
we'll start downloading the Ubuntu image.
