Hello everyone and welcome to lesson 3c.

2
00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:08.050
In this lesson, we're going to pretty much

3
00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.420
get you the Android operating
system onto your DragonBoard 410c.

4
00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.340
In order to do this,
we're going to need to take a few steps.

5
00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.670
And the first step of course is
downloading all of the necessary

6
00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:19.470
files you'll need.

7
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.190
This includes the binaries and
the boot loader.

8
00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.180
>> And then the next think we need
to do is create a path variable.

9
00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.690
A path variable is just a tool to
access the fast boot executable.

10
00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:31.980
So we're going to create a path
variable to the path boot executable.

11
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.940
Then we're gonna modify a script file.

12
00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.630
The script file is something that will
allow us to flash everything on at

13
00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.720
the same time, all the different files,
instead of doing it one by one.

14
00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.590
Makes your like a lot easier.

15
00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.800
And then the last thing we're gonna do
is actually start flashing each other

16
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.380
files onto the Dragon Board.

17
00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:49.900
>> Yeah.
So stay tuned and

18
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.630
we got a few videos in this lesson.

19
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.860
It'll be a lot of fun, and we'll get
you the Android operating system up and

20
00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:55.470
running in no time.
