00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:06.060
Let's take a look back and let's
summarize what we learned in lesson two.

2
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.290
So first, we showed you where to
download the recovery or rescue image.

3
00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:15.686
So that required us to go to 96boards.org,
and click on the user guides, and

4
00:00:15.686 --> 00:00:21.230
download the appropriate zip file for
either Android or the Linaro.

5
00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.020
Then, we went ahead and mounted or
rather not mounting but

6
00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.530
rather plug in our SD card using
a mount/ umount commands to go ahead and

7
00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:36.400
unmount the file system and then flashing
it onto the SD card via Linux and Mac.

8
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.510
If you're on a Windows computer, you're
gonna go ahead and use Win32diskimager

9
00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.690
software, which you can learn
more about in module four.

10
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.935
>> And lastly, we showed you
what steps you need to take and

11
00:00:48.935 --> 00:00:53.562
kind of what modifications you need to
perform for your DragonBoard in order for

12
00:00:53.562 --> 00:00:56.620
you to be able to reflash
the OS if you have fast boot.

13
00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.035
>> Remember, just to recall that,

14
00:00:59.035 --> 00:01:04.920
the SD card only acts as a way to connect
your EMMC flash if it can't do so already.

15
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.713
So, if you want to flash or
reflash your Alpine system,

16
00:01:08.713 --> 00:01:10.740
you gotta do it via fast boot.
