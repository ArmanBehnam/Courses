00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.120
Welcome to part one or

2
00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.940
section one of lesson 2D, as promised
we are going to walk you through

3
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.330
the process of downloading the bootloader
and binaries that you're going to need

4
00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.560
in order to use fast boot to flash this
Ubuntu operating system onto your board.

5
00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.001
So Randy, lets see what we got here,
want to kind of show you this.

6
00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:22.490
>> All right, let's get started.

7
00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.200
So go ahead and head over to 96boards.org,

8
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.957
this is where we will get all
the downloads for the dragon board.

9
00:00:28.957 --> 00:00:35.432
So the first thing we'll wanna do is
click on this blue dragon board 410C.

10
00:00:35.432 --> 00:00:40.023
Then after you get to this page you
wanna look for this downloads tab so

11
00:00:40.023 --> 00:00:41.936
we can get to our downloads.

12
00:00:41.936 --> 00:00:44.482
>> You can imagine it's going
to be a download, right?

13
00:00:44.482 --> 00:00:47.080
[LAUGH]
>> Go ahead and scroll down a little bit,

14
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.540
and we're going to look for

15
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.960
this line right here to go
to the wiki links they have.

16
00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.410
This wiki link contains all
the downloads for the fast-boot.

17
00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.520
>> Yeah, on this page also,
it's worth it to take a few minutes,

18
00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.030
if not more, to kind of search around.

19
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.020
There's lots of very good resources
on this page for you to use.

20
00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.240
Supplemental materials.

21
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.600
>> If something doesn't make sense
in like the video or the documents,

22
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.410
you guys can just check out this here.

23
00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:16.720
Should have all the instructions you need.

24
00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.880
So go ahead and scroll down, and
we'll click on the flash boot loader

25
00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.140
under the board right here,
before the release.

26
00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.050
So after you get here you wanna go to this
line right here and then click on this.

27
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:38.440
This is the boot loader that we'll need
to start up the fast boot install.

28
00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.550
>> Yeah there's several files you're
actually gonna download here,

29
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:45.360
one of them is the boot loader and then
as you can see, so he's downloading it.

30
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.480
A little bit further down there's a few
other files, one of which is going

31
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:57.100
to be the command line version of a Ubuntu
which Randy's gonna highlight there.

32
00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.239
That's the command line version.

33
00:02:01.239 --> 00:02:05.047
>> We need the boot
image right here first.

34
00:02:05.047 --> 00:02:07.814
And then, we're not going to
use the command line version,

35
00:02:07.814 --> 00:02:10.360
instead we're going to use
the graphical version.

36
00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.720
So, we'll go ahead and
head down to this note right here.

37
00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.258
We'll click on this download.

38
00:02:18.258 --> 00:02:19.207
All right, cool.

39
00:02:19.207 --> 00:02:20.550
>> Awesome.

40
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.830
Yeah so while that downloads maybe
go make yourself a cup of tea.

41
00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:25.770
>> Yeah, that sounds good.

42
00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:26.970
A sandwich.

43
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:27.560
>> Yeah, sandwich.

44
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.230
We'll be back to show you how to
modify your boot loader and binaries.

45
00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.740
I'm sorry, modify your boot loader and
your script in just a little bit.
