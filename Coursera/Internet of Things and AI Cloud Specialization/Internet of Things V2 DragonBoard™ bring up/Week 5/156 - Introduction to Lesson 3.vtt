00:00:02.751 --> 00:00:04.110
Welcome back.

2
00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.900
In this lesson we're going
to go over brick prevention.

3
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.110
>> Yeah, in this lesson we will talk
to you about different ways you could

4
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.720
end up shorting your board.

5
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.748
Possibly through the DC connector or

6
00:00:13.748 --> 00:00:17.580
through the various GPIO interfaces
that are available to you.

7
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.490
We're also going to touch
on different ways you could

8
00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:28.330
soft brick it by deleting partition tables
from within the operating system or

9
00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.540
not following different
flashing procedures correctly.

10
00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:32.891
>> Even disconnecting your board,

11
00:00:32.891 --> 00:00:35.708
will also probably result in
a corruption of your operating system.

12
00:00:35.708 --> 00:00:39.198
So, make sure in the next following
sections that you go ahead and

13
00:00:39.198 --> 00:00:42.761
listen to these warnings and try and
prevent them from happening.

14
00:00:42.761 --> 00:00:46.760
>> We really want to make sure that your
board is safe and that you don't mess it

15
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.320
up because you'll end up with just
a very expensive paper weight.
