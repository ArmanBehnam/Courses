00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.890
All right, this wraps up the Lesson 3D for
installing the Ubuntu operating

2
00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.120
system by fast boot,
flashing it onto your Dragonboard 410C.

3
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.310
I want to kinda go over what
we went over in this lesson.

4
00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:16.310
First, we took you through the website,
taught you where and how to

5
00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:20.599
download all the binaries and the boot
loader for the Ubuntu operating system.

6
00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.260
>> And then once we had everything
we needed to start flashing,

7
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.500
we then carry the path variable.

8
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.950
Path variable is just a tool to help
us access the executable fast boot,

9
00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:31.320
the fast boot executable faster.

10
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.960
And then the second thing we did in that
same video was we showed you how to modify

11
00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.170
the flashall file.

12
00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.150
The flashall file was just a script file
that allows us to flash everything we need

13
00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.980
in just one go instead of having
to flash everything individually.

14
00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.840
And then lastly,
in the next video after that,

15
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.930
we showed you guys how to actually start
flashing everything onto the Dragonboard.

16
00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.730
So we connected the USB
to the Dragonboard,

17
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.970
made sure the switches were
in the right configuration.

18
00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.410
And then we just started executing
the script file, and then

19
00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.280
we flashed the boot image file and then we
flashed the root fs file, and there we go.

20
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.240
If you had everything
flashed onto Dragonboard and

21
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.520
the Linaro operating system
should be on the Dragonboard now.

22
00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.710
So hopefully, you were successfully
able to get the Linaro operating system

23
00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.110
onto your Dragonboard.

24
00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.690
And if not you can look at
our documentations, and

25
00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.160
we'll see you on our future videos.
