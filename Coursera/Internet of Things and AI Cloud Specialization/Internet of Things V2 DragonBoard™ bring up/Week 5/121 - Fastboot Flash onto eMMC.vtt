00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.550
At this point in the game,
you've already downloaded all of your

2
00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.220
files that you need,
the image and the bootloader.

3
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.440
Then you created your path variable to
the Fastboot within the Android SDK, and

4
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.970
you modified your script.

5
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.550
So it's time to actually put
everything on the board, right?

6
00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.710
Or else, what did we do all that for?

7
00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:21.682
So yeah, here we go.

8
00:00:21.682 --> 00:00:23.236
>> So let's start checking the board here.

9
00:00:23.236 --> 00:00:27.100
So the first thing you wanna do is
make sure your board is powered down.

10
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.060
We have ours unplugged.

11
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.153
Go ahead and throw in your HDMI.

12
00:00:31.153 --> 00:00:34.771
We have this USB connection to our
keyboard and mouse right here.

13
00:00:34.771 --> 00:00:38.715
And all right, so the next thing you
wanna do is flip over the board and

14
00:00:38.715 --> 00:00:41.720
look for the dip switches right here.

15
00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.920
You want to make sure it's
in the 0000 configuration,

16
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.870
because you don't want to have an SD
card boot or something like that.

17
00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.470
>> That's the most standard configuration,
you'll be using 0000 in most cases.

18
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.690
That's going to allow us to
boot into Fastboot, so yeah.

19
00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:56.190
>> Great.

20
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.080
>> And now we're where ready
to boot it all up, right?

21
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.202
>> Oh wait, dude, we almost forgot this.

22
00:01:05.202 --> 00:01:06.334
>> [LAUGH] All right, good.

23
00:01:06.334 --> 00:01:09.035
Yeah, so actually you need to-
>> This is the micro-USB.

24
00:01:09.035 --> 00:01:10.740
>> Yeah, you need to send
everything somehow, right.

25
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.382
So actually, we're gonna hook up
the USB port to the board here.

26
00:01:14.382 --> 00:01:19.450
All right, so micro-USB to USB,
plugging that in.

27
00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.200
And now we're all set up, right?

28
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.770
>> Almost.

29
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.160
>> Almost, we need to get into Fastboot.

30
00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.050
>> Right.
>> Okay, so

31
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.570
there was a previous lesson that you've
already seen, on how to do Fastboot.

32
00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.880
But we're gonna remind
you here one more time.

33
00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.490
And how do we do that, Randy?

34
00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.150
>> So, you wanna just look for
this S4 button, or

35
00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.390
the volume down button right here.

36
00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.110
Just hold on to that, and when that's
pressed down, you just power the board up.

37
00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.270
>> We found that a nice sweet
spot is about ten seconds.

38
00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:53.550
So if you hold on to the minus button for
about ten seconds after plugging it in.

39
00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.520
So you can about let it go right now.

40
00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.320
You'll boot into Fastboot.

41
00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.680
If you hold onto it too long, sometimes
what happens is it goes past the Fastboot

42
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.070
and then just boots into the operating
system that you already had on the board.

43
00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.720
So how can we tell if we're in Fastboot or
not?

44
00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.780
>> All right,
let's go into the computer then.

45
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:10.710
>> All right, let's check it out.

46
00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:16.030
>> So in the previous section,
we already set up the path variable.

47
00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.070
So we'll just do $fastboot,
and type the word, devices.

48
00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.840
As you can see here,
it came up with a device.

49
00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.030
>> Yeah, you can see the little
code tied to the board there.

50
00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.301
That shows that the device is,
in fact, recognized by the Fastboot.

51
00:02:30.301 --> 00:02:32.425
And if this doesn't work for you,

52
00:02:32.425 --> 00:02:36.170
maybe you took some time between
the last video and this one.

53
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.430
It's possible if you
closed down your terminal,

54
00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.370
your path variable might have been erased.

55
00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.460
So all you'll have to do
is just kinda go back and

56
00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.392
recreate that path variable to Fastboot.

57
00:02:44.392 --> 00:02:46.400
Yeah, and you'll be fine.

58
00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.460
All right, so we wanna push
everything on there now, right?

59
00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.295
>> Right, so then we're in the folder
with all of the image files,

60
00:02:51.295 --> 00:02:53.490
along with the flash file script.

61
00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.092
>> So
all we need to do now is type ./flashall.

62
00:02:57.092 --> 00:02:58.926
>> And what's gonna happen?

63
00:02:58.926 --> 00:03:00.251
All right, let's see.

64
00:03:00.251 --> 00:03:00.751
>> Nice.

65
00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.970
>> So right now,

66
00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.430
what's happening is it is actually
flashing everything over onto your board.

67
00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.720
This may take about five minutes usually.

68
00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:10.250
>> Five minutes, yeah.

69
00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.140
>> Yeah, I think it's about one-third
of the time that it takes to flash

70
00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.700
an SD card.

71
00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.921
Which is why this is
usually a faster process.

72
00:03:15.921 --> 00:03:17.601
>> Hence, the name Fastboot.

73
00:03:17.601 --> 00:03:22.040
>> [LAUGH] But as you can see,
it is a little more difficult.

74
00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.980
So we're gonna kind of
let this all go through.

75
00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.970
Hopefully, you were able
to follow along with us.

76
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.060
And we look forward to seeing
you in later sections,

77
00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.290
to have some fun with
this operating system.
