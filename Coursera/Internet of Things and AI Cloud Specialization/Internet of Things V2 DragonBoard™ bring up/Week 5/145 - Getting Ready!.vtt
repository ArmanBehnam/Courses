00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:05.660
Module 5,
how to recover your bricked board.

2
00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.422
What do I mean by recovering
a bricked board is, you know,

3
00:00:09.422 --> 00:00:14.390
if you do something stupid with the board,
I mean, for example, have you ever filled

4
00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:18.300
windshield wiper fluid into where
you're supposed to pour in oil?

5
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.350
I've done that.

6
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.580
So you might do something with your board,
in terms of,

7
00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.810
you to load up some software that you're
not supposed to or hardware wise,

8
00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.120
something went wrong or maybe you
dropped the bowl down your toilet.

9
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.730
So, common causes.

10
00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.470
We're gonna cover in this
module how to recover from

11
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.390
most of the issues you may come across.
