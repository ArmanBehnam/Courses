00:00:04.056 --> 00:00:11.920
So hopefully you've finished flashing
the Android image onto the SD card.

2
00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.763
And so, first what you wanna do is you
wanna make sure that your DragonBoard is

3
00:00:16.763 --> 00:00:18.350
powered down.

4
00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:19.740
And once you have that in mind,

5
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.660
you want to get your microSD card and
insert it here.

6
00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.655
So, once that's inserted,
we're gonna go ahead and turn it on.

7
00:00:28.655 --> 00:00:29.260
>> Whoa, hang on, hang on.

8
00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:30.180
>> Oh.

9
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.640
>> We forgot to change the boot switches.

10
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.370
>> Oh, right, right.

11
00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.704
So, that's an important aspect
that I completely forgot and so

12
00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:40.710
we're gonna go ahead and switch that.

13
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:47.170
So you want to get something kind of small
that will allow you to flip the switches.

14
00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.240
So as you can see here,
those are the switches.

15
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.100
>> And we want to put it into
a zero one one configuration.

16
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:08.499
>> So now that we have that,
we can now safely turn on the DragonBoard.

17
00:01:08.499 --> 00:01:09.620
The light indicates it's booting.

18
00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:17.680
And while it's booting up, you can see
that the lights are on, so that's good.

19
00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.880
And if you look at the screen on
the DragonBoard, you'll see that

20
00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:29.140
this new screen pops up,
as opposed to the regular screen, and so

21
00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.720
you want to go ahead and click this,
install operating system.

22
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:34.385
Click on that.

23
00:01:34.385 --> 00:01:40.100
Now, do note that since we
are installing a new operating system,

24
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.760
this will clear the current
operating system with its files.

25
00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.250
And so, if you want to do just that,
then click yes.

26
00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.605
This may take a few minutes or
seconds, depending on how fast

27
00:01:53.605 --> 00:01:58.964
the DragonBoard can read and
write with the SD card, right?

28
00:01:58.964 --> 00:02:00.658
>> Mm-hm.

29
00:02:00.658 --> 00:02:03.470
>> So after it flashes,

30
00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:09.110
you should receive this message that
the operating system is installed and

31
00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.600
what you want to do is, as it says here,
we want to remove the SD card.

32
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.830
And then press OK.

33
00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.880
So we're going to go ahead and
take the SD card out, and

34
00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.440
it's good, and we're then going
to click OK on the screen.

35
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.500
What should happen now is
the DragonBoard will now reboot, and

36
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.260
because it freshly installed
the Android operating system,

37
00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.550
it might take a while for
it to reach the front page.

38
00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.690
With that in mind, you've successfully, or
we've successfully, and hopefully you too

39
00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:48.910
as well, have changed the operating system
of your DragonBoard to the Android OS.
