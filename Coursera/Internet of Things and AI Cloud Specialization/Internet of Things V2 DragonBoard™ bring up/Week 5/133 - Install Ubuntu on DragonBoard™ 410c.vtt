00:00:03.443 --> 00:00:07.238
Everyone, we're gonna go
ahead in this section and

2
00:00:07.238 --> 00:00:14.080
use that SD card with the Ubuntu images
to install the OS onto the dragon board.

3
00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.991
>> All right, so
as you can see on my computer here,

4
00:00:16.991 --> 00:00:21.760
once the write is successful, you're
gonna get a little pop-up screen here.

5
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.110
You gonna click OK, and
it's gonna say Done.

6
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.850
And next thing we wanna do is,
we wanna go into our file explorer and

7
00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.650
we wanna make sure that
the SD card is safe to eject.

8
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.370
So, I click on eject here and

9
00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.130
it's gonna say safe to remove the, Micro
SD card so we are going to take it out.

10
00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.200
Next, we are going to go
into our Dragon Board here.

11
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.755
>> The first thing is you want to make
sure your Dragon Board is powered down, so

12
00:00:46.755 --> 00:00:49.472
make sure that the cable
has been unplugged.

13
00:00:49.472 --> 00:00:53.959
>> The next thing we want to do
here is make sure that the boot

14
00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:56.170
switches are in 0110.

15
00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.310
Then you can find this by flipping over
your Dragon board, and looking for

16
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.670
this little box right here
with the boot switches.

17
00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.630
So with the 10, 110 configuration we're
gonna flip these two center ones.

18
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:17.510
>> And now the Dragon board is ready
to be booted up with the Ubuntu image.

19
00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:22.620
So we're gonna take our SD card and
put it into our Dragon Board.

20
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.640
And we're gonna power up the Dragon Board.

21
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.999
Hopefully, the Dragon Board will pop
up into the installation page here.

22
00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.780
You excited to see what
to your dragon board?

23
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.320
>> I am Randy and here it is.

24
00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.330
We're going to click
on install right here.

25
00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.560
And we get a warning and we click yes.

26
00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.290
And it's going to start
flashing that Ubuntu image.

27
00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.340
You can see that the The o,

28
00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.390
operating system has been
flashed onto the DragonBoard.

29
00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:56.970
So we're gonna click OK here,

30
00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.390
and as soon as we click OK here
the board is gonna start booting up.

31
00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.010
And we're gonna remove the SD card from
the DragonBoard once it's turned off.

32
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.450
So we're gonna remove the SD card now.

33
00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.670
And the board is gonna start putting
up right into the operating system.

34
00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.540
>> With that said and done,

35
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.960
hopefully now you have your
Lenaros OS on the DragonBoard.

36
00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.060
And, there's many things
you can do with it.

37
00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.950
In future lessons and
courses we're gonna go ahead and

38
00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.450
show you what you can do with systems
such as LED blocks, what not.

39
00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:35.820
>> Yeah, see you there.

40
00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:36.320
Thank you.
