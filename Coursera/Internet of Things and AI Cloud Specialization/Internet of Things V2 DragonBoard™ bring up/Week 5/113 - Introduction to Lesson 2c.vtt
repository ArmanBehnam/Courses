00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:03.020
Hey, everyone.

2
00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:04.560
Hope everyone's doing well.

3
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.348
And in the next set of videos,
we're gonna show you how to flash

4
00:00:08.348 --> 00:00:13.980
Android using fastboot through a Linux
system, through a Mac actually, yeah.

5
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.390
And so the first thing we're gonna do
is go to the 96boards.org website and

6
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.786
download all the different
binary files that we need to,

7
00:00:21.786 --> 00:00:24.410
that are going to be flashed
onto the DragonBoard.

8
00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.477
>> Yeah, once we've downloaded everything,
we're going to take you into one of

9
00:00:27.477 --> 00:00:30.120
the boot scripts that actually,
that they provide for us.

10
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.500
We're going to modify it a little bit.

11
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.070
We're going to create a path variable to

12
00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.000
the fastboot that we have on
our system through the SDK.

13
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.240
All of this stuff you've
kind of learned before.

14
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.580
We're just gonna kinda
do a little bit extra.

15
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:46.490
And then we're going to boot
the board up into fastboot and

16
00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:48.240
flash everything over onto it,

17
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.480
so by the end of this lesson you should
be running your Android operating system.

18
00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.830
>> And see you in the next video with
downloading all the Android binaries.
