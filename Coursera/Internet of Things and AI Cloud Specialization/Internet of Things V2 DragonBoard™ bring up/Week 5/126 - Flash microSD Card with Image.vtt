00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:03.670
>> Welcome back everyone.

2
00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:06.950
In this section we're gonna show you how
to flash the SD card with the images.

3
00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:13.290
So on Usigi's laptop we already extracted
the ZIP file we downloaded in the first

4
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.970
section and we've already installed
the Win32 Disk Imager in a second section.

5
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.890
>> So, the first thing we're gonna do
is Click on the Win32 Disk Imager icon.

6
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.530
And it'll ask if you wanna run this app.

7
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.680
We need to click yes, and
a little GUI will pop up.

8
00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.550
Next thing we wanna do is, you're
gonna see a small button right here.

9
00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.670
And you're gonna click on that and
you're gonna find our image file.

10
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.362
Once we go into our image file.

11
00:00:40.362 --> 00:00:43.748
We wanna click on the dot image file,
open.

12
00:00:43.748 --> 00:00:50.550
Next we wanna click on the device
drive E which is the SD card.

13
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.970
So when you plug in your
SD card into your computer,

14
00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.790
It's gonna have a letter
associated with it.

15
00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.780
You can now want to click on that letter.

16
00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.000
Finally we're gonna want to write,
we're just gonna click right on it.

17
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.740
And it'll ask is if we're sure we wanna
write the image onto the SD card.

18
00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:07.290
And we're gonna write it, and

19
00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.500
it's gonna start flashing that
Android Operating System onto the SD card.

20
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.690
And while this is writing onto the SD
card, we'll see you in the next section

21
00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.890
on how to actually put the SD
card onto the DragonBoard.
