00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:07.020
in this section we're going to go over
on how not to disconnect a DC jack

2
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.860
while you are operating system or
your port is still on.

3
00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.109
So make sure that when you want
to power down the board or

4
00:00:14.109 --> 00:00:18.461
whatever that you don't just simply unplug
it because, as Robert mentioned earlier.

5
00:00:18.461 --> 00:00:19.046
Doing so

6
00:00:19.046 --> 00:00:24.480
can maybe cause an important operation
that's going on to just be stopped and

7
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.840
basically, in the middle of it's
operation of something very important.

8
00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:32.320
>> Yeah.
So essentially,

9
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.750
you have things going on on the board.

10
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.910
It's constantly writing on
to the IC chips on board.

11
00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.200
And obviously it requires power for
these operations to happen.

12
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.910
If you just abruptly
stop that from happening.

13
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.453
Something might have been written in
a place that need to be completed and

14
00:00:49.453 --> 00:00:51.471
you just end up corrupted file.

15
00:00:51.471 --> 00:00:54.124
Your operating system will
no longer boot up, and

16
00:00:54.124 --> 00:00:59.500
next thing you know you have a soft brick
board which of course can be fixed, right?

17
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.170
>> Yeah, using the methods that we
did previously in section 2, or

18
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.640
lesson 2 rather.

19
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.530
That usually helps solve those issues.

20
00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.110
Now if it's just the operating system
that's having issues or whatever,

21
00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.100
usually just reflashing it will do so.

22
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.711
Later on we'll go over when to really use
a rescue image and where it really shines.
