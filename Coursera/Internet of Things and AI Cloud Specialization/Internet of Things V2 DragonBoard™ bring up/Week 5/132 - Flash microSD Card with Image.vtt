00:00:02.577 --> 00:00:04.436
Hey everyone, welcome back.

2
00:00:04.436 --> 00:00:10.010
And now we're gonna show you exactly
how to install the image file,

3
00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.430
the operating system,
onto the SD card here.

4
00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:17.650
And so on my screen you can see that
we've already extracted the folder.

5
00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.280
And we've already installed
the Win32DiskImager onto our computer.

6
00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.290
>> Oh, so now we're gonna go ahead and
just open the Win32DiskImager.

7
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.720
>> Click here and we're gonna run the app.

8
00:00:29.455 --> 00:00:31.550
>> The next thing we do is go ahead and

9
00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.360
click on the button right here
to search for your image file.

10
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.210
Our image file is on
the desktop in this folder.

11
00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.990
Select the image file that you want.

12
00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.940
>> The Ubuntu image here.

13
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.460
And next we also wanna click
on the right device driver.

14
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.930
So as soon as you plug in your
sd card into your computer,

15
00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.800
there's gonna be a letter
associated with the driver.

16
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.542
And for us it's the letter E,

17
00:00:54.542 --> 00:00:58.599
so we're gonna click on the letter E and
we're gonna click on Write.

18
00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.460
And we gonna say Yes,
we wanna write onto the device.

19
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.046
>> And with that,
we're gonna go ahead and let this run and

20
00:01:07.046 --> 00:01:08.860
we'll go see you in the next section.
