Hey guys, module four is gonna be how
to install the operating system of your

2
00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:07.960
choice into the board.

3
00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.030
As we mentioned, there are two choices.

4
00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.410
Android 5.1,
which is what the board comes with.

5
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.790
And if for some reason you decide to
change to Linux, you can do that.

6
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.730
Rerun Ubuntu on it.

7
00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:21.400
So you can switch between the two.

8
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.250
And we gonna cover in detail how you can

9
00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.440
flash the various operating
systems onto the board.

10
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.450
From the operating
system of your choice on

11
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.610
your laptop which can be
running Windows or Mac.
