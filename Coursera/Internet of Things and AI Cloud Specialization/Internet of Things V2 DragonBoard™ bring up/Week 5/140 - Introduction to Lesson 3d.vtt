Hello everyone, welcome to lesson 3D.

2
00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:10.500
Today we're going to talk to you about
flashing the Ubuntu operating system onto

3
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.850
your DragonBoard 410c using a host
PC on the Windows operating system.

4
00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.920
So, we wanna talk to you first about
where you're gonna go download the Ubuntu

5
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.960
operating system to get the binaries and
the bootloader.

6
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.880
>> Right, and
next we're gonna create a path variable.

7
00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.190
It's just a tool that's gonna allow
us to access the files quicker.

8
00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:30.990
>> Yeah,
finally we're going to update slightly,

9
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.450
the files that come with
the bootloader and the binaries, and

10
00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.350
then we're going to flash on
to your DragonBoard 410c.

11
00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.170
>> Yup, and with that we'll
see you in the next video and

12
00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:43.690
show you where to download
everything you need.
