00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.200
So that concludes Lesson One.

2
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.770
We basically went over what type
of operating systems we have

3
00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:09.720
available on the board as well as
how to install them onto the board.

4
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.970
So first off we went and explained what
the pros and cons are for Android.

5
00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:17.370
Such as, Android only being Java
specific so it's actually really,

6
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.290
really easy to get right into it.

7
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.710
But again, because it's so specific and
because there's a loss of control,

8
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.190
you basically are just very limited
in your Android experience.

9
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:31.120
>> And next we went over the pros and cons
for Ubuntu, or more specifically Linaro.

10
00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.412
And what we found out, or what we
concluded, was that it's more versatile in

11
00:00:35.412 --> 00:00:40.310
the sense that you can develop in
a wider variety of language and tools.

12
00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.710
And the only downside was that
there's a high learning curve and

13
00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.280
that some simple tasks might be a bit
more difficult to execute than usual.

14
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.500
>> And then we talked about
the different ways to install it.

15
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.740
One way is to use the SD Card,
which might take a little longer, but

16
00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:57.970
it's generally the easier route.

17
00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.222
You're just flashing one image in,
plugging it in.

18
00:01:00.222 --> 00:01:04.650
Whereas its fast boot, it might be a bit
faster and much speedier, but again, it's

19
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.070
a bit more difficult in the sense that you
need to know more of what you're doing

20
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.740
just to be safe that you don't somehow
fry your board from the software side.

21
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.450
Now do note that in the next eight videos,

22
00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:23.930
you can choose whichever one that you
need to use to help flash onto the board.

23
00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:24.930
But you can go ahead and

24
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.280
watch the other videos as well just
to kinda know what it's about.

25
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.810
>> And lastly,
though it's not currently available,

26
00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:37.115
Windows 10 would be released, I believe,
by the end of the current year.

27
00:01:37.115 --> 00:01:43.500
And so if you intend to download
Windows 10 on your DragonBoard,

28
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.650
be on the look out at 96boards.org
to check to see when those are out.
