00:00:02.292 --> 00:00:03.110
Hey, everyone.

2
00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.140
So, in this video, we’re gonna
show you everything that you’re

3
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.450
gonna wanna download and
where to download it.

4
00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.110
So we’re gonna take a look at Robert’s
screen, and he’ll guide you through it.

5
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:13.660
>> All right, yeah.

6
00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:20.490
So just like all of the other, I guess I
should say lessons in this module where

7
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.520
we take you to download everything, we're
gonna go to the 96boards.org website.

8
00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.280
As you can see here on the right side,
you have our DragonBoard 410c,

9
00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.320
the one and only.

10
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.170
And we're taking you over here.

11
00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.980
We're gonna go to the little
Downloads tab right here.

12
00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.860
And right underneath all
of this SD card images,

13
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.790
which we were also showing you in other
videos, we're gonna go to this little area

14
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:50.520
right here where you can see the Fastboot,
or SD recovery method area.

15
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.230
So we have a link here.

16
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.050
I'm gonna click on that, and that should
take us over to the wiki page, where

17
00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.690
there's plenty of information for you to
kind of sort through and dig around in.

18
00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.870
But we are going to only
be looking at the flashing,

19
00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.890
the boot loader, and images onto your
board, Android release right here.

20
00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.560
So let's go ahead and click here.

21
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.400
It's gonna take us down to
the bottom of the page.

22
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.410
And you can see that there's a few
files that we're gonna need to

23
00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:22.420
perform this task, first of which
is the Android bootloader ZIP file.

24
00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:23.460
So we're gonna click that.

25
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.890
That's gonna start downloading.

26
00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.370
We're gonna scroll down a little bit.

27
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.070
And these are all instructions
that you can actually follow also.

28
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.850
You can choose to follow these
instructions, you can choose to follow

29
00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.740
our video to a T, or you can actually
go to our documents as well, and

30
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.482
we're gonna walk you through all
these steps plenty of times.

31
00:01:39.482 --> 00:01:41.440
Now, you're gonna need
all these six files too.

32
00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.210
So I am gonna click all these.

33
00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.720
You can see them going
into my little downloads

34
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.440
folder there on the left-hand side.

35
00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.910
And look at that, they're all downloading.

36
00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.510
Some of them are already
done being downloaded.

37
00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.730
And once those are all done downloading
we're gonna unzip them all.

38
00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:04.228
And, in the next video we will show you
how to create the path variable to your

39
00:02:04.228 --> 00:02:09.180
Fastboot and modifying the script that
comes with one of those downloaded files.

40
00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.680
>> Yep.
>> Yep.
