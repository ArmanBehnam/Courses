00:00:01.963 --> 00:00:03.789
Hey everyone, so at this point,

2
00:00:03.789 --> 00:00:07.129
we're gonna show you how to do
two really important things.

3
00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:10.350
The first we're gonna show you is
how to create a path variable,

4
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.120
these things can be used for
anything you want.

5
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.006
So a path variable is a tool that will
allow you to go straight to a file without

6
00:00:17.006 --> 00:00:19.462
having to go to through
all the previous files.

7
00:00:19.462 --> 00:00:21.168
So you don't have to
traverse folder by folder,

8
00:00:21.168 --> 00:00:23.629
you can just go straight to your
destination using the path variable.

9
00:00:23.629 --> 00:00:27.212
The second thing we're gonna show you
how to do is, how to modify a script.

10
00:00:27.212 --> 00:00:31.253
Now, a script will allow you to execute
multiple commands on the command line,

11
00:00:31.253 --> 00:00:32.837
by just executing the script.

12
00:00:32.837 --> 00:00:35.171
So you dont have to go one by
one with each command there.

13
00:00:35.171 --> 00:00:37.705
And so Robert here,
we're gonna jump to his screen and

14
00:00:37.705 --> 00:00:39.920
he's gonna show you exactly
how to do all that.

15
00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.202
>> Yeah, first off,

16
00:00:41.202 --> 00:00:45.940
like to touch on what we kinda covered
at the very end of the last video.

17
00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.370
In the last video we
downloaded a bunch of files.

18
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.150
Now, all of those files you need to
make sure that you have those unzipped.

19
00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.263
And if you wanna stay a little
organized like I like to do is,

20
00:00:56.263 --> 00:00:59.587
I made a little folder here on my
desktop and called it android.

21
00:00:59.587 --> 00:01:04.046
I moved all of my files that I downloaded
into the boot loader file, and

22
00:01:04.046 --> 00:01:09.129
then I placed it into this nice, little,
conveniently named android folder.

23
00:01:09.129 --> 00:01:10.736
We'll go over that in a little bit, but

24
00:01:10.736 --> 00:01:13.879
first off I wanna create this path
variable that Yukresh was talking about.

25
00:01:13.879 --> 00:01:16.629
So, let's take a look
at the terminal here.

26
00:01:16.629 --> 00:01:23.546
And for Macs, you're going to need
to execute this commands right here.

27
00:01:23.546 --> 00:01:28.170
So I kind of have a little generic one
right there that I pasted up there.

28
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.962
But let's create one for us.

29
00:01:30.962 --> 00:01:34.754
Particularly for
where I can my FASTBOOT located.

30
00:01:34.754 --> 00:01:39.921
Now for me, I'm gonna go export and I
wanna call mine with lower case fastboot.

31
00:01:39.921 --> 00:01:41.088
And you will see why I do this later.

32
00:01:41.088 --> 00:01:46.379
But I'm gonna set my fastboot
variable equal to the home directory.

33
00:01:46.379 --> 00:01:51.087
And then I'm going to my, not Desktop,
I'm gonna go to my Library.

34
00:01:51.087 --> 00:01:54.773
Within my Library I have
a folder called android this

35
00:01:54.773 --> 00:01:57.046
is just where I put my fastboot.

36
00:01:57.046 --> 00:02:01.788
Inside my android folder,
I have my sdk and

37
00:02:01.788 --> 00:02:06.270
inside there is the platform-tools and

38
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.662
once and for all the fastboot execute.

39
00:02:10.662 --> 00:02:14.180
All right, so
if I hit enter here I should have created

40
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.080
a path variable to that
executable fastboot.

41
00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.270
Now, that being said,

42
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.610
I mentioned that I put all of these
files over here into this folder.

43
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.180
So, if we click this android here, and

44
00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.250
this was the boot loader
that I downloaded.

45
00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.540
Now, inside that boot loader I told you I
put all of those files that I unzipped.

46
00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:41.440
Well here you can see that I have my boot,
cache, persist,

47
00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.960
recovery, system and userdata.

48
00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.922
All of those were zipped, I unzipped them,
put them in my boot loader file.

49
00:02:46.922 --> 00:02:50.850
And you'll see why,
because this little file right here,

50
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.845
this flashall file,
is a very important executable script

51
00:02:55.845 --> 00:02:59.600
that's given to us by
the boot loader download.

52
00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.354
Now what we're gonna do is we are gonna
kind of guide our way into this folder

53
00:03:03.354 --> 00:03:04.796
through the terminal here.

54
00:03:04.796 --> 00:03:05.546
So lets do that.

55
00:03:05.546 --> 00:03:09.380
So the folder I am in right now, you
can see that I have Desktop right here.

56
00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.850
I am going to cd into the Desktop
because that is where my android

57
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.418
folder is located.

58
00:03:14.418 --> 00:03:16.790
Now that I'm in the android location,

59
00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.670
I can cd into that android and
look what is in there.

60
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.671
That one extra folder that makes
things extra difficult for me.

61
00:03:25.671 --> 00:03:27.379
>> cd, dragonboard.

62
00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:28.629
>> Oh, cd dragonboard.

63
00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:29.254
>> There you go.

64
00:03:29.254 --> 00:03:30.960
>> Okay, so now i'm in there right?

65
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:31.640
>> Yeah.
>> Okay cool,

66
00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.400
so you can see that
little flashall folder.

67
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.530
I have a text editor that I
like to use which is just vim,

68
00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.379
all Macs should come with that.

69
00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:39.004
>> All Macs have it.

70
00:03:39.004 --> 00:03:45.090
>> But yeah so if I go into flashall
you can see this script that was so

71
00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.379
nicely given to us by 96 boards.

72
00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:49.629
>> By 96 ports, yeah.

73
00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:54.532
>> Yeah, so now what we wanna do is we
wanna flash everything from here onto

74
00:03:54.532 --> 00:03:56.421
the Dragonboard 410c.

75
00:03:56.421 --> 00:04:00.844
In order to do we need to hit I,
that allows me to insert.

76
00:04:00.844 --> 00:04:04.297
But we need to include a little-
>> $ there.

77
00:04:04.297 --> 00:04:09.212
And as an you can see on the screen there,
theres a bunch of commands there.

78
00:04:09.212 --> 00:04:13.180
And each one is its own command but
by putting it all executable,

79
00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.545
you can just execute the executable.

80
00:04:15.545 --> 00:04:18.880
And it'll just run the commands for you so
you don't have to type each one out.

81
00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.083
And the reason he's putting that
$ in front of that fastboot is,

82
00:04:22.083 --> 00:04:24.821
if you remember back to when
we made that path variable,

83
00:04:24.821 --> 00:04:28.337
we created a path variable called
fastboot and it was all in lowercase.

84
00:04:28.337 --> 00:04:32.336
So here your gonna see that the fastboot
path variable is also in lowercase.

85
00:04:32.336 --> 00:04:37.671
And by putting a $ we're actually
calling that path variable.

86
00:04:37.671 --> 00:04:41.717
So $ goes to that path variable,
calls on the fastboot executable,

87
00:04:41.717 --> 00:04:44.928
calls on the function inside
that executable flash and

88
00:04:44.928 --> 00:04:48.330
flash is that the appropriate file is on.

89
00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.772
>> One little extra step
that we took here, was that,

90
00:04:51.772 --> 00:04:55.730
like I said earlier, I said I unzipped
these and threw these in this folder.

91
00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:58.270
Well I want this to do a little more for
me.

92
00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.550
I know it's already gonna do a lot,
but I want it to do more.

93
00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.020
So what I did is I kind of wrote
a little extra bit right here.

94
00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.766
So you can see that I took
these commands right here, and

95
00:05:07.766 --> 00:05:10.171
they're erasing what's
already on the board.

96
00:05:10.171 --> 00:05:15.020
Well, I want to use those same
commands to give me a little more.

97
00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.660
And that's essentially going
to erase everything and

98
00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:21.420
then reflash all of these
extra files here now.

99
00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:24.750
If I didn't put this in here,
you could just go individually and

100
00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:28.080
flash one by one onto your board.

101
00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.110
But this is gonna make
things a little quicker.

102
00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:36.150
So if you want, right now, you can pause
the video and open up your flashall.

103
00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:40.280
Copy this section over
here onto your script.

104
00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.337
And then what you do invent at least, and
you can always look up these commands.

105
00:05:43.337 --> 00:05:45.700
Oh yeah, actually, good point Yukresh.

106
00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.760
So yeah, we also need to add these
$ because it is a path variable.

107
00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.200
So, let's get those in there real quick.

108
00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.050
Should've included that
in the copy paste part.

109
00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:56.296
All right, so
now that we got all that in there.

110
00:05:56.296 --> 00:05:58.530
You can go online, look up vin commands.

111
00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:00.650
But yeah, so
basically your gonna hit escape.

112
00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:05.587
Then you're gonna do colon and
then w for write, and q for quit.

113
00:06:05.587 --> 00:06:10.501
You can hit enter so you officially
updated your flashall script

114
00:06:10.501 --> 00:06:14.330
there to run all of the commands
you want it to run.

115
00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:15.080
>> Yep, yeah.

116
00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.070
>> Yeah, so let's execute that.

117
00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:22.073
>> Wait, so actually, we'll see you on
the next video, and we'll actually show

118
00:06:22.073 --> 00:06:26.940
you how to execute each of the files
onto the thing, onto the dragging board.

119
00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:28.587
>> I was kinda jumping the gun there,
but yeah.

120
00:06:28.587 --> 00:06:29.660
Okay, we'll see you next video.
