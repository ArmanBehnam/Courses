00:00:04.641 --> 00:00:09.284
Okay, we're ready now to go onto the
96Boards website and get our binaries and

2
00:00:09.284 --> 00:00:11.880
our boot loader for the Ubuntu image.

3
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.390
>> All right, so, stick with me here guys,
it's gonna be a bunch of link copying.

4
00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.200
So we're gonna go into our browser.

5
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.470
Type in 96boards.org.

6
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.440
And then the first link that's gonna come
up, is the one that we're gonna click on.

7
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.530
So, let's click on that.

8
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:30.510
And it's gonna take a second for
it to come up.

9
00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:33.780
>> We're on the campus internet.

10
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:34.410
>> Yeah.
>> [LAUGH].

11
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.160
>> Take a little longer.

12
00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.230
And here we go.

13
00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.041
And as soon as we go to the website,

14
00:00:40.041 --> 00:00:44.110
you'll see a blue micro-controller
here called the DragonBoard 410C.

15
00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.220
We're gonna click on that.

16
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.952
And then we're gonna
click on downloads here.

17
00:00:48.952 --> 00:00:52.550
We're gonna scroll down past
the latest microSD card images.

18
00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.180
And then you're gonna see a small
link here that says, wiki pages here.

19
00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.860
So we want to click on that.

20
00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.700
And it's gonna take you
to a GitHub.com website.

21
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.590
So we're gonna scroll down that.

22
00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.420
And then we're gonna click on install
android or Ubuntu using flashboot.

23
00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.390
So once we click on that,
you're gonna scroll down.

24
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.120
You're gonna see a section called
Install Linaro/Ubuntu release.

25
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.850
So you want to go into that section.

26
00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.830
You'll see a link that says, download the
latest Ubuntu bootloader zip located here.

27
00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.830
So click on that blue thing there.

28
00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.210
>> You'll notice also like on this page,
there's lots of other resources.

29
00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.670
I'd recommend checking
everything else out as well.

30
00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:29.420
>> Yeah.

31
00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.330
>> What he's downloading right now.

32
00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.450
Is one of several files you're
gonna actually have to download so.

33
00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.120
>> So this is the bootloader here,
and all of these files will be zipped.

34
00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.250
And on the same page, you'll find
instructions to how to unzip them too, so

35
00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.110
you can take a look at that.

36
00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.880
And then the second thing we
wanna download is the boot image.

37
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.980
And it says right here, for the latest
Ubuntu boot image, we wanna click here.

38
00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.540
We want to click on that one.

39
00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.830
And then, the last one we want to click on
is, we're gonna skip the next blue here.

40
00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.830
We're gonna go to the one that says,
the graphical X version based on LXDE,

41
00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.680
and we're gonna click on that one.

42
00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.730
That's the root file system, and
that's a very important file, so

43
00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.330
you wanna click on that to get
the graphical interface of Ubuntu.

44
00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.450
And those are the three
files you're gonna need.

45
00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.950
That's basically everything you're
gonna need to start fast booting

46
00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.310
Linaro onto a Dragon board.

47
00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.050
>> Yeah, the Ubuntu operating system
comes in two different kinds of

48
00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.990
operating systems.

49
00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.450
One, which is the command line only.

50
00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.260
That's more for

51
00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.994
just direct communication with the board,
developing Kind of hard core coders there.

52
00:02:29.994 --> 00:02:32.270
>> Yeah.
>> Then you have the graphical interface

53
00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.340
one, which he is talking about,
which is the ALIP version.

54
00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.030
And you can find out a little bit more
about this reading into the release notes

55
00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.730
on the downloads page, where you can
see the Ubuntu and the Android links.

56
00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.020
But, yeah, it's definitely important
that you get the desktop version,

57
00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.640
because that's the version we're
actually gonna be using in

58
00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.900
this whole specialization,
the desktop version.

59
00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.540
>> It's much easier to look at too and
work with, so we're gonna use that one.

60
00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.100
And we'll see you in the next video, and

61
00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.690
show you how to create path variables
to whatever you need to access.
