Hey everyone.

2
00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:09.130
Welcome back, and now we're gonna
download the Win32 Disk Imager.

3
00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:09.650
>> All right.

4
00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:15.220
So, we're gonna go ahead and go to Google,
and just look up the Win32 disk imager.

5
00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:20.420
>> The first link that comes up is the
sourceforge.net, and it's a pretty common

6
00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.790
website to download the Win32 Disk Imager,
so you can go ahead and click on that.

7
00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.470
>> Oh, by the way, Ucrish,
what does this do?

8
00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.120
>> So, the Win32 Disk Imager is a tool for

9
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.840
writing images onto SD
cards of USB sticks.

10
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.639
So, on the website we're gonna see a green
box, and we're just gonna click download.

11
00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.570
Once this starts downloading,
we're gonna install it onto our computer,

12
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.840
and we'll see you in the next section,

13
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.190
and we'll start flashing
the images onto the SD card.
