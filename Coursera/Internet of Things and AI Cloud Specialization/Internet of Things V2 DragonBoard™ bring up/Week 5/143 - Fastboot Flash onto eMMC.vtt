1
00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.770
At this point in the lesson, we've already
taken you to the website, 96boads.org.

2
00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:12.610
We've showed you how to download
the proper files that you need,

3
00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:15.190
the bootloader, the binaries,
all the images.

4
00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.920
We then walked you through
creating a path variable to

5
00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.120
the fastboot location in your SDK.

6
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.320
>> Yeah.
>> You've already done all this before but

7
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.150
we just wanted to walk you
through it one more time.

8
00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.250
Now it's time to boot the board into fast
boot and get the image onto the board.

9
00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:34.822
>> Yeah
>> Let's take a look over here and

10
00:00:34.822 --> 00:00:37.763
first of all it's important to make
sure it's not powered on right.

11
00:00:37.763 --> 00:00:42.760
But what we are also going to make
sure of is that it's in the right boot

12
00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.999
configuration, and
that's making sure it is 0000.

13
00:00:46.999 --> 00:00:48.497
That's four times right?

14
00:00:48.497 --> 00:00:49.554
>> Yeah.
>> 00, all right.

15
00:00:49.554 --> 00:00:51.343
[LAUGH]
>> All of these switches should be set at

16
00:00:51.343 --> 00:00:52.360
0 on the back, yeah.

17
00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.190
>> Yeah.
[COUGH] Excellent.

18
00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.620
So now that we have all that set up and we
have our keyboard and mouse hooked in and

19
00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.930
our micro USB plugged in, our HDMI
plugged in, we are set to boot it up.

20
00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.610
>> Yep.
>> But, from what you learned in

21
00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:04.400
a previous lesson,

22
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.270
we need to make sure that we hold our
finger on the little minus button here.

23
00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.050
>> Located next to the USB ports there.

24
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.340
>> Yeah that's going to ensure
that we boot it into fast boot.

25
00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.096
And then we're going to power it on.

26
00:01:17.096 --> 00:01:18.110
So power it on.

27
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.190
Now we've noticed the sweet spot to get it
into fast boot is not to hold it on for

28
00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.180
too long, ten seconds is about right.

29
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.210
>> Yeah.
>> So by the end of this sentence

30
00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:27.660
I'm gonna let it go.

31
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:28.330
All right, there we go.

32
00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.310
>> So
now the board should be in fast boot.

33
00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.110
And the best way to check if it's in fast
boot is go back into your terminal, and

34
00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.690
remember the path variable
that you created before, so

35
00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.740
now we're gonna use that path variable.

36
00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.830
We're just gonna type
in %fastboot% devices.

37
00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.950
Boom you get a little code there and
that code is for the DragonBoard, and

38
00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.810
it's telling me that the DragonBoard
is in the fast boot mode.

39
00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.770
So now we're ready to start
flashing stuff on there.

40
00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.030
>> And essentially, just to reiterate as
many times as possible, when he's doing

41
00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.920
this fast boot command, the path variable-
>> What he set it as,

42
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.460
if you remember,
was the fast boot executable.

43
00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:08.600
>> Yeah.
>> So, whats happening is,

44
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.280
is he's essentially performing
the fast boot executable and

45
00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.000
then calling the device command.

46
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.300
So he's using the device command
with the fast boot executable.

47
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.530
>> Yeah it's a good thing
you touched on that.

48
00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:19.350
>> Yeah.

49
00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.900
>> So now it's time to take a look back at

50
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.790
that script we were looking at last time,
right?

51
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:24.380
>> Yes.
So,

52
00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.750
if you remember in the previous video, we
modified a script called flash all file.

53
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.830
And so we put percentage signs
around all the fastboots.

54
00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.490
And here's a very important
note to keep in mind,

55
00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.375
you wanna save the file as flashall.bat.

56
00:02:40.375 --> 00:02:43.890
You want to slave it as a flashall.bat.

57
00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.330
That's the correct extension
to actually use that file.

58
00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:49.260
To use that script.

59
00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.410
So we're going to click yes.

60
00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.520
And now the file is in to correct format,
so we're ready to go.

61
00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.110
So now what we're gonna do is go straight
to the file that we downloaded the boot

62
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.400
loader, the boot image, the root fs image,
we're gonna go into that folder here.

63
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.820
So let's see, users,
going to go to Desktop,

64
00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.340
in that,
there's another folder called linaro.

65
00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.330
There we go.

66
00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.050
And if you see here, we have all of
the files Satyung downloaded before,

67
00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.280
all unzipped and ready to go.

68
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.910
>> Including the flashall.bat.

69
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.440
>> Yep, and so what we're going to do,

70
00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.570
is we're just going to simply type
in the name of that file there.

71
00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.570
>> That's going to execute it, basically.

72
00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:28.520
And what you see on the screen there is,

73
00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.710
it's performing each individual
one of those flashes for us.

74
00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:35.560
And if we didn't have that script,
we would have had to do that one by one.

75
00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:36.320
>> Yeah, yeah.

76
00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.930
>> Which is kind of a pain in the butt.

77
00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.782
>> So now it's all ready to go and
the boot loader is now on the DragonBoard.

78
00:03:42.782 --> 00:03:47.360
Now if you remember we also downloaded two
other files, the boot image file and then

79
00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.610
the ALIP root FS image file, the graphical
interface for the root file system.

80
00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.100
So what we're gonna do is use
that same path label there,

81
00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.270
fast boot,
we're going to type in flash boot.

82
00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:04.040
And then we're going to type in the name
of that boot image file, so it's going to

83
00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:09.170
say boot-linaro-vivid, Hawking standard,
snapdragon, and we're going to click OK.

84
00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.670
And this is going to boot the image
file onto the DragonBoard,

85
00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.890
It's already done, and
now we're gonna go here.

86
00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:19.492
Next we gonna download the rootfs system.

87
00:04:22.617 --> 00:04:30.530
So here we go, flash rootfs, and
we're gonna have another file.

88
00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:31.710
>> Starts with linaro.

89
00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.330
>> Starts with linaro there,
yep, thank you.

90
00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.880
What you want to make sure about this file
is, and I think Muchresh touched on it,

91
00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.050
but, is that it's in ALIP.

92
00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.350
So, ALIP and you can see this, I think
I mentioned this in the last video, but

93
00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:48.400
ALIP you can read more about it in
the release notes under the Ubuntu

94
00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.847
download link,
on the 96 boards downloads page, for

95
00:04:51.847 --> 00:04:55.450
the DragonBoard 410C
>> Yeah, there you go

96
00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.220
>> But yeah, anyways,

97
00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.110
that's the file you want to do if you
want the desktop version of the Ubuntu.

98
00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.250
>> Yeah, so
we are going to play enter there, and

99
00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:05.860
its going to start downloading it.

100
00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.180
And there you go, so once that
finishes downloading you now have

101
00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.990
the root file system on your DragonBoard,
the boot image file on your DragonBoard,

102
00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.520
you have the boot loader,
you have everything on your DragonBoard.

103
00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.860
And the DragonBoard now has
a Lenora operating system on it.

104
00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.130
>> Yeah.
>> You can just plug out the Micro USB and

105
00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:25.720
reboot it on to the Lenora
operating system.

106
00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.680
>> Yeah.
What's usually recommended is,

107
00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.080
don't worry about how you boot this down.

108
00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.750
Well I mean, right now it's
finishing writing the files.

109
00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:36.890
But you can just unplug it,
unplug the micro USB like Uker said and

110
00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:37.850
then just plug it back in.

111
00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:39.430
It should boot right into your Ubuntu.

112
00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:40.760
>> Yep, there you go.

113
00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.940
>> All right, we'll see you in later-
>> Videos

114
00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:45.884
