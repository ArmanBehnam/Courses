Hello everyone, and
welcome to this section.

2
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.650
Here we'll be defining
what a bricked board is.

3
00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:12.170
And so a bricked board is essentially
a board that doesn't work, and

4
00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:14.870
currently we classify them in two types.

5
00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:16.570
So there's a soft brick, and

6
00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:22.370
as you can kind of surmise that a soft
brick would be a board whose software or

7
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.730
operating system is preventing it
from functioning or turning on.

8
00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.660
>> And then there's a hard brick,

9
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.290
which is essentially something on the
board where the hardware is fried, whether

10
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:36.310
it's a component or just something's wrong
with the hardware components on the board.

11
00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.140
And it's just preventing you
from even turning it on or

12
00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.590
even accessing any of the software.

13
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.300
>> Now depending on
which kind of errors or

14
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.480
which kind of bricking your board is
currently facing, if you stayed tuned,

15
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.200
in the next section we'll give you
some troubleshooting problems,

16
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.310
some troubleshooting tips to perhaps
try to get it to work again.
