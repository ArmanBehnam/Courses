00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:08.327
Shorting the board, this actually ends
up being one of the most damaging and

2
00:00:08.327 --> 00:00:13.271
possibly irreversible situation that you
could have with your DragonBoard 410C.

3
00:00:13.271 --> 00:00:18.464
Now, most cases, when you end up shorting
your board, it's usually because you ended

4
00:00:18.464 --> 00:00:23.377
up either sending too much voltage through
it, or messing too much with the GPIOs,

5
00:00:23.377 --> 00:00:28.430
or things that you might not have had too
much control over in the first place.

6
00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:30.700
We wanna kind of go over that and

7
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.130
tell you different ways to
prevent that from happening.

8
00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.667
>> So usually, a common case is
either having an abrupt shutdown or

9
00:00:37.667 --> 00:00:39.311
putting in a higher voltage.

10
00:00:39.311 --> 00:00:43.090
So, make sure when you shut down your
board, you do it the recommended way,

11
00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:44.700
through the operating system.

12
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.090
Go shut down, log off, or whatever.

13
00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.552
And then, when you're connecting it, make
sure you use the specified voltage and

14
00:00:53.552 --> 00:00:55.541
amperage that the DragonBoard has.

15
00:00:55.541 --> 00:00:58.280
So I believe it's five volt,
three amperes?

16
00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.886
>> Well, so actually, we've talked about
it in other lessons, but this DC jack is

17
00:01:02.886 --> 00:01:06.841
capable of handling a range of 6.5
volts all the way to 18 volts.

18
00:01:06.841 --> 00:01:12.321
Yeah, and the amp bridge is 2 Amps or
2,000 mA.

19
00:01:12.321 --> 00:01:18.004
So, I believe in the packages that
are available to you on the website.

20
00:01:18.004 --> 00:01:22.784
You will have an option of choosing
the DC adapter that you would like.

21
00:01:22.784 --> 00:01:26.970
And this is all gonna be depending on the
projects you're gonna be running because

22
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.914
the options you have on your expansion
header will give you those DC outputs to

23
00:01:30.914 --> 00:01:32.067
create amplifiers and

24
00:01:32.067 --> 00:01:35.911
all sorts of cool stuff that you'll end
up doing later on in these courses.

25
00:01:35.911 --> 00:01:38.951
>> So, not how he said, 6.5 to 18.

26
00:01:38.951 --> 00:01:39.570
>> Yeah.

27
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.391
>> Don't do anything above 18,
or else you will fry some stuff.

28
00:01:42.391 --> 00:01:43.911
>> Yeah.

29
00:01:43.911 --> 00:01:46.030
As well as the amperage
is also very important.

30
00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.514
And as he mentioned, when you unplug this,
if you happen to be running

31
00:01:50.514 --> 00:01:55.454
something important on the board,
if you just completely cut the power off,

32
00:01:55.454 --> 00:01:58.722
maybe there was an operation
didn't get finish and

33
00:01:58.722 --> 00:02:01.620
that could end up screwing
things up as well.
