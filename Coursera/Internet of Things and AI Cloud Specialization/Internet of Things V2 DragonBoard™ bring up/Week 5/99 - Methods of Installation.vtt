00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:03.210
Now that we've given you both the pros and

2
00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.300
the cons of the Android operating system
and Linaro or Ubuntu operating system.

3
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.950
Let's go ahead and
dive in as to how to install those or

4
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.170
at least the methods of installation for
your DragonBoard.

5
00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.410
>> Now, the DragonBoard site,
or rather 96Boards.org site,

6
00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.070
offers two different types of ways to
install your images onto the board.

7
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.150
One is via the SD card, which is
essentially flashing some sort of SD card

8
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.890
onto, or
flashing an image onto your SD card, and

9
00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.280
then just plugging it straight
into your DragonBoard.

10
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.100
Or using the fast group protocol
that we went through in module two.

11
00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:38.755
And as you can see in the slide,
we linked to you or

12
00:00:38.755 --> 00:00:40.967
at least we reference you to the
appropriate lesson regarding whether or

13
00:00:40.967 --> 00:00:42.940
not you want to install the android or
Ubuntu/Linaro version.

14
00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.580
>> And if you want to go about doing it
either on your Mac/ Linux computer or

15
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:54.940
your windows.

16
00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.240
So ultimately there's eight
different possibilities here.

17
00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.540
There's either if you're a Mac user or
a Windows user.

18
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.325
If you wanna have Android or
Linaro on your board and

19
00:01:04.325 --> 00:01:07.870
then which method of installation,
the SD card or the fast boot.

20
00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:12.330
So we highly recommend you just figure
out which of these constraints you fall

21
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.910
under and just watch those videos,
otherwise you'll see a lot of repetition.

22
00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.490
It's just basically the same thing over
and over again, just slightly tweaked for

23
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.620
every single platform or method.

24
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.960
>> However, do feel free to watch
the other videos as well if you want to,

25
00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:32.300
perhaps, learn different methods to
install the operating system and,

26
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.270
with that, we'll see you in
the summary and lesson look back.
