00:00:05.051 --> 00:00:05.551
Welcome back.

2
00:00:05.551 --> 00:00:09.230
In this section, we're gonna go over and
show you on how to finally rescue your

3
00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:11.701
DragonBoard, and
reflash your operating system.

4
00:00:11.701 --> 00:00:14.392
>> So from the previous section,

5
00:00:14.392 --> 00:00:19.680
we just finished flashing
the rescue image onto our SD card.

6
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.980
So what you wanna do is
you wanna take that out.

7
00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.160
First, you have to make sure that
it is unmounted and it should be.

8
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.560
And because the DragonBoard
only takes micro SD cards,

9
00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.350
we're going to go ahead and
take that like little thing, right?

10
00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.840
And before you go about
rescuing your board,

11
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.050
you want to make sure first
that it is plugged off.

12
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.070
>> So there's no plug here.

13
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:49.371
And then what you want to do next
is go ahead and turn it over.

14
00:00:49.371 --> 00:00:51.491
Remember, the switch is back here.

15
00:00:51.491 --> 00:00:54.360
You want to go ahead and
put it into SD boot mode.

16
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.060
So if you want to go ahead and do it,
should be the second one from down.

17
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.041
>> Oh, it's already to go.

18
00:01:04.041 --> 00:01:04.801
>> All right.

19
00:01:04.801 --> 00:01:08.010
Notice here that the SD
boot is already in.

20
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.970
So all we have to do now
is plug in the SD card.

21
00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.260
All right.
Now, let's plug it in.

22
00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.924
Before I do that,
I am going to go ahead and

23
00:01:17.924 --> 00:01:20.600
include the USB cable into the OTG drive.

24
00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.900
>> And plug this into my computer,
stay on this side.

25
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.580
>> Before you plug it in,
cuz I know sometimes it gives power.

26
00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.769
So first, I'll power it on, and then.

27
00:01:32.769 --> 00:01:35.021
All right.

28
00:01:35.021 --> 00:01:36.790
Now, let's go ahead and
go to your computer.

29
00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.884
>> So, right now, I'm currently
at the directory where my fast

30
00:01:42.884 --> 00:01:47.661
boot is located, so
which can do a quick fast boot devices.

31
00:01:47.661 --> 00:01:51.213
And as you can see here, the SD card and

32
00:01:51.213 --> 00:01:57.550
what the configuration we did
boots the board into fast boot.

33
00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.325
At this point, go ahead, if you haven't
done so already, reference module

34
00:02:02.325 --> 00:02:07.111
four on flashing your operating system for
your given image using fast boot.

35
00:02:07.111 --> 00:02:09.159
Note that because we have
the SD card in there,

36
00:02:09.159 --> 00:02:10.901
we can only use fast boot at this point.

37
00:02:10.901 --> 00:02:15.216
So, if you're on Android or Linux, you're
going to have to follow procedures for

38
00:02:15.216 --> 00:02:16.830
flashing them on to the board.
