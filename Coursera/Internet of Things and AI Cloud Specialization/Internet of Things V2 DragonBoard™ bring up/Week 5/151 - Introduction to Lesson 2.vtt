Welcome to Lesson 2.

2
00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:03.803
In this lesson, Ari and

3
00:00:03.803 --> 00:00:07.157
I will be going over how you can
potential rescue your bricked board.

4
00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:09.170
>> So first off, we'll go ahead and

5
00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.300
show you the location where to
download the recovery image.

6
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.049
>> Next,
we'll show you how to flash the rescue or

7
00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:16.985
recovery image on to the SD card.

8
00:00:16.985 --> 00:00:18.375
And then, we'll go ahead and

9
00:00:18.375 --> 00:00:21.663
tell you what steps to take in order
to recover your operating system.

10
00:00:21.663 --> 00:00:24.292
>> Now do note by rescuing
your bricked board,

11
00:00:24.292 --> 00:00:28.440
this is geared more towards
the operating system side.

12
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.400
>> Yeah, usually if you have a hard brick,
it's kind of the end of the road for you.

13
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.400
You need to do some major
fixes to the board.
