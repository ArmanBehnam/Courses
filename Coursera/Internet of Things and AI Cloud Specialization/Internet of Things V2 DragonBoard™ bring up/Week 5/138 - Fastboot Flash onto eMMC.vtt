00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:08.026
At this point in the game, we've already
walked you through the process of

2
00:00:08.026 --> 00:00:12.490
downloading all of the files that you
need, the binaries and the boot loaders.

3
00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.200
We also taught you how to
make your path variable,

4
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.590
which you've already learned I think
a couple times before in previous lessons.

5
00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.820
And now it's time to actually
boot your board into fast boot,

6
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.590
and get the stuff flashed over.

7
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.515
So, first off, you want to make sure
your board is unplugged or powered down.

8
00:00:31.515 --> 00:00:34.550
Secondly, you want to make sure that
you're in the right boot configuration.

9
00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.100
So, by flipping your board over you can
see that you have your dip switches

10
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.430
right here, all four of them.

11
00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.300
They need to be in the zero,
zero, zero, zero position.

12
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.217
This is away from the board, so
you can kind of see right there I hope.

13
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:48.800
Now that we have all of that set up,

14
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.480
we want to make sure that we have our
host PC hooked into the micro USB port.

15
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.030
Our HDMI port is plugged in because once
we flash over to the new operating system,

16
00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.010
we want to, you know,
make sure it boots up.

17
00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.630
And then we also have
this little dongle here,

18
00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:03.730
which controls our keyboard and our mouse.

19
00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.450
So in a previous lesson, you did
learn how to boot it into fast boot,

20
00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.440
but what we're going to do is
we're going to do it again here.

21
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.760
So by holding the minus sign button,
there's three buttons, the power,

22
00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.072
the plus, and the minus.

23
00:01:14.072 --> 00:01:16.270
We're gonna hold down
the minus sign button, and

24
00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.020
we're going to plug in the adapter here,
the power adapter.

25
00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.410
And we've found that a sweet
spot is about ten seconds.

26
00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.880
So you hold onto the button for
about ten seconds, and

27
00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.100
you should boot into fast boot.

28
00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:28.940
And you, Chris Shears,
can actually prove it.

29
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:30.430
So we should be in fast boot now.

30
00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:31.639
We're gonna look at his screen, and

31
00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:33.640
we're gonna actually prove
that we're in fast boot.

32
00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.800
>> So a very easy way to
check if it's in fast boot is

33
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.860
go back to the same path variable we
had to the fast boot path variable.

34
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.810
And I'm calling on the path variable again
by putting percentage signs around it.

35
00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.810
One of the commands that the fast boot
has is this thing called device, and

36
00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.880
it tells you which devices
are plugged in fast boot.

37
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.360
I'm going to click enter, and
I see a little code there.

38
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.394
And that code is for the DragonBoard, and

39
00:01:55.394 --> 00:01:59.040
it's basically telling me that
the DragonoBoard is in fast boot mode.

40
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.397
So the next thing I want to do here is,

41
00:02:01.397 --> 00:02:04.451
remember that file we
created with the script?

42
00:02:04.451 --> 00:02:07.770
That's gonna allow us to flash
everything at the same time.

43
00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.660
So you're going to go here and let's see.

44
00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.120
So you're going to add in the new.

45
00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.990
>> You can see actually
you already have that in.

46
00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.690
So in your other script that you had that
we did at the end of the last video.

47
00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.900
All we had was the boot recovery
system user data, so on.

48
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:25.690
>> Right.

49
00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:26.860
>> The commands essentially.

50
00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.220
>> We had all this here,
all the way down to the erase part.

51
00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.230
So we downloaded all
the boot loader stuff, and

52
00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.620
then we erased the previous
installation pause there.

53
00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.160
And then what we want to do is instead of,
if you remember back,

54
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.720
we also downloaded a bunch of other files
called boot, recovery system and all that.

55
00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.450
Instead of having to flash each
of those files independently,

56
00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.040
we can just append that
onto the script file.

57
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.520
And then the script file will
flash those things also.

58
00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.430
After the erase file,

59
00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.780
you just want to copy that third
chunk there, and paste it again.

60
00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:05.660
And, you want to replace the word that
says erase, and replace it with flash.

61
00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.230
Then, you want to type in boot.

62
00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.720
And then the name of the boot file.

63
00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:09.320
The boot.image.

64
00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.662
You want to type in recovery.

65
00:03:10.662 --> 00:03:12.117
Recovery.image.

66
00:03:12.117 --> 00:03:13.380
System, system.image.

67
00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.380
And you just want to go down the line
there for user data, cash, device info,

68
00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:18.630
and then the persist.

69
00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.420
So now you have six commands there, and
these six commands will actually flash

70
00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.020
those image files onto
the DragonBoard in just one go.

71
00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.040
You just run the script file,
everything will get flashed on, so

72
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.080
let's start doing that now.

73
00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.790
>> Yeah, also if you're confused, or
if you don't know what you're doing,

74
00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.402
just pause the video right now and
just copy that.

75
00:03:37.402 --> 00:03:38.810
>> Yeah.
>> So you can just copy

76
00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:39.470
that into your file.

77
00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.320
>> Pause the video, copy,
type it in exactly as you see it.

78
00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.940
And so we're going to go into
our command prompt again, and

79
00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.530
we're gonna, now you want to go into the
file that has all your boot loaders and

80
00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.390
the other image files downloaded.

81
00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:54.019
So you want to go into cd.

82
00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:56.460
I'm gonna go into my users here.

83
00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.800
And then my Desktop.

84
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.370
And then I have it saved in a file called
android, so I'm gonna go into that.

85
00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.820
And then if I click DIR I'm gonna see
all the files that I downloaded here.

86
00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.140
It has everything here.

87
00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.140
And another very important thing I
wanted to add is that when you're

88
00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:18.010
saving this file,
you wanna save it as a .bat file.

89
00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.560
So the file will be
initially in flashall and

90
00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.038
it's very,
very important that you do flashall.bat.

91
00:04:26.038 --> 00:04:29.150
If it's not in .bat file it won't run.

92
00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.000
So make sure it's in flashall.bat.

93
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.960
And now everything's ready to go.

94
00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:33.640
>> Well, why don't you.

95
00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.920
Yeah, there actually you can
see the .bat file right there.

96
00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.110
>> Yeah, so
you can see that it's popped up there.

97
00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.670
And then all we have
to do is Flashall.bat,

98
00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:45.870
that's all we have to do now, and
voila, everything's happening here.

99
00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.220
Every single file that we downloaded is
being flashed onto the DragonBoard, and

100
00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.130
the boot loader, all the image files.

101
00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:56.030
And so what's gonna happen is you're
now gonna have a fully functional

102
00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.380
Android operating system
on your DragonBoard.

103
00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:59.220
Isn't that awesome right?

104
00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.060
So you're gonna have that there,

105
00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.870
and hopefully you'll have
it on your DragonBoard too.

106
00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.590
And if you have any problems,
you can refer to our documentation.

107
00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.710
Hopefully we'll see you
guys on our future videos.
