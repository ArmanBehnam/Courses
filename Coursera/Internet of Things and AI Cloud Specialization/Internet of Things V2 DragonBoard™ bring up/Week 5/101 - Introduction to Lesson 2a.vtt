Hello everyone and welcome to lesson 2a.

2
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:09.330
In this lesson, Randy and I will be going
over how to download the Android OS into

3
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.144
an SD card so you that can
flash it onto your DragonBoard.

4
00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.760
So in this lesson, we'll first show you
where to download the Android image.

5
00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.640
And next we'll show you, we'll create
the path variable to the Android image so

6
00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.550
that when you flash the micro
SD card with the image,

7
00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.710
it's a bit easier to navigate through,
right?

8
00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:28.210
>> Yeah.

9
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.810
Then afterwords we're gonna go ahead and
flash the SD card with the image

10
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.820
onto the DragonBoard for you to install
the operating system that you want.

11
00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:38.990
In this case, Android.

12
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.820
>> And so stay tuned, and
we'll see you in the next section.
