Hey everyone.

2
00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:02.400
Welcome back.

3
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.450
I hope you enjoyed everything
we just showed you.

4
00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:10.160
Now that you have successfully installed
a Android system onto a DragonBoard,

5
00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.470
let's take a short look back and
see what we exactly did.

6
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:15.660
>> So the first thing we went ahead and

7
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.120
did was download the Android
images off the 96boards website.

8
00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.640
>> Next, we download the win32diskimager,
and like we said before,

9
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.350
it's just a tool that will allow us to
write the .image file onto the SD card.

10
00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.900
>> So after unzipping those Android images
file and installing the win32diskimager,

11
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:39.560
we use the win32diskimager to
write the images onto the SD card.

12
00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.790
And lastly once the SD Card was
flashed with the operating system,

13
00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.880
we took the SD Card,
we inserted into the Dragonboard, and

14
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.220
we booted it up with the new
operating system on the Dragonboard.

15
00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.880
And now we have the Android
operating system on the Dragonboard.

16
00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.230
>> So with that all done,
hopefully you guys can

17
00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.900
use you new Android DragonBoard
to make some cool apps.

18
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:05.900
Have fun with it.

19
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.320
>> Yeah.
>> I don't know.

20
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.720
>> There's a lot of cool things you can
do with the Android operating system, so

21
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.810
I hope to see you on future lessons.
