00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.690
So, let's now summarize and take a look
back at what we learned in Lesson 2A.

2
00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:07.140
>> So first, we went ahead and

3
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.260
downloaded the Android image
off the 96boards.org website.

4
00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:14.910
>> And then we created the path
variable to the said Android image so

5
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.960
that we can reference it
more easily later on.

6
00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.880
>> Afterwards, we went ahead and
flashed the image onto the microSD card.

7
00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.050
>> And lastly, we installed
the Android operating system onto

8
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.040
the DragonBoard using the SD card method.

9
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.585
And with that in mind, that kind of
wraps up this installation guide and

10
00:00:32.585 --> 00:00:35.844
hopefully you're able to
kinda follow us along and

11
00:00:35.844 --> 00:00:40.343
now your DragonBoard 410C has
the most up to date Android version.
