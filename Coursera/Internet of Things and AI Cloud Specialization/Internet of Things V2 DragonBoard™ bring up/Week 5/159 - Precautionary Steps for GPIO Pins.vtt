00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:04.280
There are a variety of precautionary
steps you wanna take when

2
00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.110
using the GPIOs on the expansion header.

3
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:12.090
This is very important because
voltage can be sent in and

4
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.110
sent out from this
interface on your board.

5
00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.900
Now, there is a set voltage
that this board can handle.

6
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.410
There's also, obviously the directions
that you get to choose on your GPIO,

7
00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:28.110
so in most cases by default your GPIOs

8
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.090
are set as inputs because that's when
they're allowed to take voltages in.

9
00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.430
Now, later on in course three we're
going to talk to you in a lot of detail

10
00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.280
about these GPIOs, and the expansion
headers you can see on the screen there.

11
00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.440
Like I said, in more detail, so

12
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.440
you'll have a lot better
idea as to how to use these.

13
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.670
And why it's important to pay
attention to the direction and

14
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:51.970
the values that set to them.

15
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.420
But when you're using this header,
you need to make sure that

16
00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.015
you are only using the GPIOs
that you know how to use.

17
00:01:02.015 --> 00:01:05.950
Yeah, there's lots of documentation,
we are going to talk about it.

18
00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.450
But if you start messing with GPIO values,

19
00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.450
you don't know what they're connected
to or how to manipulate them.

20
00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.651
You could end up messing
something upon your board.

21
00:01:15.651 --> 00:01:18.696
>> And I can speak for this from
experience, because I know when I first

22
00:01:18.696 --> 00:01:21.756
got my Dragonboard, we were trying
to figure out all the GPIO pins.

23
00:01:21.756 --> 00:01:26.470
I think there's about 400,
500 available via the virtual file system.

24
00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.810
And I was just going one by one,
just putting in and

25
00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.960
out, writing out, going high, going low.

26
00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.850
And actually there are a few pins in
there that are either are not supposed

27
00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.850
to be flipped or
actually is vital to the startup system.

28
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.819
So I know there's a pin in there where
whenever turn it into an output,

29
00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:49.603
it always causes a restart of the system,
or it causes it to crash.

30
00:01:49.603 --> 00:01:54.360
So make sure again as Robert said
look at the documentation only

31
00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.065
use the pins that are listed there.

32
00:01:57.065 --> 00:01:58.813
And if you are feeling daring and

33
00:01:58.813 --> 00:02:02.632
you actually want to run the risk of
ruining your board, then you can go

34
00:02:02.632 --> 00:02:06.930
ahead and play around with those GPIOs,
but we strongly discourage it.

35
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.940
>> It's also really important to notice
that, later on when we talk about this,

36
00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.530
you're gonna see that on
the expansion header you have the DC

37
00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.640
input accessible on one of the GPIOs.

38
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.570
And then right next to it, let's see 40,
39, so 38 and 37 you have access

39
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:28.100
to a DC input which could be anywhere
between 6.5 volts all the way to 18.

40
00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.250
And then right next to it
you have a 5 volt output.

41
00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.800
You also have grounds on all four
corners of the expansion there.

42
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:41.610
So if you accidentally touch pins to the
ground and to this 12.5 or 12 volt pin,

43
00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.580
you just shorted your board and a variety
of things could happen if you do that.

44
00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.690
>> Yeah
>> So yeah, be very careful.

45
00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.010
Make sure you read
the documentation like Ara said and

46
00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.900
watch our videos in the next course
to get more in tune with this.
