00:00:05.838 --> 00:00:06.941
Hey everyone.

2
00:00:06.941 --> 00:00:11.477
So we're at the final stage of the game
here and we're actually gonna show you how

3
00:00:11.477 --> 00:00:14.850
to fast boot flash everything
onto the dragon board.

4
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.120
So the first thing we're gonna do here
is actually go to the dragon board and

5
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.230
see if we have everything
set up correctly.

6
00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.060
So the first thing we wanna make sure as
soon as you get to the dragging board here

7
00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.000
is to make sure that there's no
power going into the dragging board.

8
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.850
So make sure there's nothing
plugged into the power jack.

9
00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.840
And then the next thing we wanna do
is turn the dragging board over and

10
00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.070
then you're gonna see
a couple dip switches.

11
00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.550
And these switches are what ensure that
the board boots up into fast boot,

12
00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.300
so you wanna make sure that all the
switches are on zero zero zero zero, so

13
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.860
right here we have the switches and

14
00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.070
they are all at zero zero zero zero so
that one's good to go, that's clear.

15
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.640
And then the third thing you wanna check
is make sure your micro USB is connected

16
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.000
to your host PC you have your HDMI plugged
in for your monitor, and then you have

17
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.570
this little dongle that plug in connects
with our keyboard and mouse there.

18
00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.020
And then now,
we're actually gonna boot into fast boot.

19
00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.530
So we kinda went over this
before in previous videos.

20
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.280
But we're just gonna touch on it again and
recap here.

21
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.540
So what we wanna do is
put our finger down and

22
00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.830
press down the minus button here, so
it's located next to the USB ports.

23
00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.220
So, press the minus button and
then plug in your power jack.

24
00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.100
And we found that the sweet spot for

25
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.440
keeping your finger on
the button is about ten seconds.

26
00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.410
So at the end of this sentence,
I'm just gonna lift my finger and

27
00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:34.940
the board should hopefully
be in fast boot mode.

28
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.370
And Robert here, is gonna actually check
on his computer if it's on fast boot mode.

29
00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.930
Yeah.
Perfect.

30
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.490
So let's go ahead and
take a look here at my computer.

31
00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.220
First off, we want to, let's use our path
variable that we made earlier right, so

32
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.630
to do that,
we're going to do a dollar sign fast boot,

33
00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.870
which is the variable that I chose
that basically executes my fast boot.

34
00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.080
Now, one of the fast boot
commands is devices So

35
00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.090
if I put fast food devices,
I should see the device there.

36
00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.910
And sure enough, there it is.

37
00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:11.840
You can see the little code that's linked
with our dragon board 410C right now.

38
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.090
Now that we have assured that
the board is in fact in fast boot and

39
00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:22.070
communicating with our host PC we
are going to go into the folder where we

40
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.260
have that script that we downloaded and
modified.

41
00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.660
>> With all the bootloaders and
everything [INAUDIBLE].

42
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.440
>> Yeah,
with everything that we have in there.

43
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.870
So let's go ahead and check that out.

44
00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.110
So the directory I'm in right now,
I'm gonna need to go into my desktop.

45
00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.030
So let's cd into the desktop.

46
00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.950
Then from there,

47
00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.960
if you remember from the previous videos,
I have everything in my android folder.

48
00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.750
So I'm gonna CD into my android folder.

49
00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.320
From my android folder I made it difficult
and I have one extra folder to get

50
00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:55.110
through, but now that I'm in there you can
see that my flashall file is right there.

51
00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:01.080
So to execute that in Mac,
you're just gonna ./flashall,

52
00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.510
and magically we're going to
start writing everything.

53
00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:06.960
>> Everything is now flashing on,

54
00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.080
everything about the operating system is
going to be flashed on to the dragonboard

55
00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.850
there
>> And

56
00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.500
hopefully by the end of all the flashing,
you're gonna have a fully

57
00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.250
functional operating system on your dragon
board, the android operating system.

58
00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.750
And you can do a lot of cool things
with it and if you had any problems with

59
00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.530
flashing it on there you can
always check our documents.

60
00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.180
Documentation, we have some
more information there, and

61
00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.330
hopefully we'll see you in our feature
videos and see what you can do with it.

62
00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:33.710
>> One last thing also.

63
00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:35.000
Once you've flashed everything over,

64
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.560
which does take a little bit, I mean,
I think less than flashing an SD card.

65
00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.480
But still takes a little bit to boot into

66
00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.250
your android system all you're going to
do is just, once everything is ready,

67
00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.740
unplug the power and then plug it back in
>> Yeah.

68
00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:51.580
>> Yeah. So. >> It should boot up straight
up into the operating system there.

69
00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.150
>> This is one of the safe times that
you're allowed to just unplug it without

70
00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.040
doing anything after you've flashed
everything for the first time.

71
00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.580
Besides that, yeah.

72
00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.420
>> Like he said, see you in future videos.

73
00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:04.290
>> See you in later videos.
