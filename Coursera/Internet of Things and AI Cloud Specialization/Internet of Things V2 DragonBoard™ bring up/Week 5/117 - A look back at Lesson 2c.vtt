Hey, everyone.

2
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:05.640
So now that we have our Android
operating system on our Dragonboard,

3
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.230
we're just gonna do a quick summary and

4
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.830
then look back on everything
we did in this set of videos.

5
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.700
So the first thing we did was go
to the 96boards.org website and

6
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.310
download all of the Android binaries and
bootloaders that we needed.

7
00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.490
>> Yeah, then we took you through a nice
way of kind of keeping it organized in

8
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.540
folders here on your Mac, and
how you would go about creating your path

9
00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:33.730
variable, modifying the little script
that's provided to you in the bootloader

10
00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.710
download that you got, along with
flashing everything onto your board.

11
00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.030
So we kinda went over things that you've
already seen before in previous lessons,

12
00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.730
booting your board into Fastboot,

13
00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.850
making sure that you have have
your toggle switches there or

14
00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.050
your dip switches set up properly, making
sure everything's plugged in properly.

15
00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.600
And then we finally ran the script

16
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.530
which pushed all of the images
over onto the board.

17
00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.560
>> Yup.

18
00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.220
>> So yeah, we'll see you again,
hopefully in later videos.

19
00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.840
We look forward to using this
operating system for lots of fun and

20
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.160
exciting things.

21
00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.542
Stay tuned for-
>> Better and bigger things.

22
00:01:10.542 --> 00:01:13.102
>> [LAUGH] Yeah, see you soon.
