00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.195
Throughout this lesson,
I think you've learned quite a few things.

2
00:00:06.195 --> 00:00:06.810
>> Yeah.

3
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.040
>> Most importantly, you should
have learned how to put the Android

4
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.330
operating system onto your DragonBoard
410C using the fast-boot operations,

5
00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.400
or fast-boot commands and
flashing it on that way.

6
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.390
We took you through the download
process on the 96boards.org website.

7
00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:23.770
We downloaded the boot loader,

8
00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.992
we downloaded all of the different
other little files that you needed.

9
00:00:26.992 --> 00:00:28.870
>> We needed the binaries
>> And yeah.

10
00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:32.190
>> And then the next thing we
did is create a path variable,

11
00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:34.930
like I said before it makes
our life a lot easier.

12
00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.602
And because we can refer to
the destination without having to traverse

13
00:00:37.602 --> 00:00:38.471
through each folder.

14
00:00:38.471 --> 00:00:40.258
And then a very important thing we did,

15
00:00:40.258 --> 00:00:43.680
a very useful thing is gonna be very
useful for anything else you want to do.

16
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.070
Is we modified a script file, and so
what the script file allowed us to do was,

17
00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.840
you download a bunch of files and instead
of having to fast boot each one separately

18
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.130
you were just able to append each
command onto the script file, and

19
00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.940
just run the script file, and
the script file will do everything for us.

20
00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.490
So, in the third video after that, what we
did was we actually flashed everything.

21
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.690
So we modified the script file some more.

22
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.000
And then we went to a command prompt,
and we executed the script file.

23
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.700
And boom, everything started
flashing on toward dragon board.

24
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.790
And we have the Android operating
system on our dragon board, now.

25
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.900
>> Yeah, it was very important to kind
of notice the difference between the,

26
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.110
using the SD card, which is several
other videos that we did in this module.

27
00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.420
>> Mm hm. Right.
>> And using the fastboot.

28
00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.315
So, some people might find
fast Fast boot faster,

29
00:01:31.315 --> 00:01:33.245
some people might find the SD card faster.

30
00:01:33.245 --> 00:01:35.395
I think personally I like
the fast boot a little more.

31
00:01:35.395 --> 00:01:36.845
>> And I personally like the SD card more.

32
00:01:36.845 --> 00:01:37.705
Yeah.

33
00:01:37.705 --> 00:01:38.395
>> Oh man.

34
00:01:38.395 --> 00:01:39.855
Alright, cool, so yeah.

35
00:01:39.855 --> 00:01:44.455
Anyways, we'll see you in later videos
where we teach you more operations, and

36
00:01:44.455 --> 00:01:47.425
how to use these operating
systems in a variety of ways.

37
00:01:47.425 --> 00:01:47.925
>> Yes.
