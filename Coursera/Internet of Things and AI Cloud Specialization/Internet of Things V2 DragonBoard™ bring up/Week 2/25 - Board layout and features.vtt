00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.870
Hello, everyone, and welcome to the first video of

2
00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.880
lesson one where we're going to talk about the DragonBoard 410c,

3
00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.586
its layout, and all of its features.

4
00:00:09.586 --> 00:00:10.680
So as you can see here,

5
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:16.680
we have a picture of the 96Boards Consumer Edition standard size footprint.

6
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.490
This specification is what is used or what was used to design the DragonBoard 410c.

7
00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.720
If you focus on the schematic and look at it closely,

8
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.008
you can see a variety of components that come standard on this footprint, such as,

9
00:00:30.008 --> 00:00:31.110
if you look at the bottom side,

10
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:32.985
you'll see some USB ports,

11
00:00:32.985 --> 00:00:35.715
maybe a micro USB port, HDMI,

12
00:00:35.715 --> 00:00:37.755
SD card slot, some headers,

13
00:00:37.755 --> 00:00:39.595
and then a lot of empty space.

14
00:00:39.595 --> 00:00:44.010
This allowed for the makers of the DragonBoard to throw on a variety of

15
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.660
components that accent their board using the 96Boards specification,

16
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.035
such as a bunch of these components we're going to look at right now.

17
00:00:52.035 --> 00:00:54.300
So in this slide, you can actually see

18
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.195
the components populated on the DragonBoard itself.

19
00:00:57.195 --> 00:00:58.575
They're all nicely numbered,

20
00:00:58.575 --> 00:01:01.050
take some time to read through all the components,

21
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.940
you can see the Snapdragon 410e chipset said on the DragonBoard.

22
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.830
That's basically the APQ8016,

23
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.850
as we call it, internally within Qualcomm.

24
00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.165
And one of the things we did at Qualcomm was identified

25
00:01:13.165 --> 00:01:16.775
that 410e chipset as extended life.

26
00:01:16.775 --> 00:01:20.560
So now, it's supported for 10 years for IoT devices, for the IoT segment.

27
00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.555
And you can see all the other components there,

28
00:01:22.555 --> 00:01:24.180
you can see the HDMI cables,

29
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.010
you can see the USB connectors, micro USB connectors,

30
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.720
you can see the Wi-Fi/GPS chipsets,

31
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.235
the antennas, the power connectors,

32
00:01:33.235 --> 00:01:35.070
low speed and high speed expansion headers,

33
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.930
of course, and SD card connectors.

34
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.100
Very interesting kind of tidbit on the DragonBoard 410c.

35
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.750
I've heard it referred to as,

36
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.960
kind of a Android phone without the screen, right?

37
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.625
And this is kind of what people talk about and something

38
00:01:47.625 --> 00:01:49.870
Rajon also didn't point out here yet,

39
00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.070
but there are some buttons there as well.

40
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.130
You have a volume low,

41
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.530
a volume high and a power button.

42
00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.285
These buttons, if you were running Android on your device,

43
00:01:57.285 --> 00:02:02.215
would basically serve as the Android buttons on your phone, which is kind of cool.

44
00:02:02.215 --> 00:02:06.855
Another cool thing about Qualcomm Snapdragon 410e chipset,

45
00:02:06.855 --> 00:02:09.735
like Rajon said, it is extended life 10 years.

46
00:02:09.735 --> 00:02:11.790
So for those of you who are going to be developing

47
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.840
long life cycle or long term development plans,

48
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.700
if you have some long term development plans,

49
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.290
this is a great chipset to choose.

50
00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.070
One of the other things we would like to point out is on the picture that you see,

51
00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.950
it's basically not shielded.

52
00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.838
You can see all the components which are exposed for the picture to make it pretty.

53
00:02:29.838 --> 00:02:32.445
But the actual board that you will have in your hands,

54
00:02:32.445 --> 00:02:36.200
the APQ8016 chipset which

55
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.125
is a sample like 410e chipset is actually shielded with a silver shield,

56
00:02:39.125 --> 00:02:43.055
so you won't actually be able to visibly see the chipset on it,

57
00:02:43.055 --> 00:02:44.780
but you can have the picture.

58
00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.820
And when we open our DragonBoards in the next video,

59
00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.010
you'll get to see what we're talking about.

60
00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.130
So here, another picture,

61
00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:53.955
this is the backside of the DragonBoard.

62
00:02:53.955 --> 00:02:57.010
We'd like to point out just the dip switches.

63
00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.130
Some interesting thing here as well,

64
00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.110
is that if you didn't notice on the other side,

65
00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.365
there isn't a heat sink.

66
00:03:02.365 --> 00:03:04.380
This little gold, kind

67
00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.240
of the square gold piece that is around the chips on the back there,

68
00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.415
that is actually a built in heat sink.

69
00:03:11.415 --> 00:03:16.155
So, very interesting choice there for the DragonBoard 410c.

70
00:03:16.155 --> 00:03:18.750
And later on, we'll go into the dip switches

71
00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.750
and different boot modes later on in the course.

72
00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.830
Here, we'd like to take some time to point out

73
00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.465
the different I/O capabilities that are built in to the 96Boards specification,

74
00:03:30.465 --> 00:03:32.295
which the DragonBoard follows.

75
00:03:32.295 --> 00:03:35.605
On the left side, you're going to see the low speed expansion header,

76
00:03:35.605 --> 00:03:37.590
which we will outline later in the course.

77
00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.300
And on the right side,

78
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.500
you're going to see the high speed expansion header.

79
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.480
This basically gives any developer,

80
00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.180
any person who chooses to use the DragonBoard 410c,

81
00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.055
a plethora of I/O,

82
00:03:49.055 --> 00:03:52.250
pretty much the sky's the limit when it comes

83
00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.485
to what you would like to interact within the environment.

84
00:03:55.485 --> 00:03:57.860
So, take a second, explore the headers,

85
00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.750
you have GPIO, I2Cs, SPIs.

86
00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.190
Of course, your voltage outputs and ground, you need those.

87
00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.210
And then on the high speed expansion header come a lot more complex I/O which we will

88
00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:13.235
touch on later when we talk about a variety of add-ons to the board.

89
00:04:13.235 --> 00:04:18.270
For fun, we included some of these colorful diagrams.

90
00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:22.489
So basically, what you were seeing in the last slide with the pin-outs,

91
00:04:22.489 --> 00:04:24.225
this is a fun version of the pin-outs.

92
00:04:24.225 --> 00:04:27.390
These are available for you on the 96Boards DragonBoard

93
00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:31.560
landing page and you can see more if you visit the URL that's available on the slide.

94
00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.813
Yes. And we'll talk about this a little bit more in detail as we go down the course.

95
00:04:36.813 --> 00:04:40.010
But essentially, based on the operating system you use,

96
00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.500
you might use different pin numbers for using those GPIOs,

97
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.440
and the slide that you have right here kind of

98
00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.585
shows that one is for Android and one is for Debian.

99
00:04:49.585 --> 00:04:54.780
And you will be using different pin numbers just to code and use your GPIOs.

100
00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.603
Great.

101
00:04:56.603 --> 00:04:59.505
So, I think it's time that we pause the video,

102
00:04:59.505 --> 00:05:02.925
reflect a minute on what was discussed around the DragonBoard.

103
00:05:02.925 --> 00:05:04.485
Maybe if you want to rewind,

104
00:05:04.485 --> 00:05:06.660
explore a little bit about what we talked about,

105
00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.205
with regard to the components,

106
00:05:08.205 --> 00:05:12.285
the 96Boards specification which is available on the 96Boards.org website,

107
00:05:12.285 --> 00:05:17.883
or simply poke around some extracurricular documentation around the DragonBoard,

108
00:05:17.883 --> 00:05:20.250
you can visit any of these URLs up here.

109
00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:24.345
In the next video, we're going to be unboxing these DragonBoards

110
00:05:24.345 --> 00:05:26.310
and talking a little bit more in-depth about

111
00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:29.000
the components that we just listed out on the slides.
