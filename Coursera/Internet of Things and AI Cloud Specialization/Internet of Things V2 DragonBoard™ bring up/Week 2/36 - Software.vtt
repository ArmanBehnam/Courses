00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420
In this video, I'm going to give you

2
00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:07.095
a quick overview of the software that you can load onto the DragonBoard.

3
00:00:07.095 --> 00:00:11.480
The DragonBoard runs many different operating systems.

4
00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.865
So it's not limited to just one like many other single board computers.

5
00:00:16.865 --> 00:00:19.880
The major choices are Android,

6
00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.610
Debian, and Windows 10.

7
00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.945
Android is really useful for running applications

8
00:00:26.945 --> 00:00:31.335
and one of the most common questions I hear is,

9
00:00:31.335 --> 00:00:34.415
which operating system should I run on my DragonBoard?

10
00:00:34.415 --> 00:00:37.955
Well it really depends on what kind of developer you are.

11
00:00:37.955 --> 00:00:39.935
If you are an Android developer,

12
00:00:39.935 --> 00:00:43.325
building applications for Android phones then,

13
00:00:43.325 --> 00:00:44.780
you should run Android and then,

14
00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.960
you can use all of your knowledge of Android and Android

15
00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.845
apps to build apps that run on the DragonBoard.

16
00:00:52.845 --> 00:00:57.520
If you are a Windows 10 developer and you're used to using

17
00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.400
the Microsoft tools then you should put Windows 10 on the board.

18
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.180
This is a stripped down version of the full Windows 10,

19
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.385
but it is large enough that universal apps created using the Microsoft studio,

20
00:01:12.385 --> 00:01:18.680
all run on this board just as if they were running on your desktop system.

21
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.630
Finally, there's the Debian system,

22
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.685
which is a Linux system with a desktop and a console and it's very easy to use.

23
00:01:27.685 --> 00:01:31.050
And if you're a Linux developer this is probably the choice for

24
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.350
you and will be used through most of this course, the remaining sections.

25
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.190
If you're developing a final product,

26
00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.598
if you're taking it from the DragonBoard,

27
00:01:41.598 --> 00:01:45.640
from the learning tool to creating your own custom boards and

28
00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.935
your own custom plastics and selling a product that does some interesting thing,

29
00:01:50.935 --> 00:01:54.820
you probably don't want to put Android on the board.

30
00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.815
Android doesn't have a long life span,

31
00:01:57.815 --> 00:02:01.255
they keep revising it, generation to generation.

32
00:02:01.255 --> 00:02:03.010
Almost every year there's a new version of

33
00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.420
Android and if you expect to sell your product for a long time,

34
00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.000
having Android on the board will be a lot of support work.

35
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.520
The other operating systems,

36
00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.300
Debian and Windows 10 or Linux and Windows 10,

37
00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.945
have much longer lifespans.

38
00:02:17.945 --> 00:02:23.275
You can expect your product to run for years on those versions.

39
00:02:23.275 --> 00:02:25.195
In the Linux world,

40
00:02:25.195 --> 00:02:28.735
there are many different distributions.

41
00:02:28.735 --> 00:02:33.835
So we have the Linaro open embedded distribution, there's Ubuntu Core,

42
00:02:33.835 --> 00:02:37.210
there's Fedora, there's SUSE and all of

43
00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.375
these distributions run quite well on the DragonBoard.

44
00:02:41.375 --> 00:02:45.735
In fact, we have more distributions coming.

45
00:02:45.735 --> 00:02:47.800
So by the time you see this video,

46
00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.840
there may be more than just the ones I've listed so far.

47
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.974
So you have to make a choice,

48
00:02:53.974 --> 00:02:55.410
which one do you want to use?

49
00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.555
And the choice should be what are you familiar with,

50
00:02:58.555 --> 00:03:01.335
and if you're building a long term product or not.

51
00:03:01.335 --> 00:03:02.450
If you're just learning,

52
00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.155
then Android might be a very good choice for you or Windows 10.

53
00:03:06.155 --> 00:03:09.750
If you're building your next great thing

54
00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.690
it's probably best to use Linux distribution or a Windows 10 distribution.

55
00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.680
Hopefully this is giving you a quick overview of all the things you can

56
00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.925
do or all the software you can run on the DragonBoard.

57
00:03:22.925 --> 00:03:25.800
And we have a number of resources.

58
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.250
We have the Qualcomm Developer Network

59
00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.430
which gives you pointers to some of these operating systems.

60
00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.400
We have the 96Boards website which has

61
00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:41.145
the Consumer Edition Products page the DragonBoard 410 landing page.

62
00:03:41.145 --> 00:03:44.615
Arrow Electronics has a lot of software

63
00:03:44.615 --> 00:03:49.070
and you can buy DragonBoards directly from Arrow Electronics.

64
00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:52.325
You can also buy DragonBoards from Amazon.com.

65
00:03:52.325 --> 00:03:57.680
Hopefully, all of these ideas and the openness of

66
00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:03.710
the software will inspire you to build new products using the DragonBoard 410c.
