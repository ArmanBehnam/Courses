00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.320
So we just wanna take a quick look back at
what we've talked about in this lesson.

2
00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.280
First off, we showed you guys the boot
loader where you see all the dip

3
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.140
switches located on the bottom of the
board underneath the micro SD card slot.

4
00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:16.650
We also mentioned how there's mutual
exclusivity between the micro USB and

5
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:17.650
the other USB ports.

6
00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.740
We've also talked about booting
up the board for the first time.

7
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.190
>> On multiple operating systems.

8
00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:29.730
>> Yeah, whether you use an Android or
Ubuntu or flashing in between.

9
00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.650
>> We taught you how to
get your development

10
00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:37.750
options set up by basically
enabling your USB debugging.

11
00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.550
So that's a very important
thing that you should know.

12
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.435
We definitely looked over
how to test a variety of

13
00:00:45.435 --> 00:00:48.942
the components just in a very superficial,

14
00:00:48.942 --> 00:00:54.941
simple way by basically accessing
the Internet and doing stuff like that.

15
00:00:54.941 --> 00:00:59.681
And then we kind of went over a few
things, and gave you some tips on how to

16
00:00:59.681 --> 00:01:04.600
take care of your board to make it
last as long as possible, so yeah.

17
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.380
>> Yeah, I know it's pretty and
shiny but don't pump that in it.
