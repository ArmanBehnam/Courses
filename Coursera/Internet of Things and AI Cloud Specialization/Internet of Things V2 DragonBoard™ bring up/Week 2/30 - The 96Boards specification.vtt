00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.550
In this lesson, I'm here to talk to you about the 96Boards Specification,

2
00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:08.425
where the specification came from,

3
00:00:08.425 --> 00:00:10.595
and why we created it.

4
00:00:10.595 --> 00:00:13.705
So, the 96Boards group,

5
00:00:13.705 --> 00:00:21.345
we realized that there wasn't a specification for a board that was specific for ARM SoCs.

6
00:00:21.345 --> 00:00:28.270
There were many other board specifications for PCs built on Intel chips for boards like

7
00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.150
the Pi or the Beagle board that were built on

8
00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.030
specific chips and those boards all brought

9
00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.595
out just the connections that were specific to that chip.

10
00:00:37.595 --> 00:00:39.040
Every time you have a new chip,

11
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.650
you get a new specification,

12
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.925
a different physical form factor board.

13
00:00:42.925 --> 00:00:44.290
We wanted a single,

14
00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:51.010
physical form factor that brought out the same signals for every ARM SoC.

15
00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.680
The one thing we knew we had in common is

16
00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.220
most ARM SoCs were originally developed for cell phones.

17
00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.740
So, we have all of the cell phone common interfaces.

18
00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:05.280
And that's what we brought to the surface of the 96Boards Spec.

19
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.100
The second thing we wanted in the specification was a small size,

20
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.870
the size of a credit card.

21
00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.726
By making it small,

22
00:01:12.726 --> 00:01:15.235
we knew that we would keep the cost down,

23
00:01:15.235 --> 00:01:16.975
make it easy to produce,

24
00:01:16.975 --> 00:01:19.930
and make it easy to put into systems,

25
00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.620
to use as a building block for building larger things.

26
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.490
So, those were the real reason behind why we want to do the Specs.

27
00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.710
Then we got into some of the details and the first thing we recognized is,

28
00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.744
with this very small form factor,

29
00:01:38.744 --> 00:01:40.420
it was impossible to put something like

30
00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.790
a large ethernet connector if you wanted wired ethernet.

31
00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.020
So we built a second version of the Specification which we call

32
00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:53.785
the extended 96Boards CE Specification and we'll get into the details of those.

33
00:01:53.785 --> 00:01:58.105
But the basic footprint of the high speed and low speed connector,

34
00:01:58.105 --> 00:02:00.110
which we'll get into later,

35
00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.250
is common across all of

36
00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.410
the 96Board Specifications and allows you to build mezzanine cards that

37
00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.365
will inter-operate with SoCs from

38
00:02:11.365 --> 00:02:17.235
multiple vendors and different speeds and powers of CPU.

39
00:02:17.235 --> 00:02:19.815
So, this gave us a great building block.

40
00:02:19.815 --> 00:02:22.540
So, some of the unique features we realized.

41
00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.160
We had looked at the Raspberry Pi as a example and one of

42
00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.785
the things we noticed was people had so much problem with power to the Raspberry Pi.

43
00:02:31.785 --> 00:02:36.043
If you didn't have exactly the right power supply, the board crashed.

44
00:02:36.043 --> 00:02:40.410
And that is still an issue with Raspberry Pis.

45
00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.255
We wrote the Specifications so that we would accept a wide range of power.

46
00:02:44.255 --> 00:02:48.223
In this case, we accept anything between eight and 18 volts,

47
00:02:48.223 --> 00:02:51.295
which means you can run it from battery packs,

48
00:02:51.295 --> 00:02:58.570
12-volt car systems, and any 12-volt supply, 14.4-volt battery packs.

49
00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.410
And all you need to do is give the board power and it will clean it up

50
00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.225
and create the clean power that's necessary to run a board like this.

51
00:03:07.225 --> 00:03:10.965
So that was one of the unique features of the Specification.

52
00:03:10.965 --> 00:03:15.610
A few other things we did is we brought it two USBs.

53
00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.210
We didn't stack them one on top of the other because we wanted

54
00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:24.130
the board to be very thin to allow very compact systems.

55
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.800
So there's only seven millimeters above the board

56
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.725
and three millimeters below the board of space,

57
00:03:29.725 --> 00:03:32.070
giving you a really compact system,

58
00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.120
size for credit card.

59
00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.090
But, of course, if you need to add more features,

60
00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.860
you can stack mezzanine boards.

61
00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.650
Other things we did is we started developing the 410c board and

62
00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:52.020
the 410c board was intended to bring out the features of the Qualcomm board.

63
00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.320
So, we started looking at it.

64
00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.282
And one of the problems we realized is you have thermal issues.

65
00:03:58.282 --> 00:04:01.865
You need to get rid of the power from the SoC out to

66
00:04:01.865 --> 00:04:06.655
a heat sink or some external element if you're running the SoC at full speed.

67
00:04:06.655 --> 00:04:11.680
You'll notice that the DragonBoard has a rectangular area

68
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:17.370
here that is thermally conductive up to the SoC.

69
00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.410
Now, every system that you've worked on in the past always had

70
00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.690
the SoC and the heat sink on the top of the board.

71
00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:31.255
And in this case, the SoC is on the top but the heat sink goes on the bottom.

72
00:04:31.255 --> 00:04:35.150
When you're using very high powered CPUs such as

73
00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.875
the Intel processors that dissipate 125 Watts,

74
00:04:39.875 --> 00:04:46.180
you need a large heat sink and east have very good contact with the dye,

75
00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.650
the silicon dye inside the chip.

76
00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.190
In this case, we're using much lower power CPUs,

77
00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.190
typically in the three or four watt region.

78
00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:59.920
And it's sufficient for the heat to flow down through all of the balls in the package

79
00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:05.795
and out through the plains of the copper on the board and through that pad on the bottom.

80
00:05:05.795 --> 00:05:09.680
So, we can use a very different heat sink design.

81
00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:14.045
Other features that we brought in on here is we recognize that

82
00:05:14.045 --> 00:05:18.740
connectivity is incredibly important in every system,

83
00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.310
so we added Bluetooth and Wi-Fi antennas.

84
00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:25.785
And this area is reserved in the 96Board Spec for

85
00:05:25.785 --> 00:05:30.680
antennas because every system will have connectivity.

86
00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.020
And the world is wireless now,

87
00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:38.085
so you'll see that there are no wired connections.

88
00:05:38.085 --> 00:05:43.900
We've also brought out HDMI port so that you can connect to any standard HDMI monitor.

89
00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.560
And that makes it easy to connect.

90
00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.010
This port is identical to the port on

91
00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:53.090
your cell phone that you normally connect your charging to.

92
00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:59.150
So it is a USB slave port and these are two USB master ports.

93
00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.310
So all of these things together combine in

94
00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:06.035
one very small neat package gives you the DragonBoard.

95
00:06:06.035 --> 00:06:08.900
At the end of this lesson, we'll give you a set of resources you

96
00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.460
can actually go and read the 96Board Specification.

97
00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:16.215
And so, there is the Specification on the 96Boards website.

98
00:06:16.215 --> 00:06:21.140
There's also a 96Boards GitHub which has the Specification.

99
00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:25.000
Hopefully, this will give you an introduction to the board and what you can do with it.
