00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:01.701
Congratulations everyone,

2
00:00:01.701 --> 00:00:05.570
you've officially made it to
the homework section of lesson three.

3
00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:10.075
I don't know how much of a congratulations
that is, but yeah, we're here and

4
00:00:10.075 --> 00:00:14.049
we're ready to kind of tell what you
need to do to get past this lesson.

5
00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:16.820
First off, most of this is
going to be just exploring.

6
00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.317
We want to make sure you take the time to
really let it sink in, all the things that

7
00:00:21.317 --> 00:00:25.524
you've got to see throughout this course.
>> So?

8
00:00:25.524 --> 00:00:27.086
>> Yeah, explore the 96Boards

9
00:00:27.086 --> 00:00:28.380
Mezzanine page.

10
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.230
Go to the products page, go click around
the mezzanines, find out the resources.

11
00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.320
See which ones have schematics,
which ones don't.

12
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.000
Maybe you want to complain and
let us know which ones don't, so

13
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.980
that we can start poking
people to get them.

14
00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.520
Read through the Mezzanine guidelines.

15
00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.260
It's a quick PDF,
it's a very interesting read.

16
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.020
Suggest you all doing that,
visit the mezzanine-community repository.

17
00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.285
Now this is something you're
actually going to have to do.

18
00:00:50.285 --> 00:00:53.572
We want you to propose a Mezzanine or

19
00:00:53.572 --> 00:00:58.620
contribute to a current
thread on the issues section.

20
00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.300
I'm not sure how we're going to be able
to enforce this, but we highly suggest or

21
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.660
highly recommend you do this.

22
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.610
So please visit that repository,
go click on the issues,

23
00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.780
and just kind of poke around there.
>> Yeah,

24
00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.770
take a look at the Qualcomm
Developer Network resources as well.

25
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.320
Take a look at the Snapdragon
410E app notes.

26
00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.258
There's a whole bunch of app notes
there that tell you how to do

27
00:01:21.258 --> 00:01:25.560
a whole bunch of stuff on the Snapdragon
410E and the DragonBoard 410c.

28
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.830
So take a look at those resources,
go play around,

29
00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.500
go poke around some resources.
>> And finally,

30
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.630
you will find a bunch of assessments
either throughout the course or

31
00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.450
at the end of this, throughout the lesson
and at the end of this lesson.

32
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.450
Please take the time to complete those.

33
00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.030
Any suggested reading that you'll find,

34
00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.060
please take the time to
read through those as well.

35
00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.780
And we look forward to seeing
you in the next module.
