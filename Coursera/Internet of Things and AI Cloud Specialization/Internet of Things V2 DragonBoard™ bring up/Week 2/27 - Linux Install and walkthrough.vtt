00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.698
Hi, in this session,

2
00:00:01.698 --> 00:00:05.480
we're going to walk you through Linux installation on the DragonBoard 410c,

3
00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.550
but also we'll be talking a little bit about what the different flavors

4
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.795
of operating systems are available for the DragonBoard 410c.

5
00:00:12.795 --> 00:00:16.519
So, in terms of your application development for developers,

6
00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:18.930
there's a lot of different options available to

7
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.740
you depending on the type of the vertical you are targeting.

8
00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.350
So the DroganBoard supports pure Android.

9
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.485
It supports Debian based desktop operating system,

10
00:00:28.485 --> 00:00:30.225
which is more of a desktop environment.

11
00:00:30.225 --> 00:00:33.496
So if somebody is starting off with the Dragonboard,

12
00:00:33.496 --> 00:00:35.440
that's a good platform to start off with.

13
00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.280
Then again, it also supports different flavors of Linux like OpenEmbedded,

14
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.925
Open Duo Core, Fedora,

15
00:00:41.925 --> 00:00:43.560
and more to come.

16
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.714
So, all of these different flavors provide the developers with different options.

17
00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:52.125
For example, Ubuntu Core has this snappy concept

18
00:00:52.125 --> 00:00:58.135
where it does a lot of deployment enablement for developers.

19
00:00:58.135 --> 00:01:01.020
So they don't have to worry about how to update

20
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.950
their applications out in the field and so forth and so on.

21
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:08.530
So it also supports Windows 10 IoT Core.

22
00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.560
So a lot of different flavors are available for

23
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.865
developers to start talking on the DragonBoard.

24
00:01:13.865 --> 00:01:17.760
And I want to add that you can always go find out more about

25
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.700
these different operating systems and see what people

26
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.060
are up to by visiting the DragonBoard 410c page.

27
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.380
And on that page,

28
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.980
you will find all these different operating system options,

29
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.695
to either download, find out how to build them,

30
00:01:31.695 --> 00:01:33.600
they'll take it to different websites that are

31
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.660
available to you like the Windows 10 IoT core,

32
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.820
96Boards, people at Qualcomm.

33
00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.625
They don't necessarily make this,

34
00:01:41.625 --> 00:01:45.270
but Microsoft took it upon themselves to develop

35
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.160
an operating system for the DragonBoard because

36
00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.455
they thought it was such a viable platform to use.

37
00:01:49.455 --> 00:01:52.175
So you can go visit the Windows 10 website,

38
00:01:52.175 --> 00:01:54.210
you can get access to their different images and

39
00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.995
flashes on your DragonBoard if that's what you feel like doing.

40
00:01:56.995 --> 00:01:59.445
Now, if you get stuck at any of these times,

41
00:01:59.445 --> 00:02:02.510
you can always go visit the 96Boards forums page.

42
00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.310
Many people have probably had the same questions you have had.

43
00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.700
So, please take that upon yourself to branch out and

44
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.132
explore the different resources you have around these operating systems.

45
00:02:13.132 --> 00:02:14.770
Great.

46
00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.130
Now that you know all these different operating systems that are available to you,

47
00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.475
we're going to single out one of them,

48
00:02:21.475 --> 00:02:24.520
and that is the Linaro Debian Build that is

49
00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.715
available to you through the 96Boards website,

50
00:02:27.715 --> 00:02:31.370
again on the DragonBoard 410c landing page there.

51
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:32.770
So, as we look at this,

52
00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.340
I want to first kind of go over an overview as to what we're going to cover,

53
00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.628
then we'll dive into a screencast,

54
00:02:38.628 --> 00:02:42.162
and we'll talk about what we'll actually go explore the website.

55
00:02:42.162 --> 00:02:44.285
So, first off, what are we going to do?

56
00:02:44.285 --> 00:02:46.480
We're going to visit the 96Boards.org website.

57
00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.275
Why? Well, because this is where the DragonBoard 410c landing page is.

58
00:02:50.275 --> 00:02:53.475
Then, we're going to look for that landing page,

59
00:02:53.475 --> 00:02:55.150
click on it, navigate to it,

60
00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.830
and you're going to basically follow this pattern,

61
00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.065
96Boards, go to the Products,

62
00:02:59.065 --> 00:03:01.700
go to the Consumer Editions section of the products,

63
00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.385
there you will find your DragonBoard 410c.

64
00:03:05.385 --> 00:03:08.530
Now, depending on what kit you got,

65
00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.015
and we already talked about this,

66
00:03:10.015 --> 00:03:13.435
you're going to be booting up into an Android image or a Debian image.

67
00:03:13.435 --> 00:03:15.910
Regardless of the image you boot up into,

68
00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.450
we want to make sure you have the most recent images on your board.

69
00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:25.265
So, we would still suggest you go and check out the new operating systems.

70
00:03:25.265 --> 00:03:27.315
We are going to click on the Debian one.

71
00:03:27.315 --> 00:03:29.650
So, once we click on the Debian image,

72
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.260
we'll download it and we'll choose an install method.

73
00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.035
Now, it might be slightly out of order here.

74
00:03:34.035 --> 00:03:35.370
But yes, there you go.

75
00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:36.730
So, download the image,

76
00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.215
choose your install method.

77
00:03:38.215 --> 00:03:41.560
For those of you who might be more experienced or

78
00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.155
feel like kind of flashing different types of images on there,

79
00:03:45.155 --> 00:03:50.270
you have the option to either go through an SD card option,

80
00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:52.638
you can either boot from the SD card,

81
00:03:52.638 --> 00:03:57.735
you can flash the image onto the local flash space,

82
00:03:57.735 --> 00:03:59.680
which is the eMMC on the DragonBoard,

83
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.945
or you can use fastboot to flash onto the local eMMC space.

84
00:04:04.945 --> 00:04:08.370
So there's different options of using an SD card or using fastboot.

85
00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.775
That's where the choose your installation method comes from.

86
00:04:12.775 --> 00:04:15.040
After that, you'll go to your host machine

87
00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.980
depending on whether or not you're using Mac, Linux, Windows,

88
00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.275
we have all the different instructions available to you,

89
00:04:20.275 --> 00:04:25.440
and you will follow those instructions. Rajan, are you ready?

90
00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.620
Yep.

91
00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.050
Okay. So now that we've just kind of gone over the overview,

92
00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:30.640
this is what we're basically going to do.

93
00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:37.651
Now let's dive in to the screencast and check out what we were trying to explain here.

94
00:04:37.651 --> 00:04:39.755
So, here we are on the screencast.

95
00:04:39.755 --> 00:04:44.660
You can see I am on the 96Boards.org website.

96
00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.020
If the letter is too small,

97
00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.213
I hope you can see that, but just go to www.96Boards.org.

98
00:04:50.213 --> 00:04:54.455
And this is the landing page you end up on.

99
00:04:54.455 --> 00:04:55.977
So, as I said,

100
00:04:55.977 --> 00:04:59.695
you're going to go to Products, Consumer Edition.

101
00:04:59.695 --> 00:05:05.035
Now, please forgive us if some of this is wrong by the time you're watching this video,

102
00:05:05.035 --> 00:05:06.305
but the idea is the same,

103
00:05:06.305 --> 00:05:08.500
navigate to the DragonBoard 410c.

104
00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.700
Here we go.

105
00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:12.910
What a beautiful page?

106
00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:15.700
You have a description of the DragonBoard.

107
00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:18.210
You have a couple of images over here,

108
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.700
they're showing you the front and back just to make sure you're in the right place.

109
00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:21.960
And you might notice also here,

110
00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.530
the image doesn't have the shield on it.

111
00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:25.750
So you get a nice view of that.

112
00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:26.935
We're not going to click on this,

113
00:05:26.935 --> 00:05:31.230
but you have a nice slow Getting Started guide in case you want documentation tutorials,

114
00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:33.510
and the support will take you directly to

115
00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:39.050
the 96Boards forums page that is dedicated to the DragonBoard 410c.

116
00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:42.080
Great. Scrolling down. As I mentioned,

117
00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.785
you could have one of these different kits here.

118
00:05:43.785 --> 00:05:45.630
So here's four different kits.

119
00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:49.510
But I'm assuming you're going to change the operating system anyways.

120
00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:54.590
We are going to be working with the Debian operating system.

121
00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:56.735
So let's click on Debian.

122
00:05:56.735 --> 00:06:00.415
Now, do remember when I mentioned how we had different options?

123
00:06:00.415 --> 00:06:03.375
Well, first let's read a second.

124
00:06:03.375 --> 00:06:05.663
Go ahead and take a second and read about Debian.

125
00:06:05.663 --> 00:06:08.390
I'm not going to stop here,

126
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:11.390
just pause and you can read about Debian or go to the website yourself.

127
00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:13.820
Then, the different options that we have.

128
00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:15.740
So, first, SD card image.

129
00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:19.710
Now, one is, as I said,

130
00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:23.723
SD card, image install and boot from eMMC.

131
00:06:23.723 --> 00:06:28.465
This is where you install your image onto an SD card,

132
00:06:28.465 --> 00:06:30.530
then you put it in your DragonBoard,

133
00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:36.053
and it flashes all of the information onto your local storage.

134
00:06:36.053 --> 00:06:40.715
The next option is flashing an SD card.

135
00:06:40.715 --> 00:06:44.720
But then instead of taking that image and flashing it onto your local storage,

136
00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.915
you are literally booting from your SD card.

137
00:06:47.915 --> 00:06:50.930
There are advantages to both of these methods.

138
00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:54.740
Now, one, the booting from your eMMC will

139
00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:58.955
increase your performance because you're running off the local storage.

140
00:06:58.955 --> 00:07:01.018
If you're booting from the SD card,

141
00:07:01.018 --> 00:07:03.253
you will reach certain bottlenecks.

142
00:07:03.253 --> 00:07:05.000
For most things, you won't notice.

143
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.100
However, depending on what you're doing,

144
00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:08.570
this might be a limitation for you.

145
00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:11.195
So, explore those options and read about it.

146
00:07:11.195 --> 00:07:13.585
Now, as we mentioned,

147
00:07:13.585 --> 00:07:15.850
you'll download or download.

148
00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:19.750
For those of you who would like to explore fastboot options,

149
00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:22.310
you can then download the bootloader, the boot image,

150
00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:24.310
and then you can choose whether or not you want to have

151
00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:26.870
a desktop image or developer image.

152
00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:29.485
I would suggest reading more into this.

153
00:07:29.485 --> 00:07:33.430
You can go explore these options or check out the forums and find out more.

154
00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:36.250
So let's just assume we choose the SD card image,

155
00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:39.608
and we want a boot on or flash onto the eMMC.

156
00:07:39.608 --> 00:07:41.860
So, download.

157
00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:44.265
I have my download going right here.

158
00:07:44.265 --> 00:07:46.300
Now, we're not going to wait for this to download.

159
00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:49.880
I'm just going to point out where to go after this.

160
00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:51.510
Now that we've downloaded our image,

161
00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:55.382
we want to find out how to install it.

162
00:07:55.382 --> 00:07:57.590
Installation, there.

163
00:07:57.590 --> 00:08:01.347
So it jumps us right to our documentation set for the DragonBoard 410c,

164
00:08:01.347 --> 00:08:02.450
and as you can see,

165
00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:05.630
it explains a little bit about installation,

166
00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:07.935
and then dives into the different methods.

167
00:08:07.935 --> 00:08:10.280
And as I was explaining earlier,

168
00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:12.410
you can read about these methods on your own.

169
00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:14.600
Installing, booting from eMMC,

170
00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:20.465
this might be your method or booting onto SD card and then again, fastboot method.

171
00:08:20.465 --> 00:08:26.085
Right here, since we chose to boot onto the eMMC or boot from eMMC,

172
00:08:26.085 --> 00:08:31.160
we will pick our host machine under this installation method.

173
00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.628
Now, had you chose to boot from SD card,

174
00:08:33.628 --> 00:08:37.670
you could once again go down here and pick your Linux.

175
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:42.260
Now, we do hopefully plan to release more methods or more installation methods later.

176
00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:47.231
But for now, there's a Linux method for installing on and booting from your SD card.

177
00:08:47.231 --> 00:08:49.498
So I'm running a Mac. I know.

178
00:08:49.498 --> 00:08:51.915
For me, I click Mac.

179
00:08:51.915 --> 00:08:57.068
And then, here you have all of the instructions that you need to follow.

180
00:08:57.068 --> 00:08:58.785
So we're not going to go through this

181
00:08:58.785 --> 00:09:01.440
because I think that this is a good learning opportunity for

182
00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:06.705
those of you watching to go through these instructions and do them yourself.

183
00:09:06.705 --> 00:09:12.990
A wonderful thing that we have offered on the 96Boards website is

184
00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:16.030
your ability to interact with everyone who's

185
00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:20.045
involved with this backend and frontend website.

186
00:09:20.045 --> 00:09:23.790
So if you come across a mistake or an error on any of

187
00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:28.400
our instruction sets or just something that you think is just plain confusing,

188
00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:30.165
you can come down to the bottom,

189
00:09:30.165 --> 00:09:33.720
and you can click the Edit Me on GitHub option.

190
00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:38.250
This should be available to you on every page on the 96Boards website.

191
00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:41.070
It will bring you right to our backend version of

192
00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:45.428
the 96Boards instruction set, any instruction set,

193
00:09:45.428 --> 00:09:48.045
and you can open an issue,

194
00:09:48.045 --> 00:09:50.250
you can edit it yourself,

195
00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:51.515
you can fork it,

196
00:09:51.515 --> 00:09:55.770
you can do basically anything that you could do on any other Git version control system.

197
00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:59.700
So, a very nice feature that hopefully will

198
00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:03.000
compliment your experience and

199
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.715
your ability to interact with those who are writing these instructions.

200
00:10:06.715 --> 00:10:12.980
Now, again, this is a community effort. So we want your input.

201
00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:16.735
If you find something that you are confused about please, let us know,

202
00:10:16.735 --> 00:10:19.590
open an issue, submit a pull request, fork it,

203
00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:22.915
submit a pull request, let us know how you feel about these instructions.

204
00:10:22.915 --> 00:10:24.308
They are ever changing,

205
00:10:24.308 --> 00:10:26.760
and that's the beauty of dynamic documentation.

206
00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:29.465
So there you go. Edit On GitHub,

207
00:10:29.465 --> 00:10:33.368
all of our documentation can be edited on GitHub.

208
00:10:33.368 --> 00:10:39.330
And I would like to mention that even though we've selected Debian only for this section,

209
00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:44.685
I'd imagine installing any operating system on the DragonBoard is along the same lines

210
00:10:44.685 --> 00:10:47.220
and there's pretty much code instructions available

211
00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:50.460
on the 96Boards website for you to follow.

212
00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:54.435
Yeah. So I think what Rajan just said,

213
00:10:54.435 --> 00:10:57.245
we can walk through some of these things.

214
00:10:57.245 --> 00:10:59.380
Here we have, again,

215
00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:02.949
the landing page on 96Boards.org.

216
00:11:02.949 --> 00:11:04.995
For those of you who are interested,

217
00:11:04.995 --> 00:11:10.675
you can explore all of our documentation right from the initial landing page.

218
00:11:10.675 --> 00:11:12.975
So, by clicking all the documentation,

219
00:11:12.975 --> 00:11:16.298
you can visit everything that has to do with 96Boards,

220
00:11:16.298 --> 00:11:17.745
you can report bugs,

221
00:11:17.745 --> 00:11:22.650
your contribution policy or specifications, and most importantly,

222
00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:26.025
go to the DragonBoard 410c documentation set,

223
00:11:26.025 --> 00:11:29.520
which is also available to you from the products page.

224
00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:33.380
So you remember how we were over here on the products page?

225
00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:38.855
It's completely the same as if you visit the documentation set.

226
00:11:38.855 --> 00:11:40.970
You can learn how to build from source,

227
00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:44.930
downloads, installation, the different downloads here that are available to you.

228
00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:47.859
Again, we have Debian, OpenEmbedded, Android, Ubuntu Core,

229
00:11:47.859 --> 00:11:51.515
Windows IoT Core, Fedora, and SUSE.

230
00:11:51.515 --> 00:11:52.718
They're on their way up to the website.

231
00:11:52.718 --> 00:11:56.280
There's a lot of really cool stuff going around the DragonBoard 410c.

232
00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:58.900
So I think it's time to recap. What do you think?

233
00:11:58.900 --> 00:11:59.620
Yeah.

234
00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:01.206
Okay.

235
00:12:01.206 --> 00:12:04.030
So, as a recap here,

236
00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:07.000
we want to give you the chance to pause,

237
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.505
reflect, and check out all these different links.

238
00:12:10.505 --> 00:12:12.215
I highly suggest taking,

239
00:12:12.215 --> 00:12:14.870
I mean, but 10 minutes is probably not enough.

240
00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:15.110
Yeah.

241
00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:21.070
Take some time, go poke through all these URLs and get to

242
00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:28.160
know the DragonBoard 410c and your resources around the different operating systems.
