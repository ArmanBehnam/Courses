00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:03.120
If you don't already
have your DragonBoard,

2
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.670
we'd like to kinda walk you through
the process of acquiring it.

3
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.840
All right, so, first step.

4
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.140
Go to the 96 Boards website.

5
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.550
There are several other ways, of course,
to find a way to purchase this.

6
00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.030
Just simply searching it on Google,
DragonBoard 410C, but

7
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.910
this is one of the easiest
ways that we found.

8
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.170
>> It's still relatively new, so.

9
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.540
>> Yeah.
>> This is probably the place

10
00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:24.490
you'll wanna go to get it.

11
00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:26.181
>> Yeah so go to the DragonBoards,
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:26.181 --> 00:00:33.562
Go the 96boards.org website, you're going
to click the DragonBoard 410c picture.

13
00:00:33.562 --> 00:00:35.860
It's going to take you to a screen
that looks kind of like this.

14
00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.100
You're going to want to click Arrow.

15
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.800
Arrow is the provider or the store
that is selling the board for us.

16
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.860
Then we have a screen that's
gonna pop up like this.

17
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.450
Where they're going to ask
you how many you want.

18
00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:50.780
So, buy 100 of them, right?

19
00:00:52.074 --> 00:00:53.383
>> At least 100.
>> At least 100.

20
00:00:53.383 --> 00:00:55.990
No, one, buy one.

21
00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.430
Hopefully they're in stock,
as you can see.

22
00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.080
>> Buy one for you, one for a friend.

23
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.020
>> One for you, one for a friend.

24
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.670
So, click Buy, View Cart and
then you're ready, right?

25
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:08.930
But you're not.

26
00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.180
So you need to register first with Arrow.

27
00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.800
Once you've set everything up,
got your cart all set up,

28
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.510
go click the Register button, you want
to be a new user, set up your account.

29
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.180
Finish your registration process,
they're gonna thank you,

30
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.530
and now you're actually ready to sign in.

31
00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.400
So provide your name, you're gonna want to
have it shipped to your house, give all

32
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.310
that vital information in order to get
the board properly delivered to you.

33
00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.910
>> I'm sure you guys have all
been through this before.

34
00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.070
>> Everyone's been through this process.

35
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.850
Confirm the shipping.

36
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.000
We have some of this stuff blacked out.

37
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.970
That's kind of where your
address is gonna show up and

38
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.200
your name,
your account name is going to show up.

39
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.390
You have your little total on the side.

40
00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:50.170
Click Continue.

41
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.690
Choose your shipping method.

42
00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.710
Maybe you're in a hurry to get this board,
you have an option for, I believe,

43
00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:57.610
next morning delivery.

44
00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.140
>> I would be in a hurry.

45
00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.250
I'm so excited I can't wait.

46
00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.050
>> We just did FedEx ground services.

47
00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:07.730
Confirmation, put in your
credit card information.

48
00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:13.890
Here's your last page, get it all set up,
make sure your information is correct.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.550
Place your order, and you are good to go.

All right.

51
