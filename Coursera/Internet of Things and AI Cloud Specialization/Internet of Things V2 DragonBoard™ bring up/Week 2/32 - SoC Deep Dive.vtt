00:00:03.826 --> 00:00:08.422
In this video, we're going to take a deep

2
00:00:08.422 --> 00:00:12.879
dive into the SOC of the 410 chip and

3
00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:17.056
what's in the 410 chip, just so

4
00:00:17.056 --> 00:00:22.924
you know all of the resources
you have available.

5
00:00:22.924 --> 00:00:23.761
The basic processing core for
the Snapdragon 410 is a Quad Core CPU.

6
00:00:23.761 --> 00:00:26.549
This is a 64-bit CPU
running at 1.2 gigahertz.

7
00:00:26.549 --> 00:00:31.222
And all four cores can run at
different speeds or at the same speed,

8
00:00:31.222 --> 00:00:33.569
depending on your compute load.

9
00:00:33.569 --> 00:00:38.124
And in fact, the system will dynamically
compute what your compute load is and

10
00:00:38.124 --> 00:00:41.310
adjust the speeds of each
of the cores appropriately.

11
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:48.150
Another major block here is a GPU,
which gives you graphics processing,

12
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.860
allowing you to render triangles and
very complex scenes.

13
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.720
Anything that you would see on a cellphone
while playing a game can be done

14
00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:57.605
by this GPU.

15
00:00:57.605 --> 00:01:02.628
The hardware also includes
video encode and decode,

16
00:01:02.628 --> 00:01:07.986
which means that incoming
video streams from the cameras

17
00:01:07.986 --> 00:01:12.354
can be encoded down to MP3 or H264 videos.

18
00:01:12.354 --> 00:01:18.095
And then the hardware can also decode
those videos using very little CPU time.

19
00:01:19.842 --> 00:01:27.085
More features include a hexagon DSP,
which allows you to run DSP programs and

20
00:01:27.085 --> 00:01:32.220
do audio processing, or
video processing on the DSP.

21
00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.170
The chip includes very sophisticated
power management, and in fact,

22
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.990
it has a separate processor to
do nothing but power management.

23
00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.310
This power management allows us to keep
the total power consumption to a minimum

24
00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:46.530
depending on your compute load.

25
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.740
External connectivity to this chip,
the chip has built into it Bluetooth,

26
00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.620
WiFi, and GPS circuitry.

27
00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:01.599
The connections external use a small front
end to down mix the signals to lower

28
00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:06.578
frequencies, and then all of the GPS
processing, the WiFi processing, and

29
00:02:06.578 --> 00:02:09.657
the Bluetooth processing
happens in the chip.

30
00:02:11.091 --> 00:02:16.292
The Snapdragon 410 also has a USB
connection which allows it to communicate

31
00:02:16.292 --> 00:02:21.964
with the outside world, allowing you to
connect peripherals, such as USB cameras,

32
00:02:21.964 --> 00:02:27.440
keyboards, mice, almost any USB device
you would normally connect to a laptop.

33
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.990
The output from the board, so
that you can connect a video monitor,

34
00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.650
is HDMI and the HDMI processing is handled
directly on the board and by the chip.

35
00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:46.260
The chip has two camera inputs that can
run two video streams simultaneously,

36
00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.120
and can, in fact, encode both
video streams simultaneously and

37
00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.900
store them to files, allowing you to do
significant video processing on the chip.

38
00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.390
We also have outputs for an LCD display.

39
00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.485
Although at this instant there
are no available LCD modules,

40
00:03:05.485 --> 00:03:07.881
they will be available soon.

41
00:03:07.881 --> 00:03:13.470
And finally,
connected to the chip is memory.

42
00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.690
So we have eMMC memory,
which is storage for your programs.

43
00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.962
So eMMC memory is this chip.

44
00:03:21.962 --> 00:03:26.250
That chip is also a multi-chip
module containing DRAM, so

45
00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.564
there's 1 GB of DRAM and 8 GB of eMMC
memory, which is plenty to hold your

46
00:03:31.564 --> 00:03:36.910
operating system, your programs, and
do the things that you want to do.

47
00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:43.210
The board is also capable of
connecting to an SD card.

48
00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:48.460
So if there's not enough storage in
8 gigabytes, you can put in a 64 or

49
00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:54.260
128 gigabyte SD card and
really improve your total storage.

50
00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.070
So this gives you an idea of all of
the features that are available inside

51
00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.433
the chipset, and
what you can do with them.

52
00:04:00.433 --> 00:04:06.660
For the resources, we have the usual
places, the Qualcomm Developer Network

53
00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.295
in which you can browse through
the development network.

54
00:04:11.295 --> 00:04:15.270
You will actually find the data sheet for
this processor chip.

55
00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.280
Finally, I'm going to talk
about the connectivity,

56
00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.210
all of the things that are connected to
the Snapdragon 410 that we haven't really

57
00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.310
discussed as part of the chip set.

58
00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.770
So we have the USB host ports.

59
00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.730
We have the USB debug ports, and

60
00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:38.730
we have the MIPI-CSI ports which are for
connection to cameras.

61
00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:46.310
We also have an audio codec
that allows the chip to

62
00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.940
connect to microphones, and
speakers, and headsets.

63
00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:56.800
And the audio codec is part of the PMIC,
which is the Power Management IC,

64
00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.630
which actually turns the voltage up and
down to the Snapdragon and

65
00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:03.410
turns off sections or
turns on sections as they're needed.

66
00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.990
We also start getting into some of
the other things that are used for

67
00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.720
connectivity.

68
00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:14.640
We have I2C ports, SPI ports, I2S ports,

69
00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:21.330
UR2 ports, and these allow connections of
what we'll call low speed peripherals.

70
00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.660
There's an entire bank of low
speed peripheral connections, and

71
00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:31.160
they're all brought to the surface of the
DragonBoard on the low speed connector.

72
00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.140
We also have GPIOs, so we can do a simple
things like turning lights on and off,

73
00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:39.557
turning relays on and off, or
sensing a single push button, or

74
00:05:39.557 --> 00:05:44.760
anything simple for connectivity.

75
00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:49.199
So this gives you a huge ecosystem
of things that you can add to

76
00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:54.380
the DragonBoard to build up your
system and build your dreams.
