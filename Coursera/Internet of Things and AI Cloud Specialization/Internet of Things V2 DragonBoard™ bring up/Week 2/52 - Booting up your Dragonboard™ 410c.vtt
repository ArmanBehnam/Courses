00:00:02.631 --> 00:00:05.260
Now we wanna tell you how to boot
up the board for the first time.

2
00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:08.322
You wanna be a little careful with it so
you don't damage it.

3
00:00:08.322 --> 00:00:10.298
But just make sure that
before you turn it on,

4
00:00:10.298 --> 00:00:13.834
you're gonna wanna connect an HDMI cable
to display, cuz you wanna be able to see

5
00:00:13.834 --> 00:00:17.320
what you're gonna be doing to see
it boot up for the first time.

6
00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.180
You then connect a mouse and
a keyboard to the USB slot.

7
00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.460
And, you have to ensure that you
have the proper configuration set on

8
00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.930
the boot configuration,
which Robert just talked about.

9
00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.570
So, again, that'd be 0,0,0,0,
so they'll all be off.

10
00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.820
And then, you can connect the power
adapter to the DC barrel jack.

11
00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.870
And, once that happens,
you should wait a few seconds, and

12
00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.720
you should see an Android
logo appear on the screen.

13
00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.780
If you're doing this for the first time.

14
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.950
As far as we know, they're all going to
come with Android pre-installed on them so

15
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.310
you should see Android come up.

16
00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:52.530
And then you'll be in a lock screen
kind of similar to your cell phone.

17
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.700
You'll be able to swipe to unlock, and
see all the different applications and

18
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.070
stuff on there.

19
00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.890
If this is not your first time,

20
00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.860
you can boot onto an SD card to
install a different operating system.

21
00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.630
And you can boot into Ubuntu and in the
future, they'll have Windows available.

22
00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.290
>> And, I mean, even though this
is the order we set things up,

23
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.750
you can swap things out of the USB ports.

24
00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.410
A lot of times,
it's just safer to do it this way,

25
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.470
because you will be handling
the board with your hands.

26
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.510
And if you have the DC jack hooked up
while you're handling it, there's more

27
00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.450
likeliness to short something or-
>> Yeah.

28
00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.070
>> Damage it because you have a current
flowing through all the devices.

29
00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.800
>> And your fingers conduct electricity,
so if you happen to inadvertently touch

30
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.120
something that shouldn't be connected,
you could short something out.

31
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.280
And it could most likely power it off.

32
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.310
But it could also damage
it if you're not careful.

33
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.250
>> You're less likely to do
that if it's not plugged in.
