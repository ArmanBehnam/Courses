00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.820
Moving on to the boot configuration
as mentioned in the outline.

2
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.260
We would like to talk about the dip
switches located behind the micro SD

3
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:14.250
card slot.

4
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.350
If you turn your board around,
as you can see on the screen,

5
00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:23.910
you see four little switches that are
actually hard to switch with your finger.

6
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.660
You might want to use an anti-static tool
or something to flip those switches.

7
00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.170
But if you look carefully,
they're numbered from one to four and

8
00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.360
they each have their own purpose.

9
00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:41.350
So we like to lay these out in kind of
a binary way where zero is off, one is on.

10
00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:42.210
And so

11
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.070
if we said 0-0-0-0, then essentially all
four of your dip switches should be off.

12
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.600
Looking at all four of these,
you can kinda see that it's HDMI select,

13
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.040
USB host, SD boot, and USB boot.

14
00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.380
Considering they serve different purposes,
we'll start with the first one.

15
00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.200
The HDMI select, kind of self-explanatory,

16
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.970
allows you to select between your
HDMI device which is hooked up here.

17
00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.175
You have your USB host,
which is basically toggling

18
00:01:11.175 --> 00:01:15.905
your ability to use your micro SD,
I'm sorry,

19
00:01:15.905 --> 00:01:21.150
your micro USB connection
to your computer host.

20
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.970
So if you were to turn that on,

21
00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.530
then you would be able to communicate
with your computer through the board.

22
00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.230
You have your SD boot,
which is gonna be used for

23
00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:32.310
purposes when you're loading
on a new operating system,

24
00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.750
flashing a new operating system
through the micro SD card slot.

25
00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.559
And then you have a USB boot,
which also serves the same purposes

26
00:01:40.559 --> 00:01:44.135
as booting it through
the micro SD card as well.

27
00:01:46.781 --> 00:01:51.081
Yeah, so talking about that a little
further, taking it a little deeper.

28
00:01:51.081 --> 00:01:55.593
The normal setup for your dip switches
when you first boot it on for

29
00:01:55.593 --> 00:01:59.860
the first time should be all off,
so all zeroes.

30
00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.870
That will boot you into your original
OS that came with the board.

31
00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.420
When you want to install
a new operating system,

32
00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.990
say you flashed a Ubuntu operating
system onto a micro SD card and

33
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.148
you would like to throw that on your
board, well, then you put the SD card in,

34
00:02:17.148 --> 00:02:21.850
you put 0-1-1-0, so dip switches 2 and
3 will be on in that,

35
00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.290
in fact, that is the configuration
we have there on the lower image.

36
00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.610
That is the booting configuration for
the micro SD card slot,

37
00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:36.060
and we will teach you how to do all
this later on in later lessons, but

38
00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.360
this is just kind of to get
familiar with the dip switches.

39
00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:44.570
And then you have external command
prompt through the micro USB where

40
00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:50.040
you would do 0-0-1-0 and,
I want you to note that if

41
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.570
you are just planning on using this board
regularly, a mouse, keyboard, Ubuntu,

42
00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:00.980
or Android, you want to make sure that
you do not have the micro USB plugged in,

43
00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.110
because that will render
the other USB ports inoperable.

44
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.370
Essentially, that's part of the board's
architecture where the USB and

45
00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.470
the micro USB are mutually exclusive.

46
00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:19.143
So if you would like to use the USBs,
you can't have the micro USB plugged in,

47
00:03:19.143 --> 00:03:23.090
regardless of how your dip
switches are configured.
