00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.300
You successfully made it to the end of Lesson One.

2
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.955
And with that comes a big homework assignment.

3
00:00:08.955 --> 00:00:10.285
Not too big, don't worry.

4
00:00:10.285 --> 00:00:13.830
Don't get too stressed out. We have a lot of fun stuff for you to do.

5
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.100
We also want to set you up for success.

6
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.380
And with that comes signing up to various other outlets,

7
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.795
that will allow you to succeed throughout the rest of this course,

8
00:00:22.795 --> 00:00:24.570
and the courses to follow.

9
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.625
First off, we would really like it if you visited the Qualcomm Developer Network.

10
00:00:29.625 --> 00:00:32.525
We recommend you poke around the different tools and resources.

11
00:00:32.525 --> 00:00:36.310
There's an entire section dedicated to the Dragonboard 410c.

12
00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.835
There are also several newsletters that are available to you.

13
00:00:39.835 --> 00:00:43.350
We recommend signing up to the one that interests you the most.

14
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.675
Now, after that, move on over to the 96boards.org website, and do the same thing.

15
00:00:49.675 --> 00:00:52.360
Explore the different resources available to you there.

16
00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.758
Check out the documentation,

17
00:00:53.758 --> 00:00:55.890
check out the backend GitHub repositories,

18
00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.990
and have some fun exploring what you can get to do with your Dragonboard 410c.

19
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.655
Now, these next three items are required,

20
00:01:02.655 --> 00:01:05.655
and we will be implementing a way for you to submit

21
00:01:05.655 --> 00:01:09.375
and receive credit for through the Coursera platform.

22
00:01:09.375 --> 00:01:13.500
It is required for you to attend at least one open hours episode.

23
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.120
Now, in the last video you saw a link to the open our website.

24
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.300
You also have it available here.

25
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.380
Please contact me while in

26
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.415
the open hours episode I'll provide you with a unique homework code,

27
00:01:26.415 --> 00:01:29.015
and you will submit that to receive credit.

28
00:01:29.015 --> 00:01:33.075
Next, register to the 96boards forum.

29
00:01:33.075 --> 00:01:36.360
When doing this you will be prompted to create handle.

30
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.302
This handle you must submit to receive credit in the Coursera assessment's.

31
00:01:42.302 --> 00:01:44.234
Next and last finally,

32
00:01:44.234 --> 00:01:45.688
last but not least,

33
00:01:45.688 --> 00:01:48.350
you need to sign up for the 96boards newsletter.

34
00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.830
Now, we recommend signing up to this because as mentioned in

35
00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:57.680
the last video there is a lot of really cutting edge information in there.

36
00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.200
The stuff that comes out first,

37
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.605
you're there to see it; New projects, contests,

38
00:02:03.605 --> 00:02:06.830
different documentation, all sorts of really fun stuff that's

39
00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.370
happening in the ecosystem that you need to be aware of.

40
00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:15.680
We promise not to send more than four emails a month and you can always unsubscribe.

41
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.360
But for the meantime,

42
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.270
we recommend you do this to make sure that you are set up for

43
00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.580
success throughout the remainder of this course and the courses to come.

44
00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:30.000
So, get to it and we will check your homeworks soon.
