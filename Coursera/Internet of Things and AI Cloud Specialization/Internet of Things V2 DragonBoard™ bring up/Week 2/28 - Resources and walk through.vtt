WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now, it's time to walk through the different resources that we've made

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.375
available to you for the remainder of this specialization.

3
00:00:06.375 --> 00:00:08.910
It's important that while you're going through this to take

4
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.850
notes of all the different links and URLs that we're providing to you,

5
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.130
so that you can poke around and get as much out of

6
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.390
this as possible throughout the course of the specialization.

7
00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.620
Now, one of the first places you're going to want to check out is

8
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.275
the Qualcomm Developer Network at developer.qualcomm.com.

9
00:00:23.275 --> 00:00:26.340
This is an excellent place to access tools and

10
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.715
resources that will help developers or you,

11
00:00:29.715 --> 00:00:34.590
build and integrate as well as optimize anything that you're developing in this course.

12
00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.215
So, just because you've gone and created one of the projects that we've pushed your way,

13
00:00:40.215 --> 00:00:42.075
that doesn't mean that you can't go find out what

14
00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:44.190
other people are developing and kind of adapt

15
00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.320
to new models and figure out

16
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.960
some other fun stuff to do with the projects that we've provided you.

17
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.460
You'll also find some very niche documentation on Qualcomm Developer Network.

18
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.830
This is very cool because you can explore deeper into

19
00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.550
the different chipsets that are available from Qualcomm,

20
00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.580
in particular, the Snapdragon 410E which is used in the DragonBoard 410C.

21
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.030
You'll get access to very specific blogs,

22
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.600
different projects that are available to you there as well,

23
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.055
and contests that you might want to enter.

24
00:01:11.055 --> 00:01:13.210
Every month, I know this in particular,

25
00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.870
Qualcomm announced as a developer of the month.

26
00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.630
And if you ever have the opportunity to get one of your projects

27
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.540
featured on there it's definitely worth checking out.

28
00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.560
Another cool thing about the Qualcomm Developer Network

29
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.810
would be the Qualcomm Snapdragon related announcements.

30
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.940
Now, these are announcements that you'll only

31
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.265
find on the Qualcomm Developer Network or of course,

32
00:01:32.265 --> 00:01:33.780
any of their social media channels,

33
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.147
so definitely check that out.

34
00:01:39.147 --> 00:01:43.270
The 96Boards Website is

35
00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.545
what I would like to call the one stop shop for anything 96Boards.

36
00:01:47.545 --> 00:01:50.800
And since the DragonBoard 410C is a 96Boards,

37
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.875
you'll find many, many resources on this Website.

38
00:01:54.875 --> 00:01:57.250
The goal of the 96Boards Website was to reduce

39
00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.970
the fragmentation and the redundancies across the web.

40
00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.510
So, when you go search for anything that has to do with the DragonBoard,

41
00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:09.250
we hope that you'll find it on the 96boards.org website.

42
00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.650
This means that even the things that we just talked

43
00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.275
about earlier with the Qualcomm developer network,

44
00:02:14.275 --> 00:02:17.275
a lot of their documentation will still be available

45
00:02:17.275 --> 00:02:21.505
on the DragonBoard landing page within 96boards.org.

46
00:02:21.505 --> 00:02:26.035
Not only is documentation and resources mirrored onto our website,

47
00:02:26.035 --> 00:02:28.480
we also host unique blogs and

48
00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.640
projects similar to what the Qualcomm developer network does,

49
00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.195
but on a little bit of a different parallel.

50
00:02:34.195 --> 00:02:39.325
So, you might find blogs that are related to DragonBoard 410C.

51
00:02:39.325 --> 00:02:43.090
However, unlike not only just community

52
00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.845
sponsored projects we also have projects that are done by 96Boards engineers,

53
00:02:47.845 --> 00:02:49.990
or people within Linaro,

54
00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:52.060
very cool place to check some stuff out.

55
00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.270
You'll also find things like compliance, specification,

56
00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:00.200
and all of our different partners that are part of this big initiative.

57
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.845
Along with 96Boards product line,

58
00:03:02.845 --> 00:03:06.810
accessories, and of course mezzanines to expand your development.

59
00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.170
This is what I like to call the ultimate crossroads for 96Boards.

60
00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.820
96Boards OpenHours.

61
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:23.260
So, this is a fun little initiative that was put forward in May of last year, May 2016.

62
00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:29.880
Now, the goal of this or the overarching view of

63
00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.580
what we wanted out of this was to bring community and

64
00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.895
developers together in a live open forum.

65
00:03:36.895 --> 00:03:41.330
Now, since then, we've done tens and tens of episodes.

66
00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.030
It's been consistent throughout over a year.

67
00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.370
Now, I know that when you're watching this it might not be exactly in that time span,

68
00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.295
but we've gone already almost 100 episodes,

69
00:03:51.295 --> 00:03:54.870
we've interviewed people from different industries,

70
00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.195
50 plus people we've interviewed,

71
00:03:57.195 --> 00:04:01.135
and we plan on continuing this effort for a long time.

72
00:04:01.135 --> 00:04:02.940
I'm actually the host of the show.

73
00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:09.755
And in general, we see a nice return of about 46 to one currently.

74
00:04:09.755 --> 00:04:12.240
So, that means that one of your community hours, you come,

75
00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.350
you attend the show,

76
00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:16.140
you're going to get a return of about 46 hours.

77
00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:20.420
That means that anything you say is well received.

78
00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:23.710
We'd love to have anyone that's interested and join us.

79
00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.525
Of course, you have access to our 96Boards and Linaro engineers,

80
00:04:27.525 --> 00:04:29.760
you'll have access to other participants that have been

81
00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.490
helping you out through the course of this specialization.

82
00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.570
And we'd love to just help you live,

83
00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.830
get your questions answered anything around Coursera,

84
00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.815
the DragonBoard 410C, bring it to our developers,

85
00:04:40.815 --> 00:04:44.085
bring it to me, and we'll have some fun trying to solve the problems.

86
00:04:44.085 --> 00:04:47.895
In general, the show is open source centric.

87
00:04:47.895 --> 00:04:50.855
So, we do focus on open source projects,

88
00:04:50.855 --> 00:04:54.285
open source initiatives, and it's just a lot of fun.

89
00:04:54.285 --> 00:04:59.687
So, we hope to see you there at 96boards.forward/openhours every week,

90
00:04:59.687 --> 00:05:01.990
Thursday at 4:00 pm, UTC.

91
00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.075
So, the time never changes.

92
00:05:05.075 --> 00:05:09.990
Here's some pictures of the things that we've done in OpenHours,

93
00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:11.890
some little fun snippets.

94
00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.470
In the slide, you can see here,

95
00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.665
we have Lawrence King who is on the top middle.

96
00:05:17.665 --> 00:05:20.580
Hopefully you'll get a chance to see some videos from him,

97
00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.150
but he was one of the original creators of the DragonBoard.

98
00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.310
So, very privileged to have him on the show on several occasions.

99
00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:31.835
We're also very lucky to have him take part in the specialization.

100
00:05:31.835 --> 00:05:34.265
So he'll be doing some videos as well.

101
00:05:34.265 --> 00:05:35.550
You look on the top right.

102
00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:40.750
We had a huge movement with a bunch of engineers from Brazil.

103
00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:44.140
They all participated, we brought them up to the Qualcomm Thinkabit Lab,

104
00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:45.820
and did a nice episode around,

105
00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.760
I think it was five or six projects that they had

106
00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.090
done which now are on their way to becoming products.

107
00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:54.460
So, very cool and as you can see

108
00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:58.200
just a fun interactive experience we try to theme it out and have fun.

109
00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:01.770
So, we hope to see you there again.

110
00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:05.765
96Boards community forums.

111
00:06:05.765 --> 00:06:09.200
The 96Boards community forums, is again,

112
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:13.100
another place where we try to reduce the redundancies and

113
00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:17.700
the fragmentation in the 96Boards Web space.

114
00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:22.550
So we hope this to be a nice place to congregate and bring

115
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:25.190
your questions as well as help other people in

116
00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:29.180
the community with questions they may have.

117
00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:34.010
A good thing about this particular forum is that you're going to find engineers,

118
00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:36.110
industry professionals from all of

119
00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:39.620
our different partner and member companies who come in,

120
00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:42.980
who are participating with 96Boards to answer your questions.

121
00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:46.790
So for instance, if you have a question about the DragonBoard 410C,

122
00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:50.930
and you don't see anyone from Coursera answering your questions,

123
00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:53.360
you need to go to the 96Boards forums,

124
00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.340
there you'll have people from 96Boards,

125
00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:57.800
people from Qualcomm, and the community all

126
00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:01.340
participating to help you get your questions answered.

127
00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:04.760
So, I would definitely suggest checking this out.

128
00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:07.875
You can get questions answered on 96Boards, on mezzanine,

129
00:07:07.875 --> 00:07:10.955
general questions just about the program itself,

130
00:07:10.955 --> 00:07:13.985
specification adjustments, the compliance,

131
00:07:13.985 --> 00:07:15.320
all sorts of cool stuff.

132
00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:18.273
So, please go visit discuss.96boards.org,

133
00:07:18.273 --> 00:07:27.505
there you'll find a bunch of stuff dedicated to helping you, bunch of people.

134
00:07:27.505 --> 00:07:35.620
The 96Boards newsletter is a new initiative that started roughly the beginning of 2017.

135
00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:40.715
You can go visit it at www.96boards.org/digest.

136
00:07:40.715 --> 00:07:45.620
This newsletter is a maximum once per week newsletter.

137
00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:47.630
That is, I would say,

138
00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:49.760
geared towards having fun.

139
00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:51.990
Now, what we do there is we try to provide

140
00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:56.075
a weekly picture or a picture of the week as we call it,

141
00:07:56.075 --> 00:07:57.770
where people from the community,

142
00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:00.140
engineers from around the world can send us some of

143
00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:03.455
the fun stuff that they're doing around 96Boards.

144
00:08:03.455 --> 00:08:04.715
We host the picture,

145
00:08:04.715 --> 00:08:06.275
we give credit of course,

146
00:08:06.275 --> 00:08:08.800
and then we share any social media links.

147
00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.630
The digest is also

148
00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:15.620
welcoming of anyone who would like to write little snippets about their company,

149
00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:20.090
about their projects, and we also feature any new projects that become

150
00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:25.005
available on the 96Boards or developer.qualcomm.com websites.

151
00:08:25.005 --> 00:08:29.225
So, another place where we kind of try to get the information

152
00:08:29.225 --> 00:08:33.845
and all the cool stuff that's going around in the 96Boards ecosystem out to you,

153
00:08:33.845 --> 00:08:35.690
and if you would like to participate,

154
00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:37.065
you can always sign up.

155
00:08:37.065 --> 00:08:38.535
We would encourage you to do so.

156
00:08:38.535 --> 00:08:40.815
It's another resource for you to take advantage of.

157
00:08:40.815 --> 00:08:44.525
And also, talking about OpenHours,

158
00:08:44.525 --> 00:08:49.385
we do announce and give insight as to what has happened in the previous week,

159
00:08:49.385 --> 00:08:50.960
and what's going to happen in the next week.

160
00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:54.680
So, this is your kind of way to be ahead of the curve with

161
00:08:54.680 --> 00:09:00.870
regards to OpenHours and what's going to be going on. Definitely sign up.

162
00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:05.870
IRC or otherwise known as

163
00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:10.160
Internet Relay Chat is something that's used in many development communities.

164
00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:17.715
Now, we have several channels available for you to access our engineers 24 hours a day.

165
00:09:17.715 --> 00:09:20.480
I mean 24 hours because we are literally

166
00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:23.950
working in 25 different countries around the world,

167
00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:26.870
at least when I'm talking Linaro 96Boards.

168
00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:28.520
You also have people from Qualcomm and

169
00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:31.490
other companies joining us in this Internet Relay Chat,

170
00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:34.573
available to you live and hopefully,

171
00:09:34.573 --> 00:09:36.140
you can get your questions answered.

172
00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:38.390
There are three channels that I have listed here.

173
00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:41.720
However, there are many more that you could try out but

174
00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:46.115
#96Boards, #OpenHours, and #Linaro.

175
00:09:46.115 --> 00:09:49.810
Ideal opportunities for you to kind of get more involved

176
00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:55.500
and ask us questions in a nice chat environment.

177
00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:57.035
So, it's pretty fun.

178
00:09:57.035 --> 00:09:58.280
I'm there all the time.

179
00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:03.620
I have a particular license or program called IRC Cloud,

180
00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:07.175
you go sign up a costs of few bucks a month,

181
00:10:07.175 --> 00:10:08.990
and you're always signed in.

182
00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:11.210
So, if you were out there pinging me,

183
00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:14.000
you message me, my cell phone lights up.

184
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.695
There are free services such as freenode which is webchat.freenode.net.

185
00:10:19.695 --> 00:10:22.700
That service, I would definitely suggest for trying out if you want

186
00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:26.025
to go in there and just poke around or get a few questions answered, that's great.

187
00:10:26.025 --> 00:10:30.385
However, we'd love to have you as a long term member in any of our chat channels.

188
00:10:30.385 --> 00:10:33.395
So, feel free to join us on any of those hashtags there,

189
00:10:33.395 --> 00:10:38.950
and what does it contribute to the course.

190
00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:46.415
Social media is another great way for you to get a hold of us.

191
00:10:46.415 --> 00:10:49.260
Now, not only getting a hold of us,

192
00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:55.065
but finding out what's new and exciting in the ecosystem that you are joining.

193
00:10:55.065 --> 00:10:58.680
So, you can see I've posted several different outlets here,

194
00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:01.955
YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Instagram.

195
00:11:01.955 --> 00:11:06.060
You can find links to both 96Boards and

196
00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:11.040
Qualcomm as well as my personal social media outlets.

197
00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:15.180
Personally, I like to make sure that I gear all of

198
00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:20.125
my social media towards helping folks from 96Boards and Linaro.

199
00:11:20.125 --> 00:11:23.190
So, if you are interested in following,

200
00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:26.505
or hanging out with me online,

201
00:11:26.505 --> 00:11:27.865
you can find me there.

202
00:11:27.865 --> 00:11:32.970
If you want to patronize the 96Boards or Qualcomm brands,

203
00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:35.285
then please join us there.

204
00:11:35.285 --> 00:11:39.660
We're available to you and want to make sure that you can utilize these resources.

205
00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:40.980
There's also a lot of really cool things

206
00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:45.190
that many of the people within these companies and myself do.

207
00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:46.515
We go to different events,

208
00:11:46.515 --> 00:11:48.120
we go to different conferences,

209
00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:51.400
we do speeches, and push out videos and workshops.

210
00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:53.730
So, all of this stuff gets outlined

211
00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:56.515
and pushed out through the different social media channels.

212
00:11:56.515 --> 00:11:59.010
Definitely a good opportunity for you to keep in touch

213
00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:03.360
with what's going on in the 96Boards ecosystem.

214
00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:07.585
So, at the end of all of this,

215
00:12:07.585 --> 00:12:11.905
I've summarized the resources here that we've gone over.

216
00:12:11.905 --> 00:12:13.180
You have a list of

217
00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:17.725
not only the Qualcomm developer network resources that you can find there,

218
00:12:17.725 --> 00:12:20.655
all of the 96Boards pages that we've discussed,

219
00:12:20.655 --> 00:12:24.290
and a summary of the social media outlets.

220
00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:26.155
Now, I want to remind you, right here,

221
00:12:26.155 --> 00:12:30.850
you have our freenode IRC cloud chat rooms where you can join,

222
00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:34.740
and get access to us 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

223
00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:36.715
Were there kind of just hanging out all the time.

224
00:12:36.715 --> 00:12:41.020
So, make an effort to kind of join us and have some fun

225
00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:47.660
getting more involved with the DragonBoard 410C and the 96Boards community.
