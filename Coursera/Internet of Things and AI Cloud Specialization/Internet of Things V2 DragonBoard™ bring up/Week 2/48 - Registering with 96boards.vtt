00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:04.940
We wanna take you through the process
of getting registered at 96boards.

2
00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:08.610
This is very important if you wanna be
able to have access to the forums and

3
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:09.210
things like that.

4
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.380
You know, there's a lot of help you
can get, and if you ever get stuck,

5
00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.570
you can go to the forums or
I guess reference for our videos.

6
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.340
>> Yeah, we've found it very useful,
accessing the forums.

7
00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:20.690
They're very responsive on there.

8
00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:21.620
>> They respond really quickly.

9
00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:22.930
>> Yeah.
>> So it's a good idea to get

10
00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:23.720
registered with 96Boards.

11
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.000
>> Yeah, there's a lot of developers on
there that actually work with Linaro that

12
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.650
have helped us out immensely.

13
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.010
>> Yeah, so you wanna start off, you wanna
go back to the 96boards.org website.

14
00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.920
And then you can go to forums, and

15
00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.690
it will ask you to be able to sign in or
register for the first time.

16
00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.910
So you'll click on
the little button register.

17
00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.580
>> You can access the forums
without having registered, but

18
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.530
if you want to post anything
>> Yeah

19
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.280
>> Or create a topic

20
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.230
then you're gonna need to register.

21
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.740
>> All right, and then so then you just
have to go through, and it's the usual

22
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.250
process of getting registered,
as you find from most websites.

23
00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.730
You're gonna have to enter in a user name,
an email,

24
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.850
I think a password, and
you know go through all that.

25
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.260
I think that there's a verification
email that you have to go to and

26
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:07.290
click on and-
>> Yeah,

27
00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.210
they actually send you a password.

28
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.220
So when you register, they're gonna send
you this really long weird password.

29
00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:19.240
Copy paste it into the screen you can see
right here, and then basically just go

30
00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.620
in and adjust it for the password that you
would like inside your account settings.

31
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:25.120
>> Yeah.
