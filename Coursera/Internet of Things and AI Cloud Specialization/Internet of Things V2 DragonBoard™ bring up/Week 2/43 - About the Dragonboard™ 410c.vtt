00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.169
We just wanted to take a chance today to
get you guys introduced to the board, and

2
00:00:06.169 --> 00:00:09.738
we want to talk about some of its good
components, and also kind of give you

3
00:00:09.738 --> 00:00:13.390
an idea of what kinds of the things
you can do with the DragonBoard 410c.

4
00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:13.950
>> Like he said,

5
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.710
we'd like to talk to you about some
of the cool features on the board.

6
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.600
Starting off with the Qualcomm Snapdragon
processor, 400 series processor.

7
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.480
Right out of the box we noticed
immediately when we plugged it in for

8
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.240
the first time,
how fast this processor really is.

9
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.770
Running Android, Unbuntu,
everything just ran flawlessly, and

10
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.250
you'll actually notice as we go through
a lot of our projects in this course

11
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.090
it's able to handle it just perfectly.

12
00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.090
Another cool thing about this
board is the connectivity.

13
00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.502
So, we have Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and
GPS built in, right into the board.

14
00:00:46.502 --> 00:00:49.600
So unlike other boards on the market,

15
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.470
you have to waste a USB slot on
a Dongle or something like that,

16
00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.350
just to get connected to the internet
whereas this one just has a built-in.

17
00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.040
We had no problems with it and
it's actually a really cool feature.

18
00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:07.550
Another thing is just it's out of the box,
ready to program.

19
00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.040
So if you prefer programming in Android,

20
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.310
Java, throw on the Android operating
system and get Android Studio.

21
00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.220
Start making your first application.

22
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.860
If you feel like doing C or

23
00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.560
Python, throw on Ubuntu operating system,
and get going with that.

24
00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.070
We will throughout this course
show you how to do both methods or

25
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.840
both languages and
have some fun with that.

26
00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.730
>> It's also important to note that
the board is compliant with 96Boards

27
00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.170
Consumer Edition specification.

28
00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.535
>> So if you have any ribbon cables or
shields or something like that

29
00:01:42.535 --> 00:01:47.020
you purchased for another board,
they should be compatible with this one.

30
00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.257
This board has been just a great product,
and

31
00:01:50.257 --> 00:01:54.990
it's been really ideal for
use with embedded systems.

32
00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.300
It's given us a lot of inspiration for
future projects.

33
00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.960
We're looking at creating
an internet of things project.

34
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.200
And for those of you who don't know
what that means it's basically what

35
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.950
we're going to use the DragonBoard
as kind of a central hub, or

36
00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.480
like a brain of the system,

37
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:13.170
and we'll be able to use it to control
a whole lot of other little things.

38
00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.960
In the sense that, you know, personally
I wanted to be able to use the board to,

39
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.360
for my phone, trigger an application that
could open a door or turn on a light or

40
00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.710
turn on my television,
kinda things like that.

41
00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.625
And so one of our future projects
we'll have, in course three,

42
00:02:29.625 --> 00:02:32.820
we'll actually gonna be making
a bunch of little projects, and

43
00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.210
then later on connect them all
together into one central thing.

44
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:39.310
And so they'll all work together and
should be a lot of fun.

45
00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:40.780
>> Yeah,
we're gonna walk you through that process.

46
00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.800
It's gonna be a lot of fun, yeah.

47
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.840
On that same note, we'd like to talk to
you about some of the cool things you can

48
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.130
actually do with this board.

49
00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.760
Especially when it comes
to internet of things.

50
00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.410
You have robotics, of course robotics.

51
00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.520
I mean we're talking about an all in one
board with a very powerful processor and

52
00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.130
GPIO interfaces.

53
00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.810
So.

54
00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:05.740
You're gonna be able to manipulate all
sorts of cool robotics like projects.

55
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.790
You can run cameras create
medical devices and

56
00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.988
we've even been told you can
make vending machines, so.

57
00:03:11.988 --> 00:03:12.870
[LAUGH]
>> [LAUGH] Yeah.

58
00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.620
>> We won't be doing that, but
it sounds like a lot of fun, so

59
00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.830
you know, if that's what you'd like to do,
go for it.

60
00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.300
Yeah, and there's all kinds of
fun things you can use this for

61
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.130
and a lot of other bigger,
larger applications.

62
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.350
For example, if you wanted to make
a smart building or a smart home.

63
00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.170
Or if you wanted to set up
a system with solar panels.

64
00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:32.520
Something kind of like a project me and

65
00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.600
him worked on before where you use
the board as a central hub to be able to

66
00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.080
control a lot of different like sensors
and voltages and things like that.

67
00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.640
There's also uses in making LED signs so

68
00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.700
you can have those big boards of LEDs and
get it to display messages.

69
00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.715
We'll be working out the small scale
version of that later on in course three

70
00:03:51.715 --> 00:03:54.710
but there's so many applications for this.

71
00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:57.258
The options are endless.

72
00:03:57.258 --> 00:03:59.098
You can do almost anything with it.

73
00:03:59.098 --> 00:04:03.111
>> When he talks about smart buildings,
there's a lot of stuff on the market

74
00:04:03.111 --> 00:04:07.188
right now where you can just go buy a
device and just put it into your house and

75
00:04:07.188 --> 00:04:10.130
start working, but
I mean where's the fun in that?

76
00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.620
We're going to show you
how to build it yourself.

77
00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:13.850
We look forward to that.
