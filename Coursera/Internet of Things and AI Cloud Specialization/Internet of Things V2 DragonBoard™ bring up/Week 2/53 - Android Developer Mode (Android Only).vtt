00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.000
You've booted up your board for
the first time,

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.220
you are in Android if that was
your default operating system.

3
00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.920
And, this time we'd like to talk to
you a little bit about getting ready

4
00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.960
to develop for your board.

5
00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.130
>> Yeah, I'm sure you're excited about
wanting to get to some programming.

6
00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.340
But there has to be a couple of things
checked off before we can get to there.

7
00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.000
>> Yeah, I know, of course.

8
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.810
In order to do that,
we're going to show you a little secret.

9
00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.240
Your gonna need to go in to activate
your USB debugging, which is essentially

10
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.090
granting yourself developer options
on your Android operating system.

11
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.162
So, in order to do this, you are going
to access the Applications and

12
00:00:41.162 --> 00:00:45.016
click the settings icon
inside your Applications.

13
00:00:45.016 --> 00:00:50.184
A screen similar to this will show up,
this is a generic Android settings lists,

14
00:00:50.184 --> 00:00:53.815
I guess you can say, but
they all are very similar.

15
00:00:53.815 --> 00:00:55.623
>> It's the same thing you
would find on your cell phone

16
00:00:55.623 --> 00:00:56.866
if you have another Android phone.

17
00:00:56.866 --> 00:00:58.877
>> Yeah, you can actually
probably go find that right now

18
00:00:58.877 --> 00:00:59.979
if you have an Android phone.

19
00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:02.945
But you're gonna go look for
the tab that says About Phone,

20
00:01:02.945 --> 00:01:05.210
you're gonna click the About Phone button.

21
00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.820
You're gonna locate your Build number
within the next list that prompts you and

22
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.640
you're going to start
tapping your Build number,

23
00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.500
in fact you're gonna tap it seven times.

24
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.820
A little list will start
popping up above it saying,

25
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.680
oh you've tapped it this many times,
tap it this many more to go.

26
00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.220
And so after you've tapped it seven times,

27
00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.655
it's going to scream at you and
say you're now a developer.

28
00:01:27.655 --> 00:01:30.360
>> [LAUGH]
>> Yay, you're a developer.

29
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:37.165
All right, so you have officially
unlocked the Developer options tab.

30
00:01:37.165 --> 00:01:39.915
What you're gonna do is, you're gonna
go find the Developer options tab,

31
00:01:39.915 --> 00:01:44.365
it's back in your basic Settings list,
you're gonna click on that, and you're

32
00:01:44.365 --> 00:01:49.075
gonna locate the USB debugging tab, and
you're gonna make sure that that's active.

33
00:01:49.075 --> 00:01:53.625
Most of the times, when you active
your USB debugging, I'm sorry,

34
00:01:53.625 --> 00:01:58.516
when you activate your Developer options
your USB debugging will usually just

35
00:01:58.516 --> 00:02:00.300
default active.

36
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:06.140
This USB debugging is very important
because without it you don't really have

37
00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:13.058
access through the micro USB port to send
or push applications on to the board.

38
00:02:13.058 --> 00:02:17.270
Later on when we download
the IDE Android Studio you

39
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.750
will need the USB debugging to create your
applications and push them onto the board.

40
00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.960
>> I even believe accessing through
the terminal through the SDK tools

41
00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.150
requires this to be enabled.

42
00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.420
So if you run into any issues with that
make sure you check off USB debugging.

43
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.280
>> Yeah, that's true.

44
00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.600
A lot of board configurations can be
done just strictly through the terminal,

45
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.750
plugged in through the USB
with your PC host.

46
00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.150
So yeah, definitely get that USB
debugging activated as soon as possible.
