00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:05.380
We'll just take you through a few
steps to make sure that you care for

2
00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:06.380
the board appropriately.

3
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.440
It can be damaged quite easily if you're
not careful, and so therefore we need to

4
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.590
make sure that you're not doing anything
you shouldn't be doing with it.

5
00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:19.030
To start off, I've been asked this
a few times by several people,

6
00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:21.760
what components can I touch?

7
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.620
Where can I stick my fingers on the board?

8
00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:25.230
And the simple answer is,

9
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.140
is you shouldn't be touching it
anymore than you should have to.

10
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.850
If you do have to grab it,
grab it by the sides.

11
00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.230
You don't want to be touching down on any
of the components, because again your

12
00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.680
fingers conduct electricity and so
you can quite easily short the board.

13
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.580
Not to mention your hands are oily,

14
00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.720
and sometimes you could be in a hot room
working and sweating and stuff like that.

15
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.520
It's best just not to touch it directly,
except for where you need to hold it to be

16
00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.360
able to plug in a USB slot,
HDMI cables, things like that.

17
00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.960
Or GPIOs or
whatever you happen to be doing.

18
00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.220
You should the board on
a flat level surface so

19
00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.470
that it can breathe appropriately.

20
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.380
It has to be able to get a nice wind flow
around it because you don't want it to

21
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:05.470
get warm or anything like that.

22
00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.120
Just like any kind of computer, you have
to have room for ventilation, right?

23
00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.710
>> But you'll notice also,
if you're board is getting too hot,

24
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.539
it will start to perform less.

25
00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.730
Like any computer, so that's basically
how you overclock computers,

26
00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.300
is by keeping it cool.

27
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.210
So you want it to stay nice and cool,
that's a good reason to keep it flat and

28
00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:26.070
good ventilation.

29
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.550
>> Yeah if you keep it
in a well ventilated,

30
00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.990
you should have no problem keeping
it under the right temperature.

31
00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.840
And you also want to avoid
anything that's conductive.

32
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.580
So don't place it on like wires or
anything like that,

33
00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.710
like exposed wires on your desk or
something like that.

34
00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.210
Cause again, just like your fingers, they
could short out some of the components and

35
00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.830
do some serious damage to the board.

36
00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.490
And you also want to make
sure that you're not touching

37
00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:53.910
the stuff that's prone to static.

38
00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.622
So certain types of plastic and
things like that, like a balloon.

39
00:01:56.622 --> 00:01:58.997
I don't know if you've ever took
a balloon and rubbed it on your head and

40
00:01:58.997 --> 00:02:00.580
generate static electricity.

41
00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.425
Something like that could just
the same cause damage to the board.

42
00:02:04.425 --> 00:02:08.680
>> Yeah no, in fact that's why
the board comes in an anti-static bag.

43
00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.736
You can find these bags all
around electronic stores.

44
00:02:12.736 --> 00:02:15.876
It''s really good if you want
to place your board somewhere.

45
00:02:15.876 --> 00:02:19.155
Put the bag down first place it
on top of the anti-static bag.

46
00:02:19.155 --> 00:02:24.053
You can ruin your board just by
rubbing it up against the wrong

47
00:02:24.053 --> 00:02:28.390
kind of plastic, so yeah,
definitely a good point.

48
00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.690
>> Make sure you always properly shut down
the board before you unplug the power.

49
00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:40.805
If you continuously shut it off by
just pulling the power cord out,

50
00:02:40.805 --> 00:02:44.873
you can corrupt files and
basically break the board,

51
00:02:44.873 --> 00:02:50.680
in which case you'll have to erase your
operating system and reflash it on.

52
00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.915
And which never is never fun because
then you lose all the files you've been

53
00:02:53.915 --> 00:02:55.090
working on.

54
00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.510
So always properly shut it down
first before unpowering it.

55
00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.003
>> Looks like I jumped the gun
on the anti-static container.

56
00:03:02.003 --> 00:03:04.360
>> [LAUGH]
>> But yeah, so you know,

57
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.260
definitely comes with the anti-static
bag or the anti-static container.

58
00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.110
Keep it in there.

59
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.919
There are special foams you can
get better anti-static foams.

60
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.790
Yeah, defiantly keep an eye on that.

61
00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.760
>> Yeah, also, make sure that
you use approved power adapters.

62
00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.370
As we said once in an earlier lesson,

63
00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.890
that if you use too high of a voltage,for
a power adapter, you could actually melt,

64
00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.740
burn, destroy, blow up, the board.

65
00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:34.130
This one does have a really good range.

66
00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:35.910
I think it goes up to,
I think we said, 6.5 to 18 volts.

67
00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.570
>> Yeah, I believe so.

68
00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.330
>> And two amps, but
you shouldn't be going over that, and

69
00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.060
you also don't wanna be going under that.

70
00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.540
Because, some things might not turn on or

71
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.590
not have enough power
to activate anything.

72
00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.320
I mean,
we're more concerned with going over that.

73
00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.170
But that's something
that I've done before.

74
00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.060
I've hooked a 12 volt adaptor
into a 5 volt board and

75
00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.300
it just didn't go out well so.

76
00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.470
>> Yeah I'd also recommend
not going around the board,

77
00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:05.340
poking around too deep because I
think there was one time where

78
00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.000
I went into another board and just started
kind of deleting stuff just to clear up

79
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.690
space turns out I deleted
a bunch of partition tables.

80
00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.720
And yeah, so that's also something.

81
00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.290
If you're going to go around deleting
stuff, you might want to do the research

82
00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.470
before you just start just
deleting anything you want.

83
00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:23.360
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah.

84
00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.110
And also a lot.

85
00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.760
A lot of work we're gonna be
doing is by gaining root access.

86
00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.630
So you're gonna have access
to all the files you want,

87
00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.310
which means you can do some damage if
you don't follow the proper protocols.
