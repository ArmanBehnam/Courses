00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:04.990
In this video we're going to
talk about onboard storage.

2
00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:08.520
We touched lightly on onboard
storage in the previous video.

3
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:13.680
In this video we'll go into more details
on possible types of onboard storage,

4
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.250
and storage we actually selected
to put into the DragonBoard 410.

5
00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.710
So there are numerous storage
technologies for storing programs,

6
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.840
videos, data, word files,
whatever you would like to store.

7
00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.390
The most common storage
technologies are eMMC,

8
00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.360
which is an embedded multimedia card.

9
00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.790
And that's the one that's
on the DragonBoard.

10
00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:42.105
There's universal flash storage,
which is a newer technology than eMMC.

11
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.540
There is solid state drives,

12
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.660
in which you have probably got
a solid state drive in your laptop.

13
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:55.170
We have the classic magnetic spinning
hard drives which have their advantages,

14
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.340
and SD cards.

15
00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.430
So a little more detail,
I'll start from the bottom up.

16
00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.756
Secure Digital cards are very small.

17
00:01:03.756 --> 00:01:08.313
They take a very little space and
they're easily removable from the system.

18
00:01:08.313 --> 00:01:13.080
But the performance of transfer to and
from the card is not very good.

19
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.210
Magnetic drives, the spinning hard drives,
don't have great performance.

20
00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.825
But they have incredibly large capacities,

21
00:01:21.825 --> 00:01:26.450
much larger than any of the other storage
media that we're talking about here.

22
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.223
The solid state drives
can be very fast and

23
00:01:31.223 --> 00:01:36.279
have reasonably large capacities,
not as large as the magnetic.

24
00:01:36.279 --> 00:01:40.854
But they use a lot of power,
that's how they achieve their speed.

25
00:01:40.854 --> 00:01:45.408
The universal flash storage has
very high transfer speeds between

26
00:01:45.408 --> 00:01:48.092
the flash storage itself and the SoC but

27
00:01:48.092 --> 00:01:53.250
it's a very new technology and
very expensive because it's new.

28
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.580
And finally there's the embedded
multimedia card which we selected for

29
00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:58.265
the DragonBoard.

30
00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.260
eMMC is significantly faster
than SD card because it has

31
00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.770
an 8-bit wide interface instead
of a 4-bit wide interface.

32
00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.830
So that gives you double the speed,
even at the same clock rates.

33
00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.250
But it's also capable of much higher
clock rates than the SD card.

34
00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.510
Because eMMC is soldered
directly to the board,

35
00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.090
the signals can travel
across the board much faster

36
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.140
than they can travel across
the connector that connects an SD card.

37
00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:34.260
So this gives eMMC a huge boost
in performance over SD card.

38
00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.504
This is the reason we chose eMMC for
the DragonBoard.

39
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.960
The other advantage to the eMMC
is because it's embedded

40
00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.870
we were able to get a version that
had the DRAM in the same package.

41
00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.010
Because the two memories are in
one package this made the board

42
00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.360
significantly smaller and less expensive.

43
00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.620
So all good reasons for
why you would want to use eMMC.

44
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.170
But what if the amount of eMMC we put on
the board isn't enough for your program?.

45
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:12.197
Well, you can always add a solid state
drive by plugging it into the USB port.

46
00:03:12.197 --> 00:03:17.590
You can add a magnetic spinning drive
by plugging it into the USB port.

47
00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.010
And we have an SD card slot
available right on the board so

48
00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.650
that you can expand the storage
to achieve any amount of

49
00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.290
storage you need to build things like
file severs, multimedia servers.

50
00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.160
So, for instance,
a spinning hard drive would be a very good

51
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.190
choice if you want to store
all of your videos, and

52
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.800
then use the DragonBoard to play them back
as part of your home multimedia system.

53
00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.093
As usual, we have more resources
at the Qualcomm Developer Network.

54
00:03:48.093 --> 00:03:52.355
And invite you to browse through
the Qualcomm Developer Network and

55
00:03:52.355 --> 00:03:57.212
take a look at some of the projects that
have actually used external storage,

56
00:03:57.212 --> 00:04:01.720
have built home media servers, and
many other interesting projects.
