1
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.900
Now it's time to talk to you about the
Mezzanine Community Initiative we've been

2
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:07.970
kind of hinting out throughout
the course over the last few videos.

3
00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.230
Now, I know we've been talking
about this mezzanine ecosystem and

4
00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:14.224
everything that it entails.

5
00:00:14.224 --> 00:00:18.840
But it's not as easy to just say, hey,
go do this, go build the mezzanine,

6
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.310
without offering you the means or
the channels for which to do so.

7
00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.360
Now that is where the Mezzanine
Community Initiative was born.

8
00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.960
So in this video, we're going to
to talk you about the initiative.

9
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.460
What exactly is it?

10
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.260
What is it?
How can you find out more about it?

11
00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.940
How you contribute and
in what ways you can contribute.

12
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.080
What is the pipeline of mezzanines
that are going to be coming out

13
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.910
over the course of
hopefully the near future.

14
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.293
Acknowledgements for
the repository itself.

15
00:00:47.293 --> 00:00:50.309
Some of our key contributors and
the people who are maintaining it.

16
00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.760
And then how you can get involved.

17
00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.820
And for those of you who
are checking out the slide here,

18
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.930
you can see there's some
mezzanines on the slide.

19
00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.730
These were not made by big companies.

20
00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.060
These were made by people like you,
people in the community,

21
00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.900
people who just wanted to get
involved building something for

22
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.310
their own use that they then allowed
the community to consume and use as well.

23
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.010
So again,

24
00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.780
a very good initiative that's still in
its infancy but already showing results.

25
00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.173
So kudos to everyone that's
already been involved.

26
00:01:17.173 --> 00:01:21.780
Now I can bubble on about
the Mezzanine Initiative.

27
00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.310
The best thing for
you to do is to go read about it.

28
00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.642
We've already put time into
the repository, there's an about section,

29
00:01:27.642 --> 00:01:29.030
how to contribute.

30
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.780
There's a nice little section for learning
our contribution policy, so to say.

31
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.480
You can find our boards that have already
been made, different stuff in there.

32
00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.344
There's a lot to read about.

33
00:01:39.344 --> 00:01:41.860
github.com/96boards/mezzanine-community.

34
00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:47.870
Please check that out,
read some more and if you have any

35
00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:52.690
things that you would like us to know
drop us a line in the issue section.

36
00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.700
So there's a way to contribute already.

37
00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.710
If you feel that you want to know
something about the section that's

38
00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.670
not already documented in the repo,
just drop us a line.

39
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.760
Now, why was this Mezzanine formed?

40
00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.430
And this is kind of a myth,
I want to touch on this.

41
00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.460
I thought it was just kind of fun,
but if you build it, they will come.

42
00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:17.480
Now, this Mezzanine Initiative
wasn't necessarily formed because

43
00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.490
we wanted to create something grand
that we could own, 96Boards could own.

44
00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.030
This was created by community.

45
00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.040
This is created by community and
for community.

46
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.780
Now, looking at, if you build it they
will come, that's not entirely true.

47
00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:36.330
I call it a myth, because our focus is not
just to build something that nobody wants.

48
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.300
We want to build something
that everybody wants, or

49
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.820
at least a lot of people want, right?

50
00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.170
So if you build it, document it,
market it and maintain it, they'll come.

51
00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.230
And if you do it properly, they will stay
and that's the goal of this initiative.

52
00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.410
We want to make sure that the people
who are getting involved in this,

53
00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:59.370
genuinely care about the well-being of the
community and consuming everyone's needs.

54
00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.200
The win, win, win of open source and
that's what we're really geared towards.

55
00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.160
We really want to set that as
an example for this initiative, and

56
00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.730
the initiatives to come.

57
00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.230
So for those of you who want to get
started with the Mezzanine Initiative,

58
00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:13.135
remember this motto.

59
00:03:13.135 --> 00:03:16.210
[LAUGH]
>> And I think you hit a very good point.

60
00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:19.300
For those who want to get started, right?

61
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.360
So I think I have mentioned
this to you before,

62
00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.750
I am more of a software
applications development guy.

63
00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.810
So hardware design is always
that hurdle for me to cross.

64
00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:35.480
It's taking that first step into that
space is always daunting for me, right?

65
00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.710
Since the Mezzanine ecosystem is very,
very defined,

66
00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:44.750
like we talked about this with the
guidelines on how to develop a Mezzanine.

67
00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.940
And with the whole open source community
where somebody can come in and

68
00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.260
consume work that has already been done
by these great industry professionals.

69
00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.680
It's a a very good starting point for

70
00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.250
somebody who is starting
off in hardware design.

71
00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.720
Not just 96Board ecosystem but

72
00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.250
somebody who wants to play
around with hardware design.

73
00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.550
It's a good starting point.
>> Absolutely, and

74
00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:07.170
in fact, this is, you can see it,
it's in bold, it's the last point here.

75
00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.237
This is a great entry point, right?

76
00:04:09.237 --> 00:04:12.799
So, we'll talk about that a little
more as we elaborate on this.

77
00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:18.850
But what is this repository and
how can you contribute to it?

78
00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:21.330
It is a open source repository, right?

79
00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:27.050
Now, we've tried our best to make sure
that the license is on this repository

80
00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.960
because there is a barrier of entering,
and you have to learn how to do things.

81
00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.670
And getting used to open source,
in general,

82
00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:36.910
if you aren't already familiar
with it can be slightly daunting.

83
00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.150
So we've tried to make
the licenses as loose as possible.

84
00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.940
You can consume very openly

85
00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.960
our templates which we have many
to choose from at this point now.

86
00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.440
You can consume very openly and
you can just start plugging away.

87
00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.120
Getting familiar with different
computer rated design programs that

88
00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.310
are template catered too.

89
00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.940
And then when you've created something and
you want to contribute it back to our

90
00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.150
repository, you can contribute it
back with a different license.

91
00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:04.450
That's one of the beauties of it.

92
00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:08.250
Now we would encourage everyone to
contribute it back with another open

93
00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.570
license that allows people to contribute
and consume and contribute as well, right?

94
00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:13.658
But there are no limits and

95
00:05:13.658 --> 00:05:16.340
the repository is geared towards
hopefully helping everyone.

96
00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:20.100
So again, that's something
that we would look at, right?

97
00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:23.760
Experienced maintainers, and

98
00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.570
this goes right back into what John was
talking about with regards to how he's

99
00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.450
a software guy, but
maybe you want to get into hardware.

100
00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:32.580
Now, the people who
are maintaining this repository,

101
00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.410
which we are going to give credit
to in just a second, we have

102
00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:40.158
very experienced people that have been in
the hardware industry for a long time.

103
00:05:40.158 --> 00:05:44.930
One of our guys, Michael Welling, he's the
guy who's maintaining our kiCAD template.

104
00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:46.770
So if you have questions on kiCAD and

105
00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:50.630
you want to get into open source
computer aided drafting or

106
00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:55.500
computer aided design, then this is
the repository for you to start at.

107
00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:56.730
Everyone is very kind.

108
00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:58.170
Everyone is very helpful.

109
00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:02.403
You want to develop your first piece
of hardware, consume our template.

110
00:06:02.403 --> 00:06:04.935
Work with our repository,
with our maintainers.

111
00:06:04.935 --> 00:06:09.359
And boom there you go,
your first experiences is under your belt,

112
00:06:09.359 --> 00:06:11.418
add that to your resume [LAUGH].

113
00:06:11.418 --> 00:06:14.874
Very helpful community, so even though
someone might not be a maintainer,

114
00:06:14.874 --> 00:06:16.173
we have all these channels.

115
00:06:16.173 --> 00:06:19.245
And we touched on them kind of
in the resources video, but

116
00:06:19.245 --> 00:06:23.530
all these channels for people to kind
of interact and help each other out.

117
00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:26.700
A very engaging, very,
again, vibrant community.

118
00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.960
And, once again, it's a great entry point.

119
00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:32.130
So for those of you who have
zero hardware experience.

120
00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:36.270
For those of you who have
zero open source experience.

121
00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:38.370
We're not there to make fun of you.

122
00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:39.550
We're there to help you.

123
00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:42.280
Our maintainers are there to help you.

124
00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:47.490
We want to make sure that you learn and
have the best experience possible

125
00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:52.230
with your first open source contributions,
and this is a good place to do that.

126
00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:55.440
Not only,
I don't think I touched on it, but

127
00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:00.540
not only do we offer the ability to
submit issues on our repository,

128
00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:06.180
not only can you join us in our IRC
chat at #openhours or #96boards.

129
00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:11.090
But we have weekly video conference calls,
I mean you can join us me,

130
00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:15.730
Rajan, the maintainers of the repository,
you can join us all on a weekly basis and

131
00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:18.860
have fun with us and
learn about open source on weekly basis.

132
00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:20.680
So, great entry point for

133
00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:24.060
any of you who want to just kind of
continue on working in this world.

134
00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:28.170
Now I mentioned templates.

135
00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:30.340
We have currently three templates.

136
00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:32.620
If you are familiar with kiCAD, Altium or

137
00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:38.330
EagleCAD, you can consume our templates
and built a Mezzanine right off the bat.

138
00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:43.030
We've already confirmed the locations of
the high speed and low speed headers.

139
00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:45.700
In fact, this board right
here was one of the boards,

140
00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:48.650
I don't know if you can see that there,
but this right here was one of the boards

141
00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:51.720
that was built right out of
the Mezzanine Initiative.

142
00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:53.330
It's just a simple IO board.

143
00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:57.600
The main purpose was to test
that the high speed and

144
00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:01.360
the low speed header were
perfectly positioned to snap in

145
00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:05.350
to the dragging board 410C footprint,
the 96 points footprint.

146
00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:06.980
That came out of our Mezzanine initiative.

147
00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:09.870
So we've confirmed all
of our CAD templates.

148
00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:13.990
Consume, modify, contribute,
that's your path.

149
00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:18.460
Looking at the pipeline in the future,

150
00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:20.890
what kind of boards is this
initiative working on?

151
00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:25.779
You might think, newbies,
community people,

152
00:08:25.779 --> 00:08:32.540
they're working on nothing very complex,
but that's not true.

153
00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:36.360
Our people are working on
some very interesting things.

154
00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:39.820
Already, we have on
the docket GPS Mezzanine.

155
00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:45.410
A new, more complex compliance
version of the I/O testing Mezzanine.

156
00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:48.120
We're working on DSI touch displays.

157
00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:49.950
Possibly an RPi header,

158
00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:52.880
similar to what you saw in another
video with the arduino header.

159
00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:58.480
HiFi which is a high end audio mezzanine.

160
00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:02.070
LoWPAN 3G network, industrial

161
00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:08.250
neroban network mezzanines, and
then Remote Power Mezzanine.

162
00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:13.090
So I mean, allowing you to cycle
your 96Boards anywhere in the world.

163
00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:14.610
And the list goes on and on.

164
00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:18.551
Again, check out the repository to
find out more about this pipeline and

165
00:09:18.551 --> 00:09:20.177
contribute to the pipeline.

166
00:09:20.177 --> 00:09:23.930
If there is something you
want to see on there.

167
00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:27.040
Who are our contributors?

168
00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:30.930
Right now, and I know that this
video could at some point go stale.

169
00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:35.160
But right now our primary contributors are
the folks you see on the screen, I want to

170
00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:40.210
just make a shout out, Michael Welling,
Rafael Christ, and Gustavo Pinheiro.

171
00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:44.250
I'm not going to shout out to myself,

172
00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:45.820
Sahaj Sarup also.
>> I'll do that,

173
00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:48.220
shout out to Robert Wolff.
>> [LAUGH] Thank you.

174
00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:52.962
But yeah, so as you can see, you have a
lead maintainer who specializes in kiCAD,

175
00:09:52.962 --> 00:09:54.564
that's Michael Welling.

176
00:09:54.564 --> 00:09:58.387
You also have two other maintainers
that specialize in Altium and Eagle.

177
00:09:58.387 --> 00:10:02.223
So you want to work on this hardware, you
want to develop something that's usable,

178
00:10:02.223 --> 00:10:05.891
that's real, that's tangible, that you
can access and have some fun with,

179
00:10:05.891 --> 00:10:09.020
these guys are going to help you on
your path in the open source world.

180
00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:12.330
And we'll be there to help,
steer it forward.

181
00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:14.819
Again, there's a link to
the Mezzanine Community Initiative.

182
00:10:17.058 --> 00:10:18.630
How can you get involved?

183
00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:19.780
I kind of covered all that.

184
00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:20.615
>> Yeah.
>> Right.

185
00:10:20.615 --> 00:10:22.050
>> Mm-hm.

186
00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:24.300
>> Just reach out.

187
00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:28.680
Reach out, go to the Mezzanine repository,
reach out to us,

188
00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:31.380
open an issue, join us on IRC chat.

189
00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:34.490
We look forward to interacting
with you as much as possible.

190
00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:38.850
Join us during our open hours calls, join
us during our weekly Mezzanine meetings,

191
00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:41.150
and there you go,
that's how you get involved.

192
00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:42.727
We'll be there all the time.

193
00:10:45.132 --> 00:10:47.940
You want to wrap this one up?
>> Yeah, so like always,

194
00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:50.250
it's time to pause and replay.

195
00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:54.430
Let's take a look at some
resources that we have.

196
00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:57.450
In this section, we took a look at
the community initiative, right?

197
00:10:57.450 --> 00:10:59.180
So we have a couple of
resources on there for

198
00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:04.320
the community initiative GitHub,
that's on there.

199
00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:11.600
And like Robert said, go poke around,
go read up on the community initiative.

200
00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:14.470
Anybody who is getting started
with hardware design and

201
00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:17.600
just 96Boards Ecosystem,
it's a very good starting place for you.

202
00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.620
Yeah, we'll see you in the next video.

203
00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:22.220
I believe we are going to be
talking about verticals and

204
00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:25.140
how to create your path to product.
>> Yap.
