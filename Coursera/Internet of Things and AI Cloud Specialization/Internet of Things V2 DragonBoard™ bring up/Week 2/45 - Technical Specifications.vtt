1
00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:06.150
It's time to talk to you about
the technical specifications of

2
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:07.098
your DragonBoard 410C.

3
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.775
Throughout this lesson we've already kind
of talked about a lot of things we're

4
00:00:11.775 --> 00:00:14.560
gonna talk about right now, but
we want to give you a little bit more of

5
00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.799
an in depth look at
the capabilities of your board.

6
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.880
So, you have three options for

7
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.040
your operating system that
you wanna run on the board.

8
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.400
One of which is, of course, Android.

9
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.960
We've talked about that already.

10
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.850
Android being an application,
tablet based operating system.

11
00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.129
It's really nice for
application development.

12
00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.810
For all you Android users out there,
you'll have a lot of fun,

13
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.750
especially considering how
fast the processor is,

14
00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.360
which we're gonna talk
about in a second as well.

15
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.390
You have Linux, which is either a desktop,
or command line based operating system.

16
00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.392
Very similar to Windows or
Mac OS that you've probably seen before,

17
00:00:56.392 --> 00:01:02.517
and then we've heard that Windows 10 will
actually also be available for this port

18
00:01:02.517 --> 00:01:08.143
for download and installation, hopefully
sometime at the end of this year.

19
00:01:08.143 --> 00:01:10.242
So we look forward to that and

20
00:01:10.242 --> 00:01:15.496
we'll possibly be teaching you how
to do something with that later on.

21
00:01:15.496 --> 00:01:20.740
>> All right, and the processor is again,
is the Qualcomm SnapDragon processor.

22
00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.675
It is quad core and it's 1.2 Gigahertz,
which makes it incredibly fast for

23
00:01:25.675 --> 00:01:27.107
the use that it's in.

24
00:01:27.107 --> 00:01:29.538
It's not as fast as your computer,
but it's for

25
00:01:29.538 --> 00:01:31.684
a micro-controller it's just amazing.

26
00:01:31.684 --> 00:01:32.589
>> Oh yeah.

27
00:01:32.589 --> 00:01:35.453
>> It's 32-bit and 64-bit capable So

28
00:01:35.453 --> 00:01:40.620
you shouldn't have any problems with
video quality and things like that.

29
00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:41.650
There's a decent amount of RAM.

30
00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:48.860
So you have 1GB of RAM on board, and then
there's some small storage capabilities.

31
00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.109
I think you have like
8GB on the SanDisk and

32
00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:56.540
then you also have the,
like non volatile memory as well.

33
00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.106
>> Yeah so,
the eight gigabytes is basically

34
00:02:00.106 --> 00:02:04.463
where your operating system
is stored on board, and

35
00:02:04.463 --> 00:02:10.318
then you have access to the SD 3.0 for
a non-volatile disk memory.

36
00:02:10.318 --> 00:02:14.180
All right so, we'll talk a little
bit about video and graphics.

37
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:20.540
So you have the 1080p HD,
basically Video playback.

38
00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.300
So, 1080p is kind of,
it's pretty standard nowadays,

39
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.670
and this board's pushing it out there,
as well.

40
00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:34.210
The Qualcomm Adreno 306 40 graphics card,
we haven't

41
00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:39.110
had too much of a chance to experience
the graphical capabilities of this board.

42
00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.180
However, we're pretty sure they're gonna
be up there considering everything else

43
00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.180
we've experienced so
far with the speed of the processor.

44
00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:56.895
Connectivity and location, we talked to
you earlier about the on board GPS wi-fi,

45
00:02:56.895 --> 00:03:02.810
Bluetooth, everything that basically
connects you to the world [LAUGH].

46
00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:03.630
>> Yeah.

47
00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.990
>> Is on the board already so
that's awesome.

48
00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:07.176
>> [CROSSTALK] WiFi antennas,
you got it all so.

49
00:03:07.176 --> 00:03:11.493
>> Yeah, you got it all, it's all on
there, and from our experience so

50
00:03:11.493 --> 00:03:14.260
far it's phenomenal, it's really fast.

51
00:03:17.285 --> 00:03:20.395
Yeah, then we have a lot
of different IO interfaces.

52
00:03:20.395 --> 00:03:24.280
So you do again,
have the microSD card slot.

53
00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.375
This one has a full
size HDMI connector for

54
00:03:29.375 --> 00:03:33.460
connecting a wired to a display.

55
00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:34.485
>> There you go.

56
00:03:34.485 --> 00:03:38.498
>> Like a TV or something like that,
you have the micro USB, so

57
00:03:38.498 --> 00:03:42.530
that you can connect
an interface from a computer.

58
00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.008
This is really important for
Android again, uploading applications.

59
00:03:46.008 --> 00:03:50.050
You'll be probably using Android Studio or
Eclipse to build them on a computer and

60
00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.020
then upload them to the board.

61
00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:56.810
And you have the two USB slots,
again, that will be used for

62
00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.780
if you have Bluetooth or Windows operating
systems, you're probably gonna need

63
00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.270
a mouse and a keyboard to be able to write
programs directly on to the board and

64
00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:06.640
then be able run them from the terminal.

65
00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.270
>> Yeah, so actually talking about
basically uploading applications through

66
00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:14.190
the micro USB cable, that's been
the traditional way of doing things.

67
00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:19.260
This board, from what we've
gathered can also actually access

68
00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.160
the Android debug bridge via Bluetooth.

69
00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.560
So another cool reason why
the Bluetooth is built in here.

70
00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.090
We will hopefully be showing you how to do
that later on in this In this course, or

71
00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.870
the next course.

72
00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.270
But, a really cool feature that
just basically allows you to

73
00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:35.840
upload applications wirelessly.

74
00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.480
So, you could be sitting
around your house,

75
00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.505
throw an application on your
board from the living room.

76
00:04:39.505 --> 00:04:40.683
[LAUGH]
>> And

77
00:04:40.683 --> 00:04:41.750
we're back to the internet of things.

78
00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:42.491
[LAUGH]
>> And we're back

79
00:04:42.491 --> 00:04:43.148
to the internet of things.

80
00:04:43.148 --> 00:04:45.570
There you go.
Yeah.

81
00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:51.280
Camera support, so it is capable of
holding up to a 13 megapixel camera.

82
00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:56.930
Right now there is no camera for
this board however,

83
00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.210
they are going to be releasing one soon.

84
00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.670
And if you really needed a camera,

85
00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:05.770
you can hook up a USB camera
through one of the USB ports.

86
00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.190
So there still is access to video and
recording.

87
00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:14.120
Just not via the expansion headers yet.

88
00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:17.760
Talking about expansion headers,

89
00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:23.550
we have multiple ways to connect to
the world via these expansion headers.

90
00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.500
Like we talked about earlier, the 40 pin.

91
00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.410
>> Yeah, the 40 pin expansion header has
a whole lot of different options for

92
00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:33.270
connecting to various devices.

93
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:38.260
You have the UR, the SPI,
the I2C, the GPIO, those are a lot

94
00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:42.960
of the big important ones, we're gonna go
over those a lot in more detail, I think

95
00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.620
in course 3, but it's very important to
note that these are gonna be available for

96
00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:52.420
the DragonBoard,
>> Yeah, and then on the 60 pin header as

97
00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:57.669
you can see up there, you have
access to more I2C, MIPI where you

98
00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:03.705
can possibly build yourself a audio
system, or something of those sorts.

99
00:06:03.705 --> 00:06:08.363
Definitely a lot of really cool
capabilities in the future when after

100
00:06:08.363 --> 00:06:11.022
developing more stuff for this board.

101
00:06:11.022 --> 00:06:11.811
>> Yeah.

102
00:06:11.811 --> 00:06:17.022
>> Yeah, oh yeah, and of course,
the 16 pin hair, we already talked about

103
00:06:17.022 --> 00:06:21.904
all of this in an earlier video, but
yeah the 16 pin expansion header

104
00:06:21.904 --> 00:06:26.740
as well has audio capabilities where
you can maybe solder in a jack.

105
00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:30.050
It has microphone capabilities and
stuff like that.

106
00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:34.618
Since this is a 96 board's,
compatible board,

107
00:06:34.618 --> 00:06:40.370
there will be other add on's available,
like we talked about.

108
00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:46.070
So possible shields that will allow
you to use third party cameras,

109
00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:47.550
and stuff like that.

110
00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:52.170
So, look forward or look,
yeah look forward to seeing,

111
00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:57.260
look forward to seeing more releases for
this board, because it was just released

112
00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.910
very, not too long ago, and
there's a lot more coming out.

113
00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:00.760
>> Within the last month or so.

114
00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:03.382
>> Oh yeah, yeah.
There's going to be a lot more coming out

115
00:07:03.382 --> 00:07:04.897
for it, so we're excited.
