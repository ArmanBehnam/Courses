1
00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:06.910
I think it's time to talk about the board
and all of the components on the board.

2
00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.860
Kinda getting you familiarized
like we promised earlier.

3
00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:11.140
With everything on there.

4
00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.624
>> We want to get chance you just kinda
point out where everything is on the board

5
00:00:14.624 --> 00:00:17.190
so you can see where it's at and
get a kind of feel for it.

6
00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:19.480
>> Alright.

7
00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.560
>> First off, we have
the Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 processor.

8
00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:29.780
This is the shining star of the Dragon
board because it's the brain of the board.

9
00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.390
>> I like what you did there.

10
00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.710
>> I got really excited because I've used
other boards in the past and there's so

11
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.528
many problems with having lots of lag and
glitching and

12
00:00:41.528 --> 00:00:45.420
trying to move around and
it kind of jumps around awkwardly.

13
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.928
But we don't have any kinds of
those problems using this board so

14
00:00:47.928 --> 00:00:49.100
it's been really exciting.

15
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.777
>> Oh, so you have to see it for yourself.

16
00:00:52.777 --> 00:00:57.000
>> [LAUGH]
>> But there is one gigabyte of RAM

17
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.750
on board, and there's also
a little slot to be able to put in

18
00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.630
a micro SD card and so
there's a lot of options with that.

19
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.390
>> I'd actually like to
talk about that real quick.

20
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:09.900
We have experience with other boards,

21
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.830
like the SD card slot can't be used for
anything.

22
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.950
You're either running your operating
system off it, you're running boot disks

23
00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.890
off of it, you're running a boot
file off of it or an image.

24
00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:26.320
With this board, you can not only boot
an operating system or flash an operating

25
00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.290
system onto the board, you can also use
the micro SD card as extra storage space.

26
00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.110
At least a few of the boards that I've
had experience with you can't do that.

27
00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.220
So that's a really cool feature
about the micro SD card slot.

28
00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.100
>> Yeah, and
also one of the most exciting things for

29
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.560
me was that if you look you
can see that there is wireless

30
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.080
internet, GPS and
Bluetooth all built into the board, and

31
00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.530
I have never seen another one that had all
three of them already pre-installed and

32
00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.910
that comes with it so
it's been really exciting.

33
00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.880
Again the Micro SD slot and
there's different dip switches so

34
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.570
you control how to boot from the card or
not, and

35
00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.130
so you can use that to be able to install
different operating systems on the board.

36
00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.750
There are two USB ports.

37
00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.960
We haven't found a much need to
have more than that because again,

38
00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.490
no extra dongles to plug in WiFi,
no extra dongles to plug in Bluetooth,

39
00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.010
don't have to deal with that,
just got a mouse and a keyboard and

40
00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.660
also keyboards available that have
a little touch pad included so

41
00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.840
it hasn't been a problem at all.

42
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.190
Now, there is a micro USB port.

43
00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.610
This is to connect to a computer.

44
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.820
It does not work at the same time as
the mouse and the keyboard, but then,

45
00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.040
you don't need the mouse and the keyboard
if you're connected to a computer.

46
00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.830
So, again, no problem there.

47
00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:47.480
Yeah.

48
00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.330
>> Another cool thing about that is

49
00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.950
you have basically a PC host to
manipulate aspects of the board.

50
00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:55.756
So-
>> Connect through a terminal.

51
00:02:55.756 --> 00:02:56.670
>> Connect through a terminal.

52
00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.430
Do all sorts of cool things through there.

53
00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.000
In fact that's how you're gonna be
importing your applications from Android

54
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.050
studio onto the board.

55
00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.766
Yeah.
>> Yeah I guess that's important to note

56
00:03:07.766 --> 00:03:10.380
that if you're more Android you'll
probably use the micro USB and

57
00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.400
if you're more Ubuntu
you'd use the USB slots.

58
00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.950
>> Yeah, so
as you can see up there, number 7,

59
00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.450
also the 40 pin expansion header which
is the low speed expansion header.

60
00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.250
That's where you're gonna find
all of the GPIO interfaces,

61
00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.570
especially the ones that we're
gonna be using for this course, and

62
00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.120
we're gonna talk to you way more
in detail about all that later on.

63
00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.990
>> Yeah, I take it back.

64
00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.341
This is one of the most
exciting things in the course.

65
00:03:36.341 --> 00:03:37.178
[LAUGH]
>> Yeah.

66
00:03:37.178 --> 00:03:38.466
>> There's so many things.

67
00:03:38.466 --> 00:03:42.201
>> For this course, this is gonna be
one of the things we're gonna be using

68
00:03:42.201 --> 00:03:43.660
the most, at least for course three.

69
00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.100
But, yeah, definitely.

70
00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.200
We have a 16 pin analog expansion header,

71
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.400
which is located right next to
the 40 pin expansion header.

72
00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.190
On this header you have access to audio,
you have access to

73
00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:02.061
microphone jacks, so essentially
you're able to solder in a 3.5,

74
00:04:02.061 --> 00:04:05.340
for example, 3.5 millimeter audio jack and

75
00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:11.230
plug in some speakers or
solder on a jack for a microphone.

76
00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.160
There's lots of other
interesting things on there.

77
00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.950
We won't go too much into detail
in this course but just so

78
00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:21.160
you know it is there and there's plenty
of documentation on this header.

79
00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:26.330
We have a 60-pin, high speed
header which is gonna be used for

80
00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.110
a lot of other things that we
won't be covering in this course.

81
00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.130
Possibly in later courses, but
just so you know it's there and

82
00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.840
there again is a lot of
documentation on this header.

83
00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:40.720
You have the power button right there,
you can see the power symbol there.

84
00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.510
Pretty straightforward, but you're
gonna be using that mostly for Android,

85
00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:46.560
powering off your board on Android.

86
00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.630
You most likely won't be touching
it when you're running the Ubuntu.

87
00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.280
>> Yeah there's shut down menus on Ubuntu.

88
00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:57.040
>> When you picture your cell phone, you
picture, you have your sleep/power button,

89
00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.300
you have your volume buttons, which are
located right next to the power button and

90
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.340
that's mainly what that's gonna be for
on Android.

91
00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.360
The minus button is used later on for

92
00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.200
booting into fast boot, but
you'll be taught how to do that later.

93
00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.850
The DC barrel jack,
basically how you power your board.

94
00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:16.932
Pretty self explanatory.

95
00:05:16.932 --> 00:05:22.510
You're gonna need to stick
between a 6.5 volt and

96
00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:27.010
a 18 volt DC power supply, or

97
00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:30.600
power adapter and two amps.

98
00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:36.735
So you can find all that information
in the spec sheets for the board.

99
00:05:36.735 --> 00:05:40.140
But you definitely want to
make sure you look at that so

100
00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:43.560
that you don't burn out your board by
plugging in too high of a voltage.

101
00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.800
>> Yeah.
>> So stick between 6.5 and 18.

102
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.280
>> The nice thing here, though,
is it has a lot higher voltage than most

103
00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.510
boards customly have,
cuz if I took an 18 volt adapter and

104
00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:55.040
plugged it into something else,
it would probably burn it out.

105
00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.210
>> Oh yeah, no, we've actually done that.

106
00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:57.204
So, yeah [LAUGH].

107
00:05:57.204 --> 00:05:58.355
Yeah.
>> [LAUGH] Well,

108
00:05:58.355 --> 00:05:59.755
this one's a bit safer so [LAUGH].

109
00:05:59.755 --> 00:06:03.105
>> Yeah, and definitely being able
to put higher voltages in there.

110
00:06:03.105 --> 00:06:05.845
>> Plus it's nice cuz then
you get a high voltage

111
00:06:05.845 --> 00:06:09.275
power rail out of the 40 pin expansion
header which can be very useful if you're

112
00:06:09.275 --> 00:06:10.735
running certain things like-
>> Oh yeah,

113
00:06:10.735 --> 00:06:12.015
we're gonna actually talk about that.

114
00:06:12.015 --> 00:06:15.605
So sometimes you might need to run
a really high voltage to power

115
00:06:15.605 --> 00:06:16.650
a certain device.

116
00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:20.190
This board's already got that, so
no need for batteries or extra adapters.

117
00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:22.500
>> Yeah.
For example, powering a motor.

118
00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:23.580
>> Oh, yeah.

119
00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:24.140
>> Yeah.

120
00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:25.700
>> Yeah, and then last but
not least, the HDMI port.

121
00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:27.280
It's how you're gonna
see everything right?

122
00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.900
So, a full sized HDMI,
two HDMI, really cool.

123
00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:35.629
So, yeah, there's your board,
at least, some of the main components.

124
00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:38.698
I'd recommend looking at it and
kind of getting familiar with it.
