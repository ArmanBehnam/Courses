00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:03.099
In this video,

2
00:00:03.099 --> 00:00:06.980
we're going to talk about the onboard
expansion connectors on the DragonBoard.

3
00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:14.840
As an overview, the DragonBoard
contains several expansion connectors,

4
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:21.630
a high speed and low speed connector which
conform to a 96 board specification.

5
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.520
And the pin notes for those connectors

6
00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.380
are different when viewed from the Android
software or the Linux Debian software.

7
00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.850
The DragonBoard also contains
an analog expansion connector which is

8
00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.470
unique to the DragonBoard and not
available on other 96 board form factor.

9
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.280
This analog expansion is really useful for
adding microphones and

10
00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.840
speakers so
that you can give audio to your projects.

11
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.880
So now, we'll delve a little deeper
into the low speed connector and

12
00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.195
then the high-speed connector.

13
00:00:57.195 --> 00:00:58.755
This is the pin out for

14
00:00:58.755 --> 00:01:03.880
the low speed connector as you find
in the 96 boards specification.

15
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.190
Not all of these groups of pins will
make sense to you at first, but

16
00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.580
as you progress,
they will make more sense.

17
00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.640
So I'm going to start at the upper
left and work my way down and

18
00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.870
then on the upper right and work my
way down through the groups of pins.

19
00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.060
And talk a little bit about
what each group does.

20
00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.410
So, the first group is
the UART connections.

21
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:34.100
So this is the Universal Asynchronous
Receiver Transmitter or UART.

22
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.880
Typically used for communications with
terminals, low speed peripherals.

23
00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.380
Speeds between as slow
as 300 bits per second

24
00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.590
up to little over a 100
kilobits per second.

25
00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:56.010
So, not nearly as fast as USB,
but a very universal connection.

26
00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.790
There are two UART ports on the board.

27
00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.320
UART0 is what they call
a four-pin UART port.

28
00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.750
So it has a transmit data, a receive data,
and two handshaking signals,

29
00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.859
the request to send and
clear to send handshaking signals.

30
00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:18.080
This is where the peripheral tells the
board that it has something to send and

31
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.670
the board tells the peripheral that yes,
you can go ahead and

32
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.000
send it with the clear to send.

33
00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.276
The second UART port is only two-pins.

34
00:02:28.276 --> 00:02:32.200
It's assumed to always be
ready to send and transmit.

35
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.078
So we removed the request to send and
clear to send pins.

36
00:02:35.078 --> 00:02:39.490
The second UART port

37
00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.430
is nearly always used as the serial
console to the operating system.

38
00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.420
So this is very useful when you're
bringing up an operating system to find

39
00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.820
out if anything is alive because
is the most, the simplest.

40
00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.716
The most universal peripheral available
on all computers is a simple UART port.

41
00:02:58.716 --> 00:03:01.746
[COUGH] Excuse me.

42
00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:10.020
The next group of pins is the I2C port.

43
00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:17.271
This is a specification that is useful for
connecting multiple peripherals to.

44
00:03:17.271 --> 00:03:23.556
And you'll find many low speed
peripherals such as accelerometers,

45
00:03:23.556 --> 00:03:27.605
gyros, light sensors, simple keyboards,

46
00:03:27.605 --> 00:03:32.625
touch pads,
touch screens that all connect with I2C.

47
00:03:32.625 --> 00:03:37.247
The I2C ports run typical at
10 kilobytes per second up to

48
00:03:37.247 --> 00:03:40.213
about a 100 kilobytes per second.

49
00:03:40.213 --> 00:03:43.929
So it's in the same speed
range as the UART ports, but

50
00:03:43.929 --> 00:03:46.250
the protocol is very different.

51
00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:54.037
As you progress through building projects
you'll find many I2C peripherals that you

52
00:03:54.037 --> 00:03:59.194
can buy and attach to this board, and they
all connect through these two connections.

53
00:04:01.032 --> 00:04:07.209
The next group of pins is what we call
GPIO or General Purpose Input/Output pins.

54
00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:13.620
These pins can be configured as in input
to read a simple device, like a switch.

55
00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.930
Or an output,
to control a simple device like an LED.

56
00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.110
Or you can use groups of GPIOs
to control multiple switches,

57
00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:27.170
multiple LEDs, and
build more complex peripherals.

58
00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:30.930
Typically the speed of
things connected to GPIO

59
00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:36.230
is in the 1 to maybe
100 actions per second.

60
00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:40.730
Rarely much more that this because it
is completely software controlled and

61
00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.186
the software requires time to
get around to doing things.

62
00:04:46.672 --> 00:04:50.346
The next group of pins is
the power supply pins.

63
00:04:50.346 --> 00:04:55.310
These power supplies, 1.8 volts and
5 volts with respect to

64
00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:00.420
ground are provided by
the DragonBoard to your peripherals.

65
00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:05.550
This allows you to power up things
that you have attached to the other

66
00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:06.618
ports on the board.

67
00:05:06.618 --> 00:05:10.824
Typically the 1.8 volts supply is used for

68
00:05:10.824 --> 00:05:16.700
an I/O voltage and 5 volt is used for
more significant power.

69
00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.160
Starting down the right
hand side of the column,

70
00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.700
we see in the upper right,
the I can't see it either.

71
00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:28.600
Give me a moment, which port is that,

72
00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:29.925
Robert?
>> Power button,

73
00:05:29.925 --> 00:05:33.240
reset button?
>> Okay, I'll back up a bit.

74
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.580
The next group of pins in the upper right
is the power button and the reset button.

75
00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.870
When you look at the DragonBoard,
you will see that there is a physical

76
00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:47.110
power button and
reset button on the board.

77
00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:51.870
But When you attach a mezzanine
board on top of the DragonBoard,

78
00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:53.640
you can't physically reach them.

79
00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.200
So what we've done is we've
brought the signals for

80
00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:00.610
the power button and the reset
button up to the mezzanine board.

81
00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:04.366
And designers of mezzanine boards
can put an additional power and

82
00:06:04.366 --> 00:06:06.081
reset button on their board.

83
00:06:08.535 --> 00:06:11.550
This group of pins is the SPI pins.

84
00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:14.120
This is a serial peripheral interface.

85
00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.760
It is very similar to UART and
I2C, but it is yet

86
00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:22.500
another protocol in which
the data going out and

87
00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:27.250
the data coming back are separated and
there is also a clock signal.

88
00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:32.140
To tell the peripheral when to receive
each bit of data and that there

89
00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:37.810
is a chip select signal to select
the chip that you've attached externally.

90
00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:41.430
So this is yet another low speed
protocol typically used for

91
00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:48.170
devices in the one megabit per second
to 40 megabits per second range.

92
00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:49.550
But it can run slower and

93
00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:51.840
it can run slightly faster
depending on your peripheral.

94
00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:57.850
You'll actually see some of the mezzanine
boards that are available actually using

95
00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:00.756
this, four things like
analog to digital converters

96
00:07:04.257 --> 00:07:09.213
This group of pins is the pulse
coded modulation or PCM pins.

97
00:07:09.213 --> 00:07:15.127
This is typically used for
audio codex, microphones, speakers,

98
00:07:15.127 --> 00:07:20.120
and similar peripherals that
transmit audio in and out.

99
00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:26.040
Finally, we have the system DCIN pins.

100
00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:31.286
These pins are an exact copy of the pins
that are on the power connector,

101
00:07:31.286 --> 00:07:33.740
down in this corner of the board.

102
00:07:36.005 --> 00:07:40.314
Normally, if you connect the power
connector to the board then

103
00:07:40.314 --> 00:07:42.834
SYS_DCIN would be used to power your

104
00:07:42.834 --> 00:07:48.360
devices on your Mezzanine board that
you've brought above the board.

105
00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:52.870
But there is also a possibility
of using SYS_DCIN to

106
00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:55.530
take power down to the DragonBoard.

107
00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:58.400
If you do this then you don't need
to connect an external power supply.

108
00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:04.620
This is a level of detail that
will require some design work, and

109
00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:08.830
it will be particularly useful if you
are designing a battery mezzanine board so

110
00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:11.160
that you could build a stand along system.

111
00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:12.300
For instance in a drone.

112
00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:18.660
Moving on from the low speed connector,
let's talk about the high speed connector.

113
00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:24.180
The high speed connector is this white
connector on the board with 60 pins.

114
00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:28.400
This gives you access to much higher speed

115
00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.600
interfaces than we had on
the low speed connector.

116
00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:34.520
So the first high speed interface we have,

117
00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:38.110
this group of pins can
be used as an SD card.

118
00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:43.180
So you could put a second SD card
slot on a mezzanine board and

119
00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:46.310
have access to two SD
cards at the same time.

120
00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:49.860
The set of pins also
has dual functionality.

121
00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:55.010
It can also be used as another SPI port,

122
00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:59.410
so you can connect another SPI
device to this group of Pins.

123
00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:04.830
Which set of pins you get is dependent
upon the manufacturer of the board.

124
00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:07.880
So not all 96Boards will be the same.

125
00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:18.960
Some will have SPI, some will have SDIO,
and others may have neither of those.

126
00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:19.848
They are all optional.

127
00:09:22.837 --> 00:09:26.840
This group of pins is the MIPI CSI port.

128
00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:31.200
The clock for the port is on the left and
the MIPI CSI,

129
00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:36.615
which is the camera standard interface,
is very high speed port.

130
00:09:36.615 --> 00:09:43.558
The four lanes of MIPI CSI each run
at over a gigabit per second and

131
00:09:43.558 --> 00:09:48.058
when combined you have over four gigabits

132
00:09:48.058 --> 00:09:53.260
per second of data coming from the camera.

133
00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.223
This is a very high speed interface, and

134
00:09:55.223 --> 00:09:59.230
requires very careful attention to signal
layout when building a mezzanine board

135
00:10:02.519 --> 00:10:06.670
This group of signals is
the second MIPI CSI port.

136
00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:08.870
This port only has two lanes of data, and

137
00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:11.770
one lane of clock along
with a master clock.

138
00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:15.940
So, it's for smaller cameras
typically five mega pixels and below.

139
00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:21.893
But again, is two gigabits per
second combined on the two lanes

140
00:10:25.138 --> 00:10:31.360
This group of pins is the MIPI DSI port,
which is the display standard interface.

141
00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:36.660
This allows you to connect a LCD
display or an OLED display.

142
00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:41.209
And each lane in the MIPI DSI runs
at over a gigabit per second, so

143
00:10:41.209 --> 00:10:45.262
you can refresh even very
large displays quite quickly.

144
00:10:47.903 --> 00:10:52.000
Finally, we've come down to the USB port.

145
00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:58.286
This is the secondary USB port, so if you
need a third USB port in your system,

146
00:10:58.286 --> 00:11:03.436
nearly all 96 Boards implement
a extra USB port on this lane.

147
00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:08.500
This is an alternate form of USB port.

148
00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:15.234
It's intended for devices that are
connected directly and not using a cable.

149
00:11:15.234 --> 00:11:20.470
So this is HSIC, or
the High Speed InterChip USB.

150
00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:26.770
These ports are 480 megabits
per second and very useful for

151
00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:30.080
attaching embedded peripherals
on your mezzanine board.

152
00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:32.998
For instance,
a USB hub chip would attach here easily.

153
00:11:35.089 --> 00:11:40.660
Finally, we have two more I2C ports.

154
00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:45.160
Usually this I2C ports are used for
the two cameras to control things like

155
00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:50.330
the auto focus motor to keep the cameras
focused on the right object.

156
00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:53.490
But they can be used as
general purpose I2C ports and

157
00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:55.560
connect more I2C peripherals.

158
00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:59.750
This completes our walk through
of the high speed connector.

159
00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:09.018
Next I'm going to cover the,
can I have slide back, [LAUGH].

160
00:12:09.018 --> 00:12:13.380
This slide presents the low
speed connector in a much more

161
00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:16.830
visually clear form.

162
00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:21.730
One of things you will notice is
the numbers of the GPIOs on the left and

163
00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:25.630
the numbers of the GPIOs
on the right are different.

164
00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:30.290
This is because the two major operating
systems on the board, Android and

165
00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:35.040
Linux, use different representations for
the pins.

166
00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:39.500
So Android uses numbers
that are based above 902.

167
00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:45.619
Whereas Linux or Debian uses numbers
that are based just above 1.

168
00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:51.758
This is for your reference only and makes
it easier to understand what numbers you

169
00:12:51.758 --> 00:12:55.086
should be using when you're
attempting to access GPIOs.

170
00:12:58.051 --> 00:13:03.442
Here's a more visual representation
of the 410 Low-Speed pin out.

171
00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:07.700
As you can see,
some of the blocks are grayed-out.

172
00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:12.180
These blocks are called reserved on
this board, it's because the DragonBoard

173
00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:16.680
410 does not implement those optional
features of the low speed connector.

174
00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:22.600
But the important features of the low
speed connectors, the GPIOs, UARTs, and

175
00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:27.260
I2C are all implemented and
available for your use.

176
00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:31.640
The next section we're going to cover
is the analog expansion connector.

177
00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:34.480
The analog expansion
connector in the DragonBoard,

178
00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:39.950
allows connections of speakers,
headphones, stereo headphones,

179
00:13:39.950 --> 00:13:44.939
microphones, and an FM antenna for
receiving FM signals.

180
00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:51.880
These are expansions beyond
the 96 Boards spec but

181
00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:55.160
things that we felt,
you would find very useful.

182
00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:57.700
There is an application
note called the stereo

183
00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:02.120
connector application note available
from developer.qualcomm.com.

184
00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:03.360
That gives you the details and

185
00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:08.030
it gives you sample circuits of connecting
things to this expansion connector.

186
00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:13.110
Hopefully this will incite you to
new ideas of things you can do with

187
00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:18.210
the DragonBoard now that you have analog
audio input and output capability.

188
00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:22.060
The analog expansion connector is
explained in much more detail in

189
00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:28.120
the stereo connector application note
available on developer.qualcomm.com.

190
00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:30.280
This isn't a link
directly to the App Note,

191
00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:34.140
you will have to navigate your way
through the system and find the App Note.

192
00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:37.820
It's along with all of the other
App Notes on this board.

193
00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:40.750
Finally, as usual, we have the resources.

194
00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:45.203
The Qualcomm Developer Network,
the 96Boards Specification page,

195
00:14:45.203 --> 00:14:47.247
and the 96Boards GitHub page.

196
00:14:49.759 --> 00:14:52.227
Hopefully this will inspire
you to build new and

197
00:14:52.227 --> 00:14:54.270
better things using the DragonBoard.
