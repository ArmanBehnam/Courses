00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:04.393
As promised, now we're going to talk
about the out of box experience for

2
00:00:04.393 --> 00:00:05.798
your Dragonboard 410c.

3
00:00:05.798 --> 00:00:08.670
And as you can see we have our
boards right here, our boxes.

4
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.960
And by the end of this video, we will have
unboxed them to show you how it goes.

5
00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.540
But before we go into this whole unboxing
experience, we kind of want to talk about

6
00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:21.140
your experience when trying
to buy a DragonBoard.

7
00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.910
Now, what you're going to run into when
you start searching the internet for

8
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.030
a DragonBoard 410c, you're going to
run into all these different kits.

9
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:31.460
Now, how do you kind of decipher what
you want out of your DragonBoard 410c.

10
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.660
>> And that will really depend on what
you are actually trying to do with

11
00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:36.250
the DragonBoard.

12
00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.031
So the type of application
you were trying to develop,

13
00:00:39.031 --> 00:00:41.993
whether you were trying to do
an IoT based application, or

14
00:00:41.993 --> 00:00:45.634
an audio based application, or
a computer vision based application.

15
00:00:45.634 --> 00:00:49.694
There's all of these different kits which
are available to you on all of these

16
00:00:49.694 --> 00:00:53.708
different websites that you can pick and
choose based on your application.

17
00:00:53.708 --> 00:00:57.035
>> So one of the first steps you want to
take when kind of deciphering what you

18
00:00:57.035 --> 00:00:59.976
want out of your DragonBoard is
probably like what Rajan said,

19
00:00:59.976 --> 00:01:02.380
is thinking about what
you're trying to develop.

20
00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.220
But you can also go explore either your
search engine, searching around for

21
00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.480
DragonBoard 410c ideas, but you can
also visit the 96Boards.org website and

22
00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.110
go to the DragonBoard 410c landing page.

23
00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.120
And you can read about
all of these kits there.

24
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.680
So, on that page there's
all of these options for

25
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.020
the different kits that
are listed on this list.

26
00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.711
Now, for the purpose of this video, we're
going to walk through each one of these

27
00:01:24.711 --> 00:01:26.985
kits and
kind of explain why each one is special.

28
00:01:29.261 --> 00:01:31.000
So this is the first kit,
the basic kit and

29
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.415
this is the one we actually
have on the table here.

30
00:01:33.415 --> 00:01:37.115
Now what's special about this kit,
is that it comes with the DragonBoard 410c

31
00:01:37.115 --> 00:01:41.995
on it's own and it comes preflashed
with Android Operating System on it.

32
00:01:41.995 --> 00:01:43.410
Now, for

33
00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.640
someone who's interested in developing
Android, this might be the kit for you.

34
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.140
If you already have a power
supply geared up for

35
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.130
your DragonBoard 410c,
this might be the kit for you.

36
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.560
Other than that,
this is the most basic one.

37
00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.510
It's available on arrow.com.

38
00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:58.634
And you can go get that right now.

39
00:01:58.634 --> 00:02:00.330
It's usually very widely available.

40
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:01.804
>> Mm-hm.

41
00:02:01.804 --> 00:02:06.840
>> The Amazon IoT kit is special because
it comes with a power supply included,

42
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.740
and you can get it on Amazon.

43
00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.018
As far as I know,
it's actually available on Amazon Prime.

44
00:02:11.018 --> 00:02:11.750
>> Yeah.

45
00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.030
>> Yeah, so if you're in the U.S.,

46
00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.110
I believe you can get it delivered
to your house within two days.

47
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.800
Very nice.

48
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.200
And also,
another fun thing about this one,

49
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.133
is that it comes preflashed with
the Debian Operating System, correct?

50
00:02:23.133 --> 00:02:24.780
>> Mm-hm.

51
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.826
>> Great, the audio kit is a nifty
little kit available through Arrow,

52
00:02:29.826 --> 00:02:34.265
that you can actually have
a mezzanine included in your kit.

53
00:02:34.265 --> 00:02:38.364
So not only do you get the DragonBoard
410c, you get your power supply, but

54
00:02:38.364 --> 00:02:40.990
you also get a nice little
audio mezzanine board.

55
00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.860
Now, we haven't really
talked about mezzanines yet,

56
00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.340
but these are very special,
extra additional boards

57
00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.060
that compliment the features of
your DragonBoard 410c experience.

58
00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.490
We'll get more in depth on this later.

59
00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:54.063
>> Later, yeah.

60
00:02:54.063 --> 00:02:54.563
>> Yeah.

61
00:02:56.326 --> 00:02:58.870
The camera kit is another very cool kit.

62
00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.630
And as Rajan was pointing out earlier,

63
00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.070
depending on what you're trying to
develop, this might be the kit for you.

64
00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:08.950
Because it has a mezzanine board
that basically focuses on camera

65
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.360
features, right?

66
00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.571
Yeah, it comes with a DragonBoard,
it comes with the power adaptor and

67
00:03:15.571 --> 00:03:18.604
it comes with a D3 design
core engineering board.

68
00:03:18.604 --> 00:03:22.243
And if you search YouTube, you can
actually find some videos from Rajan and

69
00:03:22.243 --> 00:03:23.933
I doing the unboxing experience.

70
00:03:23.933 --> 00:03:25.013
>> Unboxing from the D3, yeah.

71
00:03:25.013 --> 00:03:26.980
>> Yeah, some fun videos there.

72
00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.380
We did a two parter or a three parter.

73
00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.880
>> Yeah.

74
00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.250
>> Great, now what kits are next?

75
00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.140
We don't know, right?

76
00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.452
But this is a great opportunity for

77
00:03:36.452 --> 00:03:41.230
you to think about either what
kits you would need in the future?

78
00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.880
And so you can start kind of
maybe pinging the community.

79
00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.940
Figuring out what kind of kits would
be good for your development process.

80
00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.520
Talk to Rajan and I through any forums.

81
00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:54.224
And also, keep an eye on the 96Boards and
our DragonBoard 410c website, so

82
00:03:54.224 --> 00:03:58.512
that you can see if any other kits become
available that would cater to your

83
00:03:58.512 --> 00:03:59.780
development needs.

84
00:04:02.322 --> 00:04:03.436
So as we've mentioned,

85
00:04:03.436 --> 00:04:06.518
some of this boards come flashed
with different operating systems.

86
00:04:06.518 --> 00:04:11.309
But don't be scared about that because the
DragonBoard ecosystem is very large and

87
00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:15.005
the software that is in heart,
that has already been enabled for

88
00:04:15.005 --> 00:04:18.163
this board,
is available through various channels.

89
00:04:18.163 --> 00:04:24.161
Now you can see on there, Android,
Fedora, Debian, Linaro based Debian,

90
00:04:24.161 --> 00:04:29.529
OpenEmbedded, Canonicals,
Ubuntu Core, Windows 10 IoT Core.

91
00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:33.955
>> And a lot of different operating
systems that you see on the slides

92
00:04:33.955 --> 00:04:34.770
over here.

93
00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.040
Just like the kits, depending on the type
of application you are trying to do.

94
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.400
You might want to select
one versus the other.

95
00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.260
Each operating system has its own pros and
cons.

96
00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:49.420
For example, Ubuntu Core, it has
a very good snappy-based system where

97
00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:51.320
it's easier for you to manage deployment.

98
00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.260
It's very straightforward.

99
00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.880
Debian, on the other hand,
is a desktop-based environment.

100
00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:00.720
So somebody who is picking this up for
the first time, it's very easy for

101
00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.050
them to come up to speed
on a DragonBoard and

102
00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.960
an embedded environment with
a Debian based operating system.

103
00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:12.394
Windows 10 has it's own pros and cons,
and right of course, more geared

104
00:05:12.394 --> 00:05:17.756
towards cellphone type of usage, so
each one has it's own pros and cons.

105
00:05:17.756 --> 00:05:22.114
We really encourage you guys to go and
do some more research based on the type of

106
00:05:22.114 --> 00:05:25.954
applications and develop and
work that you guys are planning to do.

107
00:05:25.954 --> 00:05:29.209
>> Basically what we're saying here
is just because your board shipped

108
00:05:29.209 --> 00:05:31.173
with the operating system on it already,

109
00:05:31.173 --> 00:05:34.110
doesn't mean you can't
change it to what you want.

110
00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:37.920
So visit the website, the DragonBoard
landing page on 96Boards, and

111
00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.860
you can change it to any
operating system you want.

112
00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:41.270
There's instructions, downloads.

113
00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:42.910
Everything is available to you.

114
00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:44.620
Your resources are there.

115
00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:48.220
Also I want to add something
that's not on this slide.

116
00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.790
But openSUSE is also another
operating system that's available for

117
00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:52.910
the DragonBoard.

118
00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:54.350
And there are more to come.

119
00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:56.470
There are also other ones out there
that we might not be aware of.

120
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:02.690
Great, now before we unbox this,
even though we will not be following

121
00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:05.842
a lot of these safety tips-
>> Because our kit didn't come

122
00:06:05.842 --> 00:06:08.250
with a power supply so
we are not going to turn it on.

123
00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:12.640
So that's why we are not going to use
the ESD mats and safety precaution tips.

124
00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:16.020
>> Yeah, but, for
those of you at home watching this,

125
00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:20.380
you might want to entertain getting
some of these safety tools.

126
00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:23.190
So you can see here we have a ESD mat.

127
00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:26.100
This is something nifty for
putting your DragonBoard down on.

128
00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:29.267
Yeah, well, you kind of put this
little wrist band, it grounds you,

129
00:06:29.267 --> 00:06:32.950
it basically gives you a nice little
work space there for your DragonBoard.

130
00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:34.240
You have ESD gloves.

131
00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.830
Allows you to kind of fiddle around with
it without leaving any unwanted grease

132
00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:39.220
from your fingers on the board.

133
00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:41.840
Which then when you power
it on could cause shorts.

134
00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.500
ESD bags, good places to store your board.

135
00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:47.990
You want to make sure that you check the
resistivity, the resistance on the bags,

136
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:53.030
make sure that it complements
the DragonBoard's chip sets or circuits.

137
00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:54.170
And then ESD foam.

138
00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:56.250
So, there's lots of options you have.

139
00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:59.230
This is a list of some things that you
might want to do some research on and

140
00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:02.440
see if it fits your needs.

141
00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:06.000
To make that your DragonBoard stays safe.

142
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.120
Now moving on, it's time, we're
going to open up our DragonBoard 410c.

143
00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:15.920
Rajan here is going to kind of go
through the process, and hopefully-

144
00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:17.890
>> So I'm going to unbox this box and

145
00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:21.560
we're going to have a conversation
around what is in the box.

146
00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:26.134
And we're going to see
the DragonBoard in this.

147
00:07:26.134 --> 00:07:30.600
>> Great, so yeah, as Rajan mentioned,
this is the basic kit.

148
00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:34.440
And you can tell that it's
the basic kit because of it's size.

149
00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:37.320
Other DragonBoard boxes
are slightly bigger.

150
00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:39.420
But yeah, this is the basic kit.

151
00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:42.560
>> So let's go ahead and
open the box and you can see.

152
00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:50.400
Put this on the side and there's a little
Let's Play DragonBoard kind of pamphlet.

153
00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:56.990
It has like a description of
what the connectors are and

154
00:07:56.990 --> 00:08:01.460
I think this is more towards the slides
that we touched already in the course.

155
00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:04.180
It kind of shows you what
the different components are.

156
00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:07.130
>> So, real quick,
I want to touch on this little pamphlet.

157
00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:08.870
Inside here, you saw we have,

158
00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:13.350
like Rajan said, all of the diagrams
with all of the components.

159
00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:17.405
But, what I would recommend doing is,
and on the back,

160
00:08:17.405 --> 00:08:22.774
you can kind of see,
there is a www.arrow.com/dragonboard410c.

161
00:08:22.774 --> 00:08:27.577
What you're going to want to also do is
visit either Qualcomm Developer Network or

162
00:08:27.577 --> 00:08:31.100
the 96Boards DragonBoard
410c landing page.

163
00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:32.869
These aren't included on the pamphlet, but

164
00:08:32.869 --> 00:08:35.671
they are very useful resources that
we will talk about in a later video.

165
00:08:35.671 --> 00:08:40.452
>> Mm-hm, let's go ahead and
take this little piece out, and

166
00:08:40.452 --> 00:08:42.720
that's your DragonBoard.

167
00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:45.450
So since this is the basic kit,
it only comes with the DragonBoard.

168
00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:47.030
Let's put this on the side also.

169
00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:52.010
And as you can see,
it comes in an ESD bag all taped up.

170
00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.970
With a disclaimer right here,
it says attention.

171
00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:58.540
Be careful while you use your DragonBoard.

172
00:08:58.540 --> 00:08:59.949
Let's go ahead and open that.

173
00:08:59.949 --> 00:09:02.255
>> Kind of the picture that
I put on the safety tips.

174
00:09:02.255 --> 00:09:03.939
>> Yeah [LAUGH].

175
00:09:09.269 --> 00:09:11.906
>> And there you have your DragonBoard.

176
00:09:11.906 --> 00:09:14.280
>> And you can see as mentioned here,
right?

177
00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:18.790
This is the shield that's covering
the chipsets underneath there.

178
00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:22.340
So in the diagrams that we showed
earlier with all of the features,

179
00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:26.090
all of the components, you don't get to
see them when you open up your board.

180
00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:27.903
And a nice little Arrow sticker there.

181
00:09:27.903 --> 00:09:29.260
>> Sticker there, yeah.

182
00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.670
So as you can see, this is a low speed
expansion header, high speed header,

183
00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:37.750
SD card holder, HDMI connector,
USB ports, power connector right here,

184
00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:41.160
the two switches right here for
volume up and volume down.

185
00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:44.060
And those are really useful if

186
00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:46.360
you want to flash the DragonBoard
using fast put method.

187
00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:51.760
We'll get more into that in
one of the next sessions.

188
00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:54.630
But on the back you can see
that the switch is right there.

189
00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:56.293
>> And
the there's a little heat sink square.

190
00:09:56.293 --> 00:09:57.129
>> Yeah.

191
00:09:57.129 --> 00:10:01.815
>> Another cool thing to point out
here is probably, move this aside,

192
00:10:01.815 --> 00:10:06.833
is a little analogue header, and
this makes the DragonBoard very unique

193
00:10:06.833 --> 00:10:11.604
in the sense that you can [INAUDIBLE]
on a nice little header on there and

194
00:10:11.604 --> 00:10:16.895
gain access to microphones, speakers,
other analog inputs and outputs.

195
00:10:16.895 --> 00:10:18.150
So yeah.

196
00:10:20.123 --> 00:10:21.700
There's your Dragonboard 410c, great.

197
00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:26.130
So in the next video, we're going to talk
a little bit more about the software

198
00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:29.820
that's available on the Dragonboard 410c,
dive a little deeper into that.

199
00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:34.202
And then we're going to flash
our Linux Linaro Debian

200
00:10:34.202 --> 00:10:37.825
based operating system onto the
DragonBoard 410c because that's what we're

201
00:10:37.825 --> 00:10:39.670
going to be using in
the rest of this course.

202
00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:43.805
And now it's time to pause and reflect
on everything that we saw in this video,

203
00:10:43.805 --> 00:10:45.633
around the DragonBoard 410c.

204
00:10:45.633 --> 00:10:49.209
The unboxing experience,
the different kits that are available.

205
00:10:49.209 --> 00:10:53.121
And all the operating systems that you
might want to choose from once you open

206
00:10:53.121 --> 00:10:55.710
your board and get it all set up.

207
00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:57.770
Here's a whole bunch of resources for
you to go check out.

208
00:10:57.770 --> 00:11:00.790
Now, I want to just point out,
we have the Qualcomm Developer Network.

209
00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:04.230
This is a great resource for you to go
check out some niche documentation.

210
00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:07.800
You have the products page,
with the DragonBoard landing page.

211
00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:10.279
And then of course arrow.com and
amazon.com,

212
00:11:10.279 --> 00:11:13.790
where you can just type
DragonBoard 410c into the search.

213
00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:15.717
And get a whole bunch of options for
your kits.
