00:00:02.423 --> 00:00:06.177
Now it's time to learn how
to shut down your board.

2
00:00:06.177 --> 00:00:11.053
I mean, all in all, it should be pretty
self-explanatory, especially for

3
00:00:11.053 --> 00:00:14.190
these operating systems that we're using.

4
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.570
However, we would like to go
over some safe steps to take

5
00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.770
while shutting down your board.

6
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.180
So if you are using the Android operating
system, you'll notice that on the board

7
00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.910
you have three buttons, one which is a
power button, one which is a plus button,

8
00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.570
and one which is a minus button.

9
00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.020
The power button essentially
serves as almost like the lock

10
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.600
button on your cell phone or
the power button on your cell phone.

11
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.860
Now, if you want to power down from
Android, you're going to hold down

12
00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.740
the power button until you're
prompted with a screen that says,

13
00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.780
would you like to shut down your device.

14
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.415
You'd simply click that and
wait for the device to power down.

15
00:00:53.415 --> 00:00:55.185
If you're observing your
monitor at the time,

16
00:00:55.185 --> 00:00:57.415
you'll notice that the signal will leave.

17
00:00:57.415 --> 00:01:00.205
It will basically say that
the signal is lost and

18
00:01:00.205 --> 00:01:04.215
you are now able to unplug
your device safely.

19
00:01:04.215 --> 00:01:08.895
If you don't follow this procedure, then
sometimes you could corrupt some files on

20
00:01:08.895 --> 00:01:11.585
there and you might have to
reflash an operating system.

21
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.162
>> And it's important that you
unplug it after you boot it down,

22
00:01:17.162 --> 00:01:21.070
because occasionally it could boot
back up and you don't want that.

23
00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.930
Now, working with Ubuntu and Windows 10,

24
00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.885
it's, I mean,
it's really basic how to shut it down.

25
00:01:26.885 --> 00:01:29.690
You can locate it in the bottom
left corner or top left,

26
00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.050
depending on the operating,
how it's set up at the time.

27
00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.626
They have a shutdown menu where
you can just click shutdown and

28
00:01:37.626 --> 00:01:40.180
your, the board should boot off.

29
00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.500
You can also, if you want, go into the
terminal if you already have it open and

30
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.970
you're working on programming, you can do
a pseudo shutdown to boot down the board.

31
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.130
And, again, just make sure you unplug
the power after you shut it down so

32
00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.310
it makes sure it doesn't
boot back on again.

33
00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.590
>> Yeah, it boots back on after
about ten seconds, I think.

34
00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.499
>> Yeah, after a little while
if you leave the power on,

35
00:01:59.499 --> 00:02:01.509
because that's how we turn it
on is just plugging it in.

36
00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:02.009
>> Yeah.
>> So

37
00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:02.509
>> All right.
