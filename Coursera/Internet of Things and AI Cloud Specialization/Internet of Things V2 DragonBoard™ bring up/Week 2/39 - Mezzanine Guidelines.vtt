00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.292
Now, while we understand that many of you will only want to be consuming Mezzanines,

2
00:00:06.292 --> 00:00:10.820
it's still important that at some point down the line in case you decide

3
00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:12.560
you'd ever like to make your own or

4
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.515
participate in a community initiative to make your own,

5
00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:20.240
you are familiar with both the location of the Mezzanine guidelines and

6
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.130
how you can utilize them to push your Mezzanine forward, right?

7
00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:26.855
So, we're going to go over these guidelines.

8
00:00:26.855 --> 00:00:31.820
Now, what is the purpose of the Mezzanine Guidelines?

9
00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.070
First off, when you were developing

10
00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.775
these Mezzanines that are interacting with all of the IO on your DragonBoard,

11
00:00:37.775 --> 00:00:43.625
you want to make sure that you're utilizing both the IO to it's maximum capability,

12
00:00:43.625 --> 00:00:48.370
but also that you don't accidentally short anything out, right?

13
00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.990
So, according to the 96Boards specification,

14
00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.810
we've taken that spec which the DragonBoard follows,

15
00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.640
and then we've built upon it by saying,

16
00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.790
now if you want to utilize all these IO's,

17
00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.070
follow these guidelines, and you can make

18
00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.910
a perfect Mezzanine that will join the ecosystem full-fledged.

19
00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.285
Now, I'm just going to kind of go down these bullet points here but again,

20
00:01:08.285 --> 00:01:11.090
I said it's based on the Consumer Edition specification,

21
00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.480
the guidelines follow it very strictly.

22
00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.065
Now, we also defined two different types of Mezzanine boards,

23
00:01:18.065 --> 00:01:20.230
small modules and larger modules.

24
00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:22.070
You kind of got to experience that in

25
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.970
the last video where we showed a regular sized Mezzanine which fits

26
00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.000
the 96Boards footprint and then a larger module which

27
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.980
goes extended slightly bigger than the footprint.

28
00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.577
This helps you develop for either.

29
00:01:35.577 --> 00:01:39.480
We highlight considerations for possible PCBs.

30
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.615
We want to make sure that the guidelines ensure your compatibility,

31
00:01:43.615 --> 00:01:46.590
so if you're developing a Mezzanine and you want to make sure that you're

32
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.752
compatible with the 96Boards ecosystem more importantly the DragonBoard 410c,

33
00:01:50.752 --> 00:01:53.985
these guidelines will help make that happen.

34
00:01:53.985 --> 00:01:57.403
And then, ultimately what's the goal?

35
00:01:57.403 --> 00:02:01.155
If the goal is to just get something out there

36
00:02:01.155 --> 00:02:05.790
that you want to use for yourself and yourself only, that's fine.

37
00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:11.430
However, we would really like it if you let the community know and not only that,

38
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.270
we'd also really like it if the community accepted it and used it for

39
00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.485
their projects because it is an ecosystem and this is a very fun,

40
00:02:19.485 --> 00:02:22.440
engaging, and vibrant community.

41
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.335
So, if you're working on Mezzanine products,

42
00:02:25.335 --> 00:02:28.410
if you want to start getting into some hardware stuff

43
00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.215
that will complement your DragonBoard 410c journey,

44
00:02:32.215 --> 00:02:34.450
make sure you let the community in,

45
00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:35.575
I think it's a lot of fun,

46
00:02:35.575 --> 00:02:37.675
it's very interactive, and it's very cool.

47
00:02:37.675 --> 00:02:40.110
And in the next video, we're going to talk a little bit more about

48
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.675
how you can get more involved with this.

49
00:02:43.675 --> 00:02:45.550
So looking at the guidelines,

50
00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.630
I just basically took the guidelines document,

51
00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.075
we're going to see the link in the resources in a minute,

52
00:02:50.075 --> 00:02:55.215
but I took the guidelines document and I just brought down the table of contents,

53
00:02:55.215 --> 00:02:57.335
and I just want to break this down a little bit.

54
00:02:57.335 --> 00:02:59.810
So first off, Naming Conventions,

55
00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.300
why is this important, right?

56
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.890
Well, when you're talking naming conventions across

57
00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.245
different Mezzanines and across the 96Boards ecosystem,

58
00:03:07.245 --> 00:03:09.410
you want to make sure that you're fairly consistent.

59
00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.190
These conventions helped make it easier for

60
00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.430
people to both adopt your board and use it, right?

61
00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.630
There is of course, mechanical specifications,

62
00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.390
that helped conform to the form factor making

63
00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.610
sure that your headers are all lined up when you're plugging it in,

64
00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.306
giving you different options on stacking options,

65
00:03:29.306 --> 00:03:32.793
we did mention that some of the 96Boards Mezzanines,

66
00:03:32.793 --> 00:03:35.885
some of them aren't stackable, some of them are.

67
00:03:35.885 --> 00:03:38.087
If you want this to remain an option for you,

68
00:03:38.087 --> 00:03:40.340
these guidelines helped you outline that.

69
00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.050
Now, you also have a test specification.

70
00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:49.400
This is a template that we've kind of helped guide through to you,

71
00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.380
so that if you want to start building upon this and

72
00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.930
we will again talk about this in the next video a little more.

73
00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.455
Power options, thermal considerations,

74
00:03:56.455 --> 00:03:59.965
you're putting something on top of something that could be potentially hot, right?

75
00:03:59.965 --> 00:04:02.415
So, we want to make sure that you think about these things,

76
00:04:02.415 --> 00:04:04.890
and then give you baselines for it.

77
00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.570
And then, of course, peripheral connectors.

78
00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:10.715
So, there are a lot of things that should be considered.

79
00:04:10.715 --> 00:04:12.120
The document is not that long,

80
00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.000
I think it's only several few pages, three, four,

81
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.820
five pages, and it's geared to just helping

82
00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.905
you join this movement which is a really cool movement.

83
00:04:21.905 --> 00:04:23.890
Yeah and it also, as a developer of it,

84
00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:25.380
I'm looking at the ecosystem.

85
00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.665
It tells me when I'm selecting a development platform,

86
00:04:28.665 --> 00:04:32.085
it tells me there is some standardization behind it.

87
00:04:32.085 --> 00:04:35.782
So, if I find a Mezzanine board that works for the vertical time I'm targeting,

88
00:04:35.782 --> 00:04:41.005
I know that the people who created the Mezzanine followed some standard guidelines,

89
00:04:41.005 --> 00:04:44.520
so that's going to work with the 96Board ecosystem,

90
00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.750
and as a developer,

91
00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.880
you don't want to be picking up hardware off the shelf,

92
00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.805
and then troubleshoot the hardware, right?

93
00:04:49.805 --> 00:04:53.025
So, that's a good thing about this that when

94
00:04:53.025 --> 00:04:56.855
community does this and somebody picks up this Mezzanine and starts using it,

95
00:04:56.855 --> 00:05:00.115
they are not first one strength for troubleshooting, people have used it before,

96
00:05:00.115 --> 00:05:02.115
it's belongs to the ecosystem,

97
00:05:02.115 --> 00:05:04.770
and out of the box, that's going to work.

98
00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.240
Absolutely.

99
00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.080
Along with resell,

100
00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.175
I want to add just a little thing.

101
00:05:09.175 --> 00:05:12.415
You just paid money for your DragonBoard, right?

102
00:05:12.415 --> 00:05:16.230
The last thing you want to do is buy some Mezzanine or acquire

103
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:21.320
some Mezzanine or make a Mezzanine that's going to blow it up, right?

104
00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:26.265
So, these guidelines help make sure that you map

105
00:05:26.265 --> 00:05:32.595
all of the IO on your DragonBoard to the appropriate IO,

106
00:05:32.595 --> 00:05:35.932
outputs, ports, whatever you want to call it on your Mezzanine,

107
00:05:35.932 --> 00:05:37.000
so you can utilize it all.

108
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.420
And if you follow the guidelines properly,

109
00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:42.780
then you run less of a chance of blowing up your DragonBoard.

110
00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:43.890
So, very cool.

111
00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:46.940
Yeah. Now, anything else?

112
00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:47.371
No, that's it.

113
00:05:47.371 --> 00:05:51.345
Okay. Cool. So in summary, again, pause,

114
00:05:51.345 --> 00:05:57.090
reflect, and explore the 96Boards Mezzanine guidelines.

115
00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:00.060
Now, I didn't put the link here specifically however,

116
00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:03.630
if you do go to the 96Boards products Mezzanine page,

117
00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:06.705
you'll find along with

118
00:06:06.705 --> 00:06:11.585
all the Mezzanine boards that we consider compatible with your DragonBoard 410c,

119
00:06:11.585 --> 00:06:15.821
you will find a link at the top or on that page somewhere,

120
00:06:15.821 --> 00:06:20.815
I believe it's at the top, for the Mezzanine guidelines.

121
00:06:20.815 --> 00:06:23.355
So, check that out, it's a little downloadable PDF,

122
00:06:23.355 --> 00:06:26.280
read through it, and maybe you'll learn something,

123
00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:29.640
and then tune in for the next video where we'll talk a little bit more

124
00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:34.040
about the Community Mezzanine Initiative Overachievers.

125
00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.670
Go ahead and read ahead.

126
00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:37.780
See you in the next video.
