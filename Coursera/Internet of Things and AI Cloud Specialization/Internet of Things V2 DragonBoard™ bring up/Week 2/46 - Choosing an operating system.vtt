00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:03.940
It's time to talk to you about
the operating systems that

2
00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.790
are available to you for
your Dragon Board 410 C.

3
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.612
First off, as we've mentioned
several times is Android.

4
00:00:10.612 --> 00:00:15.504
And Android is a very special
operating system that allows you to

5
00:00:15.504 --> 00:00:20.397
basically develop applications
similar to what you would do for

6
00:00:20.397 --> 00:00:23.148
your cell phone or Android tablet.

7
00:00:23.148 --> 00:00:26.630
It's a Linux-based platform for
mobile devices.

8
00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.840
In order to develop applications or

9
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.370
programs for an Android operating system,
you're gonna actually have to get an IDE,

10
00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.740
which stands for integrated
development environment, I believe.

11
00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:47.720
Yeah, so once you get your IDE,
which we will teach you how to do later

12
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.980
on in this course,
either Android Studios or Eclipse.

13
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.460
For us personally,
we'll be using Android Studios.

14
00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.820
You can begin developing for Android.

15
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.230
It is application centric so

16
00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.720
you're not really going to be running much
hardware off of Android, or traditionally

17
00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.310
you would not be running much hardware
off of your cell phone, as you know.

18
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.650
But when I say hardware I mean robots and
stuff like that.

19
00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.760
>> Yeah, but applications can be made and
you can still get that kind of stuff done.

20
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:20.680
It's just not as easy.

21
00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.720
>> Yeah, and we are going to show
you how to do that anyways, so yeah.

22
00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.332
>> Yeah and so
my favorite though was Ubuntu.

23
00:01:28.332 --> 00:01:30.561
I like the whole desktop feel a lot more,
and so

24
00:01:30.561 --> 00:01:34.800
that's the one that I've currently been
spending a lot of time working with.

25
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.230
>> It's Linux software for
ARM architecture again, but now you have

26
00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:44.570
a desktop feel, so you'll be able to
have file managers and things like that.

27
00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.560
You get access the Internet really easily,

28
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.740
which I guess you can from
Android probably too.

29
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.300
But I just like the feel of having
a mouse and a keyboard, and

30
00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.780
being able to program
directly onto the board.

31
00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.770
With Ubuntu you have no
real language restrictions.

32
00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.720
They should have C compilers,
Java compilers.

33
00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.250
I know it's really easy to get those on
there if they're not already preinstalled.

34
00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.230
Personally I like using Python, and so

35
00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:12.570
I spent a lot of time working
on projects with that.

36
00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.400
And again, for me personally I
find it really easy to use Ubuntu,

37
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.870
to be able to work with a lot of hardware
and to access the GPIO really easily.

38
00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.160
And so we've taken the time to
quickly write some GPIO libraries and

39
00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.920
stuff like that so we can very
quickly access them through programs.

40
00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.540
>> Yeah so I actually wanted to
mention that, he reminded me.

41
00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.420
One of the big differences between Android
and Ubuntu will be the fact that like he

42
00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.460
said you can basically program
right on your board with Ubuntu.

43
00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.261
With Android you're actually gonna be
using a computer host or a PC host,

44
00:02:44.261 --> 00:02:47.879
where you write your applications or
your programs on your computer,

45
00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:49.802
and then you send them to your board.

46
00:02:49.802 --> 00:02:53.416
As opposed to Ubuntu where you're just
literally programming on the board

47
00:02:53.416 --> 00:02:56.180
with a keyboard and mouse,
kinda like he has set up here.

48
00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.270
>> Idle 3 opened up, and you just type
it in there and then you're good.

49
00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.190
>> Yeah, I'll have to use a text editor.

50
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.980
So another thing is that

51
00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.970
the the Ubuntu software can also be
operated by a command line only.

52
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.850
So if you really were savvy with Unix or
something like that,

53
00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:18.910
you can just boot right into
a command line, no desktop at all.

54
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.380
And basically perform the exact same
things that you were doing on the desktop.

55
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.290
There's definitely a lot
of versatility with Ubuntu.

56
00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.990
Windows 10,
it's currently not available right now.

57
00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:36.650
It will be available, and
they are going to be having a lot of

58
00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.980
programming abilities when this is
released for a dev board like this.

59
00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.060
You're gonna have access to a dev center,

60
00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:50.590
insider programs that kinda teach you
how to begin developing for Windows.

61
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.150
I believe they're kind of starting to
push towards that application market,

62
00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.170
Windows Store, stuff like that.

63
00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.620
So there's gonna be a lot of fun
possibilities in the future with Windows

64
00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.754
10, especially with a dev board like this,
pushing applications out in the market.

65
00:04:07.754 --> 00:04:08.254
Yeah.
