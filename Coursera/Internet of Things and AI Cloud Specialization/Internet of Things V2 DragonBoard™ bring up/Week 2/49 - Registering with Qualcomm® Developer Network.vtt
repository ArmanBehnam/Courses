00:00:03.862 --> 00:00:09.807
Now that you've purged your board, you've
registered for the 96boards.org website,

2
00:00:09.807 --> 00:00:14.760
and we're ready to register for
the Qualcomm developer network.

3
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.540
We find this important because not only do
you get to access all the documentation

4
00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:23.610
that's been provided at the 96boards
website, but you also are gonna gain

5
00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:29.060
access to some other technical
documents by registering here as well.

6
00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.917
So, first step would be to go to
the developer network website which

7
00:00:33.917 --> 00:00:36.317
is developer.qualcomm.com.

8
00:00:36.317 --> 00:00:39.260
You're gonna click the register button.

9
00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.817
You're gonna basically go through
the exact same process we've already

10
00:00:42.817 --> 00:00:44.429
went through for registration.

11
00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:46.151
>> Email, password, username.

12
00:00:46.151 --> 00:00:46.763
>> Yeah, but

13
00:00:46.763 --> 00:00:51.660
we did wanna talk about why it's important
to get this Qualcomm developer password.

14
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.943
So, what is a Qualcomm ID?

15
00:00:53.943 --> 00:00:59.523
Your Qualcomm ID is actually gonna
allow you to maneuver through multiple

16
00:00:59.523 --> 00:01:04.670
Qualcomm websites, and
log in with the single login and password.

17
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.880
So definitely important to get this
registered as soon as possible

18
00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.220
to kind of start accessing things that
you wouldn't otherwise have no access to.

19
00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.590
Yeah, so you filled out your information,
you're almost there.

20
00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.480
Go check your email,
that's what my email looked like.

21
00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:28.565
And get your Qualcomm ID-
>> Just in case you have trouble.

22
00:01:28.565 --> 00:01:30.520
>> [LAUGH] Just in case you have trouble,
yeah.

23
00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.580
Once you've done that, your account
has been verified, you can go in and

24
00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.580
log in for your first time.

25
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.190
So yeah, go ahead,
through you information in there.

26
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.090
Click on through, and
choose a display name.

27
00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.510
The display name is basically kind
of like your tag, your handle.

28
00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.210
And, yeah, as you can see,
agree with you the terms of use, again,

29
00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.340
click on through that.

30
00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.880
There's a notice that you have to
accept to continue, click on that, and

31
00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.960
you are in, all right?

32
00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.900
So as you can see at the bottom,
it kind of shows how long you've been

33
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.380
registered with
the Qualcomm Developer Network.

34
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.220
I don't know,
that's pretty cool, but yeah.

35
00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.990
From here, you can pretty much go
anywhere you want within the site.

36
00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.670
Check hardware, download software, forums,

37
00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.150
there's a lot of really good resources
within this registration process.

38
00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.840
>> And this is where you get all your
Ubuntu and Android stuff that you need,

39
00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.340
right, for different operating systems?

40
00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.690
>> Well, I believe you can get it here.

41
00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.100
It is a little easier to get
through the 96boards, but

42
00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.380
yeah, I mean, it's easy to find.

43
00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.310
>> They have a lot of extra
software packages and stuff though,

44
00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.950
that can help out with different types of
projects that you wanna do in the future.

45
00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.370
I think, additional graphics and
stuff like that.

46
00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.230
>> Yea, and we're gonna show you how to
get access to all the operating systems

47
00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.580
later in this course, all right.
