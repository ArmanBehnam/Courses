1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.170
Now, we've looked at several aspects of the 96Boards ecosystem and we've focused,

2
00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:06.230
we've honed in on

3
00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.509
all the different resources you have available for the DragonBoard 410c.

4
00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:12.890
But now it's time to kind of take

5
00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:16.595
a step back and approach it from a developer standpoint.

6
00:00:16.595 --> 00:00:19.370
We want to start looking at the different tools that we're going to be

7
00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:23.770
using during our development process throughout the rest of your specialization.

8
00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:27.783
And this is where the mezzanine ecosystem comes into play.

9
00:00:27.783 --> 00:00:31.040
So, what are we going to cover in this video?

10
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.126
First, Rajan asks the question,

11
00:00:33.126 --> 00:00:35.430
What is mezzanine?

12
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.068
Then, we'll talk about the mezzanine ecosystem at

13
00:00:38.068 --> 00:00:41.875
more of a high level what is the mezzanine ecosystem.

14
00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:46.600
We'll see the different types of boards that we have available on the market right now.

15
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.375
Then we'll go over our resources and throughout the course of this lesson,

16
00:00:50.375 --> 00:00:52.880
we're going to see a lot more about mezzanines and

17
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.450
the different initiatives that are around the DragonBoard 410c.

18
00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.150
So, Rajan once again.

19
00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.555
So, in terms of what's available to the developers, right?

20
00:01:02.555 --> 00:01:05.485
I think you hit a very good point earlier

21
00:01:05.485 --> 00:01:09.000
when you said tools available to the developers, right?

22
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.405
It's really important to enable the developers with the right tools for

23
00:01:13.405 --> 00:01:20.350
their vertical that they are targeting and if they are equipped with the right tools,

24
00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.405
they can actually make a difference, right?

25
00:01:24.405 --> 00:01:28.885
And with that said, we have the DragonBoard which is a development platform, right?

26
00:01:28.885 --> 00:01:32.250
But it's not all encompassing.

27
00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.600
It's basically, with the DragonBoard,

28
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.875
you have an entire 96Board ecosystem that goes with the DragonBoard

29
00:01:37.875 --> 00:01:42.130
and for somebody new coming to the ecosystem,

30
00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.875
that is new to the environment,

31
00:01:44.875 --> 00:01:47.275
they will always have this question, what is a mezzanine?

32
00:01:47.275 --> 00:01:50.170
Yes. So, that's why we have this slide for

33
00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.680
you and we're going to kind of summarize this as quickly as possible.

34
00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.570
Now, many of you have probably heard of

35
00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.840
the Raspberry Pi Hat or the Arduino Shield, right?

36
00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.840
Well, essentially a hat is something that's on

37
00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.305
top and a shield is something that's in front or maybe on top, I guess.

38
00:02:05.305 --> 00:02:10.030
The mezzanine is also something that is considered to be an upper layer.

39
00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.865
Now, many airports you may have gone to or malls,

40
00:02:12.865 --> 00:02:14.875
they have their mezzanine level,

41
00:02:14.875 --> 00:02:17.600
and that's the level that's above other levels.

42
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.840
So, that's where the name mezzanine comes from.

43
00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.635
It is similar to the Raspberry Pi Hat and the Arduino Shield in

44
00:02:22.635 --> 00:02:26.720
that it sits on top of your DragonBoard 410c.

45
00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.030
Now, what is the purpose of this mezzanine and

46
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.830
what Rajan was talking about when you look at developer tools, right?

47
00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.730
Your 96Board, your DragonBoard 410c,

48
00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.095
that's a small footprint.

49
00:02:39.095 --> 00:02:41.185
I mean, you're talking the size of a credit card.

50
00:02:41.185 --> 00:02:46.360
You're talking about putting all of this functionality onto something very tiny,

51
00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.130
and in a lot of cases not everything and not everyone will need

52
00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:56.403
every single aspect of your input-output that would be available to you.

53
00:02:56.403 --> 00:02:58.825
In actuality, if I don't work with cameras,

54
00:02:58.825 --> 00:03:00.555
I don't need access to cameras, right?

55
00:03:00.555 --> 00:03:05.894
So, mezzanines come into play when you want to extend the 96Boards' capabilities,

56
00:03:05.894 --> 00:03:08.980
and this means you're honing in on the high speed and

57
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:15.070
low speed headers that are available to you for your I/O, your different I/O.

58
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.890
Now, when you look at mezzanines, which we're going to,

59
00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.750
you can actually see them on the slide there,

60
00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.195
these are all different shapes and forms of mezzanines.

61
00:03:22.195 --> 00:03:28.095
But the one thing they have in common is that they all snap onto your DragonBoard 410c.

62
00:03:28.095 --> 00:03:30.010
That's amazing.

63
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.684
That means that the people who made these mezzanines,

64
00:03:31.684 --> 00:03:35.800
community, industry partners alike, they all said,

65
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.530
"I'm going to take into account all of the different inputs and

66
00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.664
outputs on the low speed and high speed expansion headers of the DragonBoard

67
00:03:41.664 --> 00:03:49.255
and I am going to make sure that this board accents a feature, some feature."

68
00:03:49.255 --> 00:03:54.925
Now, the beauty of this is that the 96Boards ecosystem is very large,

69
00:03:54.925 --> 00:03:59.200
and people might be making mezzanines for all different purposes.

70
00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.935
The good thing is that even if they made this for something else,

71
00:04:02.935 --> 00:04:05.035
for a purpose that they care about,

72
00:04:05.035 --> 00:04:07.500
you can still consume it because you're using a

73
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.870
96Boards and the DragonBoard is ideal for that.

74
00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.265
Now, they do serve a specific purpose.

75
00:04:13.265 --> 00:04:15.215
In many cases, you're going to find that,

76
00:04:15.215 --> 00:04:17.140
and we'll talk about this in a minute,

77
00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:21.190
that maybe one mezzanine addresses cameras.

78
00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.780
Another mezzanine might address sensors.

79
00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.160
One mezzanine might address sensors and cameras, right?

80
00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.620
You just never really know and the people just keep pushing out these mezzanines and I

81
00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:38.135
think that we're coming into a time where the possibilities are now endless.

82
00:04:38.135 --> 00:04:39.910
People are just exploring and creating

83
00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.610
all sorts of cool new ways to interact with your DragonBoard.

84
00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.110
What's the last point here?

85
00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.265
Fun projects and/or serious development.

86
00:04:48.265 --> 00:04:50.595
So, from start to finish, right?

87
00:04:50.595 --> 00:04:56.643
So, it's basically any vertical that you want to target either you are a hobbyist,

88
00:04:56.643 --> 00:04:58.930
you want to do something for your home,

89
00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:00.852
you can get mezzanines that interact with

90
00:05:00.852 --> 00:05:04.690
basic sensors like light sensors, proximity sensors,

91
00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:07.660
ultrasonic sensors, moisture sensors,

92
00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:13.731
to if you want to really go into industrial projects with a low range RF, right?

93
00:05:13.731 --> 00:05:20.090
So, you have mezzanines targeting board spectrums off of use cases.

94
00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.265
And I've run into all different kinds of people, right?

95
00:05:23.265 --> 00:05:24.970
So, I mean, there are some people who are using

96
00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:27.545
their DragonBoard as a hobbyist, like Rajan said.

97
00:05:27.545 --> 00:05:31.150
And then you would just maybe say want to accent some sensors,

98
00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:32.560
use some of the GPIOs,

99
00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.210
some of that functionality to have some fun.

100
00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.960
Now, we're going to talk a

101
00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.072
little bit deeper on all the different mezzanines that are available.

102
00:05:41.072 --> 00:05:44.080
I missed the point. So, opens doors in path to product.

103
00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:48.595
And we'll talk more about this later in this section.

104
00:05:48.595 --> 00:05:52.760
Yes, excellent. So the mezzanine ecosystem.

105
00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.390
Now, we can talk all day about this.

106
00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:57.750
I'm pretty sure that Rajan and I combined.

107
00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:59.259
Robert can talk all day about this.

108
00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:01.260
I'll talk all day and he'll listen.

109
00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:02.370
I'll let him talk, I'll vouch for that, yeah.

110
00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:08.930
So, the best thing you can do for yourself is to go visit the the mezzanine ecosystem.

111
00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:10.755
This is a guideline section here.

112
00:06:10.755 --> 00:06:14.490
So, we have what is a mezzanine described up on top.

113
00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:17.948
You can see all the different mezzanines that 96Boards is hosting.

114
00:06:17.948 --> 00:06:21.960
All of these should be compatible with your DragonBoard 410c.

115
00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.565
So, take some time. Maybe pause the video right here.

116
00:06:24.565 --> 00:06:27.250
We'll have you pause it again when we get to the resources section.

117
00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:30.360
But pause the video here and go take a look real quick at the mezzanine section.

118
00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:31.655
We're not going to click it or show you,

119
00:06:31.655 --> 00:06:33.315
you can go check it out yourself.

120
00:06:33.315 --> 00:06:36.495
But for those of you who continue on,

121
00:06:36.495 --> 00:06:38.250
we are going to walk through some of

122
00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:43.775
the most prominent mezzanines that are currently available to you right now.

123
00:06:43.775 --> 00:06:46.245
Now, we were talking about sensors, right?

124
00:06:46.245 --> 00:06:49.695
Here are four mezzanines that are available to you.

125
00:06:49.695 --> 00:06:53.726
And maybe we can get a shot of some of these here on the table that we have.

126
00:06:53.726 --> 00:06:57.780
But here are four mezzanine that are available to you.

127
00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:01.740
One which we have out which is the STM32.

128
00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:06.621
Something to notice on the STM32 is that this mezzanine,

129
00:07:06.621 --> 00:07:08.265
once again you look at the backside,

130
00:07:08.265 --> 00:07:12.270
you have the high speed connector and then you have the low speed connector right here.

131
00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:14.820
So this just seamlessly plugs right on top of

132
00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:18.535
your DragonBoard and accents a variety of features.

133
00:07:18.535 --> 00:07:21.915
This one brings out not only sensors or, sorry,

134
00:07:21.915 --> 00:07:24.795
not only I/O but it also brings out

135
00:07:24.795 --> 00:07:28.045
the ability to use a camera from the high speed expansion header.

136
00:07:28.045 --> 00:07:30.975
Another good thing to note here, which is really cool,

137
00:07:30.975 --> 00:07:33.420
is that if you look very carefully,

138
00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:37.215
you'll see two headers that come along the vertical here.

139
00:07:37.215 --> 00:07:45.015
These headers are identical to the Arduino output, right?

140
00:07:45.015 --> 00:07:46.410
So, the footprint of the Arduino.

141
00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:50.010
That means that any shield that you would be able to

142
00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:53.760
use with the Arduino would be able to be used on top of this mezzanine.

143
00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:56.140
So, stack this on your DragonBoard.

144
00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:57.945
If you want to use some Arduino stuff,

145
00:07:57.945 --> 00:07:59.755
stack that on top here.

146
00:07:59.755 --> 00:08:02.825
Now, this isn't an Arduino chip and Arduino, I believe, is a branding.

147
00:08:02.825 --> 00:08:04.155
This is a different chip.

148
00:08:04.155 --> 00:08:07.135
Yeah, this has the STM microchip on it.

149
00:08:07.135 --> 00:08:11.550
So, any developer who is familiar with working in the STM space,

150
00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:13.530
if they've worked with those microcontrollers before,

151
00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:18.615
this is a good starting point for them to start interacting with different sensors,

152
00:08:18.615 --> 00:08:22.830
and actually do a lot of the core processing on the DragonBoard and

153
00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:27.810
just leave the sensor driving the sensors to the STM board.

154
00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:31.950
So, honestly, this board has packed quite a few things on here.

155
00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:34.650
You also have access to the serial console here,

156
00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:36.595
which is on one of the UARTs.

157
00:08:36.595 --> 00:08:39.000
You have access to the different I/Os here,

158
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.400
which would allow you to be compatible with Arduino shields.

159
00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.940
You have access, I believe, to I2Cs,

160
00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:47.040
over here various GPIO, cameras.

161
00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:49.505
I mean, there's a lot of cool stuff going on here.

162
00:08:49.505 --> 00:08:51.780
So, this is definitely one that's worth checking out.

163
00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:52.830
It is available, I believe,

164
00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:56.130
on Arrow.com as well as some other sites.

165
00:08:56.130 --> 00:09:01.165
Another one that you just saw on that slide would be the 96Boards sensor mezzanine.

166
00:09:01.165 --> 00:09:04.110
And this one was one of the first mezzanines ever created.

167
00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:08.784
To be honest, it was created by one of our fellows or our fellow of Linaro,

168
00:09:08.784 --> 00:09:13.320
Grant Likely, and this was one of the original 96Boards templates.

169
00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:15.570
Now, once again, you can also see that first of all,

170
00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:19.965
it breaks out different Grove connectors for I2C use,

171
00:09:19.965 --> 00:09:24.185
GPIO use, as well as once again the Arduino header.

172
00:09:24.185 --> 00:09:28.780
So, making your DragonBoard compatible with Arduino shields.

173
00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:30.000
Very cool. Very cool.

174
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.690
Now, one thing you won't see here is the high speed expansion header, right?

175
00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:36.290
So, there was no reason to break out the high speed expansion header.

176
00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:40.300
They're not really using cameras on this one like the STM one does.

177
00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:45.520
Another I/O mezzanine, do we have another I/O mezzanine out here?

178
00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:46.610
There were more on the slides.

179
00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:48.560
So, we don't have any more on the table here but there are more

180
00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:50.600
on the slide and there are more available to you.

181
00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:51.800
Oh yes, so the Arrow kit.

182
00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:54.660
Either way, I think that's upside down,

183
00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:57.915
but either way, there are plenty of them.

184
00:09:57.915 --> 00:10:01.090
Please feel free to visit the website.

185
00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:05.267
Moving on to more capabilities, sensors, cameras.

186
00:10:05.267 --> 00:10:08.507
We consider cameras to be a sensor, right?

187
00:10:08.507 --> 00:10:11.780
So, here are more options for you to use.

188
00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:13.820
The STM1 is up there again.

189
00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:17.370
But now, we have options like the AIStar vision.

190
00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:22.970
This mezzanine was created literally just for cameras.

191
00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:27.095
Now, a really cool thing about this is they also chose to break out various IO.

192
00:10:27.095 --> 00:10:32.233
However, it's not necessarily set up as the STM-1 or the sensors mezzanine is.

193
00:10:32.233 --> 00:10:34.790
This was a really cool story.

194
00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:36.905
I believe some folks up in the Bay area,

195
00:10:36.905 --> 00:10:38.193
needed a camera mezzanine,

196
00:10:38.193 --> 00:10:42.888
and this was before industrial versions of the camera mezzanine existed.

197
00:10:42.888 --> 00:10:45.548
Instead of just waiting for it to happen,

198
00:10:45.548 --> 00:10:47.165
they built it themselves.

199
00:10:47.165 --> 00:10:50.415
They just said, "Hey, 96Boards specification.

200
00:10:50.415 --> 00:10:52.259
I love the DragonBoard 410C.

201
00:10:52.259 --> 00:10:55.340
I want to work with it. I need a camera," and they built this.

202
00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:57.290
Now, you can go to eBay and you can buy

203
00:10:57.290 --> 00:10:59.900
this for the cost of what it cost them to make it.

204
00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:02.070
I think it's 25 bucks or something.

205
00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:06.450
Very reasonable priced board and it holds two cameras.

206
00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:10.000
So very cool. Definitely worth checking out.

207
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.385
So, another camera mezzanine is basically the D3 mezzanine that we see right here.

208
00:11:15.385 --> 00:11:17.300
That's another camera mezzanine that's

209
00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:19.514
actually bringing out both the MPI-CSI connectors from the DragonBoard

210
00:11:19.514 --> 00:11:26.611
and you can see the connectors right here that you can connect the camera mezzanines.

211
00:11:26.611 --> 00:11:28.735
One of the other things they also do is they pull out

212
00:11:28.735 --> 00:11:33.440
the GPIOs on the headers right here.

213
00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:38.260
Main difference between this and something like SD Micro is that SD Micro has

214
00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:42.370
brought it out to be groove connectors and they are level-shifted.

215
00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:45.375
Whereas, for a D3, the GPIOs are not level-shifted.

216
00:11:45.375 --> 00:11:47.140
They're just brought up from the DragonBoard as is.

217
00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:50.470
So, basic through pin.

218
00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:50.590
Through pin.

219
00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:52.965
We'll talk about one more real quick here.

220
00:11:52.965 --> 00:11:54.900
And this is the AeroCore2.

221
00:11:54.900 --> 00:12:00.480
This board was used in various 96Boards demos.

222
00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:04.115
It was showcased on open hours at one point.

223
00:12:04.115 --> 00:12:05.326
This is the bottom of it.

224
00:12:05.326 --> 00:12:06.775
So, you can see once again,

225
00:12:06.775 --> 00:12:09.625
here's the high speed connector that snaps into the DragonBoard.

226
00:12:09.625 --> 00:12:11.120
Here's the low speed connector.

227
00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:12.370
Now the form factor,

228
00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:14.380
you can also see,

229
00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:17.520
is not the same size as these other boards, right?

230
00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:19.630
So, there are no real limits

231
00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:21.700
to your mezzanine when it comes to what you're putting on top,

232
00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:24.405
the size you're putting on top.

233
00:12:24.405 --> 00:12:31.398
You're more so limited to the spacing between the mezzanine itself and the board.

234
00:12:31.398 --> 00:12:35.410
So, you have a bit of a spacing issue more so than the size that you put on top.

235
00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:38.980
But this one is ideal for drones.

236
00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:41.480
Now believe it or not you can buy this board,

237
00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:43.370
you can buy a DragonBoard 410c,

238
00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:45.600
you can follow our instructions, I believe,

239
00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:48.095
on Qualcomm Developer Network or 96Boards,

240
00:12:48.095 --> 00:12:50.140
and get your bill or materials fulfilled,

241
00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:54.580
walk away with a awesome drone that you built yourself.

242
00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:56.752
And this one also has CAN Bus interface.

243
00:12:56.752 --> 00:13:00.049
So, if you want to talk at automotive industry also this one is a good choice for that.

244
00:13:00.049 --> 00:13:04.960
It has onboard CAN Bus. So you can talk to automotive CAN standards with this.

245
00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:08.486
Great. Back to the slides.

246
00:13:08.486 --> 00:13:09.927
We are making a mess over here.

247
00:13:09.927 --> 00:13:13.765
Next one, HDMI and MIPI-DSI.

248
00:13:13.765 --> 00:13:17.080
Now, I don't have any camera mezzanines here on the table,

249
00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:19.690
but believe me, they're out there. More are coming out.

250
00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:23.438
We really hope to see some high efficiency,

251
00:13:23.438 --> 00:13:29.931
good quality screen mezzanines to come out soon.

252
00:13:29.931 --> 00:13:31.990
Connectivity.

253
00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:35.915
Now, these two are just only recently announced and recently made available.

254
00:13:35.915 --> 00:13:37.235
These are on the table.

255
00:13:37.235 --> 00:13:41.390
I'll talk about one of them right here and then Rajan can talk about the other.

256
00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:45.100
But the first one here is the Ethernet mezzanine.

257
00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:47.905
Now this is a very cool mezzanine because not

258
00:13:47.905 --> 00:13:51.730
only does it allow you to connect to the internet,

259
00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:53.815
everyone wants the internet through ethernet,

260
00:13:53.815 --> 00:13:58.405
but it also has the ability to offer power over ethernet,

261
00:13:58.405 --> 00:14:00.565
otherwise known as POE.

262
00:14:00.565 --> 00:14:02.419
So with the right connector,

263
00:14:02.419 --> 00:14:03.460
with the right cable,

264
00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:05.350
you can give yourself power over ethernet.

265
00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:07.835
This is ideal for networking,

266
00:14:07.835 --> 00:14:12.526
all sorts of applications that would require you to be kind of wired in, right?

267
00:14:12.526 --> 00:14:13.675
On top of that,

268
00:14:13.675 --> 00:14:16.600
this board offers the through pin connector,

269
00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:19.381
which allows you to stack other mezzanines on top.

270
00:14:19.381 --> 00:14:22.165
Say, for instance, you are stacked in,

271
00:14:22.165 --> 00:14:25.000
you have your ethernet plugged in here but then you

272
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.150
still want to plug in a sensor mezzanine as well.

273
00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:30.295
Well, you can just take your sensor mezzanine,

274
00:14:30.295 --> 00:14:34.210
plug that right on top of your ethernet mezzanine and then you'll

275
00:14:34.210 --> 00:14:39.090
have your stackable system there on top of your DragonBoard.

276
00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:40.330
So these are all stackable,

277
00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:42.420
at least for the most part,

278
00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:46.700
provided the limitations of size and stuff,

279
00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:48.305
but very good mezzanine.

280
00:14:48.305 --> 00:14:52.310
I think, also, there's a TPM chip on here for those of you who are interested in security

281
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:58.605
and you can find out more about this again by just visiting the 96Boards mezzanine page.

282
00:14:58.605 --> 00:15:00.595
So, next one we have is LoRa mezzanine.

283
00:15:00.595 --> 00:15:03.555
Again, you see the low-speed expansion header right here.

284
00:15:03.555 --> 00:15:06.755
If you are developing an application where you need to talk to

285
00:15:06.755 --> 00:15:11.097
Beacons wirelessly or a large range,

286
00:15:11.097 --> 00:15:13.400
the LoRa technology is perfect for that.

287
00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:17.800
So, you can see the low- speed expansion header pulled up right here.

288
00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:19.490
Again, this is also stackable.

289
00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:22.205
So, you can stack more mezzanine on top of this.

290
00:15:22.205 --> 00:15:27.020
This is built by LinkSprite in collaboration with Arrow.

291
00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:29.600
So, you can get more resources

292
00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:34.360
for the LoRa technology and this mezzanine on LinkSprite's website.

293
00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:36.755
Great. So, back to the slides.

294
00:15:36.755 --> 00:15:39.355
We can start looking at what else we have.

295
00:15:39.355 --> 00:15:41.880
Two security mezzanines and there's more than this, right?

296
00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:44.105
These are just ones that I was able to throw up on the slides.

297
00:15:44.105 --> 00:15:49.150
Again, I would highly encourage anyone watching this to go poke around the internet,

298
00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:54.383
do some Google searches for 96Boards security mezzanine or 96Boards mezzanine in general.

299
00:15:54.383 --> 00:15:56.046
You'll just see a whole bunch of stuff.

300
00:15:56.046 --> 00:15:58.440
I can't even keep up with the amount of things that are being pushed out.

301
00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:01.159
However, here's some cool mezzanines,

302
00:16:01.159 --> 00:16:07.630
one of which was announced just in Linaro Connect 2017 in San Francisco,

303
00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:09.265
which is the Secure96.

304
00:16:09.265 --> 00:16:12.220
Prior to that, the one on the other side,

305
00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:13.925
the fingerprint and retina scanner,

306
00:16:13.925 --> 00:16:20.544
that's from ArcherMind and that was announced in early 2017 in Budapest.

307
00:16:20.544 --> 00:16:23.299
But, they just keep coming out.

308
00:16:23.299 --> 00:16:27.585
And if you have any more questions here,

309
00:16:27.585 --> 00:16:29.545
you can kind of take a look,

310
00:16:29.545 --> 00:16:31.800
maybe pause it, explore little mezzanines.

311
00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:33.679
There are all shapes and sizes audience mezzanines.

312
00:16:33.679 --> 00:16:36.780
We got to pull out one.

313
00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:42.595
Do you have a mezzanine in mind that you would like to see from the community out there?

314
00:16:42.595 --> 00:16:44.290
Yes, absolutely.

315
00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:45.820
There are many of them, and in fact,

316
00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:49.427
Rajan, we are going to cover that in one of the future videos.

317
00:16:49.427 --> 00:16:49.668
Okay. That's good.

318
00:16:49.668 --> 00:16:53.030
So, we have a lot of really cool stuff to show you.

319
00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:59.485
We have a whole initiative dedicated towards listening to you, the community.

320
00:16:59.485 --> 00:17:03.280
We want to make sure that your needs are met when you're using your DragonBoard,

321
00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:08.930
and you want to access something that you don't have availability to access,

322
00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:10.965
we want to make that possible, right?

323
00:17:10.965 --> 00:17:12.787
So, stay tuned.

324
00:17:12.787 --> 00:17:16.050
Again, we're going to be touching on more mezzanines,

325
00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:20.853
and again, here you go, some mezzanines that have been stacked on here.

326
00:17:20.853 --> 00:17:24.563
But we'll be talking about those later.

327
00:17:24.563 --> 00:17:28.620
So, as you've probably grown used to doing,

328
00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:31.620
this is the time where we pause and reflect on

329
00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:34.500
the things that we've talked about throughout this video.

330
00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:37.410
As you can see, we have our resource slide up.

331
00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:39.870
Please take the time to go visit

332
00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:44.940
the 96Boards mezzanine landing page and the guidelines documentation,

333
00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:48.810
which we will be talking about in our next video if you want

334
00:17:48.810 --> 00:17:53.040
to be one of those overachievers that gets ahead of us.

335
00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:55.230
So, thank you very much.

336
00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:56.515
We'll see you in the next video.

337
00:17:56.515 --> 00:17:58.500
