00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.300
Now that you have the board turned on,
we wanna give you a couple of quick

2
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.140
tips on how you can test to make
sure that everything is working.

3
00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:12.970
Later on we will provide an application
that will help you test it more easily.

4
00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:16.740
But for now,
after you swipe the screen to unlock it,

5
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.300
if you are on Android,
you should be able to go and

6
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.090
see if you can open up a web browser and
try to connect to the Internet.

7
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.920
So if you find a local Internet,
enter your password da da da da da.

8
00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.290
>> It's like any other Wi-Fi.

9
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.140
>> Yeah, see if you can open
up a webpage like Google or

10
00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.290
something like that just to test
if the Wi-Fi is working, and

11
00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.670
you'll be able to make sure you're
able to get an Internet connection.

12
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.740
Also, if you want, you can try and

13
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:47.390
test the Bluetooth by, if you have
an Apple iHome or something like that,

14
00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.870
you could try and connect the Bluetooth
to that, or something else that has

15
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.240
Bluetooth capabilities, just to make
sure they're all working correctly.

16
00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.242
>> Yeah, so we recommend, first of all,
if your Internet connection isn't working,

17
00:01:00.242 --> 00:01:03.646
you're gonna need to troubleshoot that,
possibly look at the forums.

18
00:01:03.646 --> 00:01:06.571
Or maybe your board is just
not working right now, and

19
00:01:06.571 --> 00:01:08.466
you might need to get another one.

20
00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:14.131
But if you get connected to the Internet,
cruise on over to YouTube,

21
00:01:14.131 --> 00:01:21.040
open up your favorite Katy Perry video,
and you know Bluetooth it to your iHome.

22
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.690
You should be able to hear it through your
iHome, it's just like your cell phone.

23
00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.690
I use my phone to listen to music
through my iHome, same concept.

24
00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.550
Another way to test out if your board is
working, just superficial way to test it

25
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.460
is, your HDMI is hooked into your screen.

26
00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.560
Your monitor, most likely, will have
some sort of speakers connected to it.

27
00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.970
The HDMI should be able to also push sound
through, which means, you know, play that

28
00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.850
video one more time and you should be
able to hear it through your monitor.

29
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.830
Another way to test it is,
even without using your micro SD

30
00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.550
card slot to boot into a flash for
another operating system,

31
00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:08.040
like I think I mentioned it earlier,
you can use it as extra storage as well.

32
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:12.660
So if you happen to be, and
this would be more so for Ubuntu, but

33
00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.610
if you happen to have a blank
micro SD card, pop that in there.

34
00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.880
Open up your files and it should
detect your micro SD card and allow

35
00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.560
you to store files on there, pull it out,
eject it, and transfer it somewhere else.

36
00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.900
These are just some simple ways to make
sure your board is functioning properly.

37
00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.110
>> Yeah, and
everything should be working ok.

38
00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.740
Especially if you just purchased
the board, but it never hurts to check and

39
00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.110
make, especially to play around
with it a bit and have some fun and

40
00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.980
get to know it a little better.
