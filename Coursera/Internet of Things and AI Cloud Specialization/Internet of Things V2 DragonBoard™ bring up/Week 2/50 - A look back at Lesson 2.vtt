00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:04.840
So we just wanna take a look back at
what we learned today in lesson two.

2
00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.030
First, we took you through like
choosing your operating system.

3
00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:10.980
It's an important choice because
you'll want to find something that

4
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.280
you're very comfortable with.

5
00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.350
There's a lot of good options.

6
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.894
You have Android, which is amazing,
Ubuntu, which is also-

7
00:00:16.894 --> 00:00:17.594
>> Equally amazing.

8
00:00:17.594 --> 00:00:18.294
>> Amazing.

9
00:00:18.294 --> 00:00:18.950
>> [LAUGH] Yeah.

10
00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.350
>> And then Windows 10, which is kinda
shines above, I'm just kidding man.

11
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.200
We haven't actually had a chance
to use Windows 10 yet, but

12
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.770
I'm sure it's gonna be amazing.

13
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.880
>> Yeah from what we've
read it looks really cool

14
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.620
>> Yeah it's a really awesome thing to be

15
00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:32.940
able to explore these
different operating systems.

16
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.620
Next, you've learned how to purchase
the DragonBoard, where to go to find it,

17
00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.010
how to buy it.

18
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.378
I think we even taught you
how to check your emails.

19
00:00:41.378 --> 00:00:42.450
>> [LAUGH]
>> But

20
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.070
then we also get to see a lot of
different benefits that you'll get

21
00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.040
from being able to go through this MOOC.

22
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.280
>> Yeah,
after you've purchased your board,

23
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.340
of course you're gonna wanna register, so
we kinda walk you through that process.

24
00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.150
A little tedious, but
nonetheless, necessary I guess.

25
00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.810
>> Gotta get it done.

26
00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:59.110
>> Gotta get it done.

27
00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.150
Yeah, so get your documentations
through your registration process,

28
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.800
access to the forums,

29
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.740
special documentation through the Qualcomm
development network, developer network.

30
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.930
All sorts of cool stuff
that you'll have access to

31
00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.860
since you've registered your
board with these different sites.

32
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.770
>> Now that we have the board and we have
it registered, we have an operating system

33
00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.700
on it that we like, we're just
about ready to get started with it.

34
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.200
>> Oh yeah.
