00:00:03.462 --> 00:00:04.199
In this module,

2
00:00:04.199 --> 00:00:07.792
I'm going to tell you a little bit about
the history of the DragonBoard 410c.

3
00:00:07.792 --> 00:00:13.984
The DragonBoard 410c is
not our first attempt at

4
00:00:13.984 --> 00:00:19.172
creating a board based on a cellphone SoC.

5
00:00:19.172 --> 00:00:22.540
In fact,
it's the seventh generation of board.

6
00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.190
Each generation of board has gotten a
little bit smaller, a little bit cleaner,

7
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.110
a little bit easier to use.

8
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:33.390
And this one is physically the smallest,
but also the easiest to use because

9
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.380
we've pared down the features to just
the features you can really use.

10
00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:43.041
So our original DragonBoards were
approximately ten inches by ten inches

11
00:00:43.041 --> 00:00:48.090
square, with a small module still bigger
than the DragonBoard stacked on top.

12
00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:55.070
As we refined each generation, we put more
and more features into the DragonBoard or

13
00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.760
what we called DragonBoard's then.

14
00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.670
And they became very expensive,
starting at $500 for

15
00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.220
the first generation up to $1,000 and
$1,500.

16
00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.080
We realized you didn't
need all of those things.

17
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.080
So we already knew that we needed to
build a pared-down DragonBoard to make it

18
00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.520
accessible to as many people as possible.

19
00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.930
And this is when we started looking
at the work that Linaro was doing,

20
00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.115
and how they were defining
a standardized footprint.

21
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.542
So the teams inside Qualcomm said,
we will design a board

22
00:01:32.542 --> 00:01:38.531
based on the 410 SoC to exactly
work with the 96Boards spec.

23
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.656
And we worked very diligently on finding
what all the components' need would be,

24
00:01:45.656 --> 00:01:50.043
and how we would bring all of
the features of the 410c into

25
00:01:50.043 --> 00:01:53.232
Linaro's ecosystem and Linaro's spec.

26
00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.445
So as you can see when
you're looking at the board,

27
00:01:56.445 --> 00:02:01.620
Linaro wrote a mechanical specification,
which is on your screen.

28
00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.470
And the board looks exactly like
the mechanical specification.

29
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.440
The locations of all the connectors are
standardized across all the Linaro boards.

30
00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.355
And that allows you to make
sure that everything you

31
00:02:16.355 --> 00:02:21.910
build will work with any DragonBoard or
any Linaro board, including

32
00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:27.020
future generations of DragonBoard and none
of the older generations, unfortunately.

33
00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:33.083
So as we worked with Linaro in building
up the DragonBoard specification,

34
00:02:33.083 --> 00:02:38.581
the original specification was written and
we designed the board.

35
00:02:38.581 --> 00:02:43.784
And in the process of designing the board,
we found problems with the specification,

36
00:02:43.784 --> 00:02:48.776
things that just couldn't work the way
the specification was written, and things

37
00:02:48.776 --> 00:02:53.580
we needed to add to the specification to
bring out all of the features of the SoC.

38
00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.819
So the specification and
the board design were iterative.

39
00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:59.550
They were written together
at the same time.

40
00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.600
And when you read the specification,
you can find a lot of details, but

41
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.470
you don't always think of
everything that's going on.

42
00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.420
And when you do a detailed design, you're
constantly looking at the specification

43
00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.090
and making sure that your detailed
design matches the specification.

44
00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.877
So that's why the creation of
the first DragonBoard from Linaro,

45
00:03:19.877 --> 00:03:25.550
the 410c, was an important step to
validating the Linaro specification.

46
00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.460
The final part of this
section is the resources.

47
00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.850
Again, we have
the Qualcomm Developer Network,

48
00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.058
which is constantly changing and
new things are being added.

49
00:03:37.058 --> 00:03:39.917
Particularly interesting
is the projects page,

50
00:03:39.917 --> 00:03:44.170
where you can take a look at things
people have built using a DragonBoard.

51
00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.390
We also have a 96Boards specification, and

52
00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:52.760
we have the 96Boards
GitHub with more details.

53
00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.790
Hopefully, these will inspire you
to building your own projects.
