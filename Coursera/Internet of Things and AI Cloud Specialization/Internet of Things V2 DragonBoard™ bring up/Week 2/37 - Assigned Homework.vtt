In this little video,

2
00:00:01.605 --> 00:00:03.875
I'm going to give you a homework assignment.

3
00:00:03.875 --> 00:00:09.690
Your assignment is to purchase or get a DragonBoard 410 in front of you,

4
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.180
load an operating system,

5
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.100
connect a mouse and a keyboard,

6
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:19.005
connect a HDMI display or your TV in your living room,

7
00:00:19.005 --> 00:00:23.160
and bring it up so that you can see everything running,

8
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.690
and realize that you have a full computer in front of you.

9
00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:32.920
This should take you probably an hour or two to find the image that you want,

10
00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.025
transfer the image to an SD card or to the board,

11
00:00:36.025 --> 00:00:39.640
and get everything connected and learn how to get it running.

12
00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.850
Hopefully, this isn't too large an assignment but is an important assignment.

13
00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.000
It's the first step to getting your DragonBoard running.
