1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.145
So far in this course we have talked about the 96Boards ecosystem,

2
00:00:06.145 --> 00:00:11.210
we have talked about DragonBoard and how the ecosystem enables a wide variety of users.

3
00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.335
It enables not just your hobbyists,

4
00:00:13.335 --> 00:00:16.099
but it also enables industry professionals.

5
00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:19.010
If you want to work on a product,

6
00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.380
this is a good platform that enables you to

7
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.605
visualize and not only to visualize but to commercialize your product.

8
00:00:26.605 --> 00:00:29.120
So in this section we'll talk a little bit about verticals,

9
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.435
what verticals you might be working with,

10
00:00:31.435 --> 00:00:41.990
and how the ecosystem and the 96Boards DragonBoard 410c enables a real part to product.

11
00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:46.531
So you might be working on various verticals.

12
00:00:46.531 --> 00:00:47.580
You might be hobbyist,

13
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:48.710
you might be working from home,

14
00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.361
or you might be an industry professional working in one of these verticals.

15
00:00:52.361 --> 00:00:56.045
You might be working with robots, drones, compute,

16
00:00:56.045 --> 00:00:59.120
automation, industry automation, you might be

17
00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.205
working with automotive environment and so on.

18
00:01:02.205 --> 00:01:04.320
So the verticals keep going on and on and on.

19
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:11.490
You might come across something that is very specific to your vertical.

20
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.000
And we are going to take a few moments talking about

21
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.060
how not only the 96Boards' ecosystem but also the DragonBoard

22
00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.805
410c enables you to kind of commercialize your product,

23
00:01:22.805 --> 00:01:27.015
not just have a proof of concept in hand.

24
00:01:27.015 --> 00:01:29.480
I want to touch real quick on one

25
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.940
vertical that's not really mentioned here but is just as

26
00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.640
important at least in

27
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.865
the sense that maybe it's not even considered a vertical but the maker space.

28
00:01:37.865 --> 00:01:39.785
And so makers aren't really listed here,

29
00:01:39.785 --> 00:01:43.513
but makers make up a huge part of the community.

30
00:01:43.513 --> 00:01:48.230
And as a maker if you ever come across something that you're developing,

31
00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.175
something that you say, "Oh, you know what?

32
00:01:50.175 --> 00:01:51.895
I'm just going to go do this myself,

33
00:01:51.895 --> 00:01:54.295
DIY," you're one of those DIY makers,

34
00:01:54.295 --> 00:01:56.165
but in the process you say,

35
00:01:56.165 --> 00:01:58.990
"Wow, this is a great idea.

36
00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.505
I want to find a way to bring this to market.

37
00:02:01.505 --> 00:02:03.180
What vertical did you-."

38
00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.790
This is where you kind of start bringing

39
00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.020
this whole video and why we're talking about this.

40
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.300
You are the maker and you figured something out that's really cool.

41
00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.365
What vertical are you tackling?

42
00:02:12.365 --> 00:02:14.610
And then how can,

43
00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.400
what we're going to talk about in a second,

44
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.980
Qualcomm or Arrow or any of these big industry partners or even yourself,

45
00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.960
how can you bring that to market,

46
00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.862
so how can you turn it into a product and bring it to market?

47
00:02:26.862 --> 00:02:28.382
Yeah, that goes into our next slide.

48
00:02:28.382 --> 00:02:30.530
So basically when we talk about the DragonBoard 410c,

49
00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.540
that has a Snapdragon 410e processor,

50
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.130
and we touched a little bit on this in the earlier videos in the course.

51
00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:44.381
But essentially 410c when we talk about DragonBoard 410c c stands for community effort,

52
00:02:44.381 --> 00:02:47.201
and what that means is Qualcomm with

53
00:02:47.201 --> 00:02:51.933
the Snapdragon 410e part is working very closely with Arrow,

54
00:02:51.933 --> 00:02:55.025
with all the component manufacturers of

55
00:02:55.025 --> 00:02:58.347
all the components that go on the DragonBoard 410c.

56
00:02:58.347 --> 00:03:00.965
They came together, collaborated,

57
00:03:00.965 --> 00:03:04.775
and contributed towards this awesome community platform

58
00:03:04.775 --> 00:03:07.023
that we are talking about right now.

59
00:03:07.023 --> 00:03:09.688
And as we talked about,

60
00:03:09.688 --> 00:03:12.467
so difference between 410c and 410e,

61
00:03:12.467 --> 00:03:20.107
so it has the APQ8016 application processor from Qualcomm and e stands for extended life.

62
00:03:20.107 --> 00:03:21.695
So when we talk about extended life,

63
00:03:21.695 --> 00:03:26.575
depending on the vertical that you are involved with,

64
00:03:26.575 --> 00:03:28.796
product lifecycle really matters.

65
00:03:28.796 --> 00:03:31.670
If you have a part which is only supported for a couple of years,

66
00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:37.530
you might not be able to end up creating a product that has a good lifecycle.

67
00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.015
In a lot of different verticals, for example healthcare,

68
00:03:40.015 --> 00:03:44.480
just a certification process is so long that if you have a part on

69
00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:50.095
your product which is not supported for an extended lifecycle,

70
00:03:50.095 --> 00:03:55.055
you're not going to have a reliable product because just the fact that you have to get it

71
00:03:55.055 --> 00:04:00.306
certified for a whole bunch of compliance for that vertical,

72
00:04:00.306 --> 00:04:03.730
you might end up missing the lifecycle.

73
00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.260
Yeah, I mean going into something complex like

74
00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.425
medical but also going into something simple like

75
00:04:09.425 --> 00:04:15.860
maybe a gateway to a group of trash cans or lightbulbs in a smart city.

76
00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:22.010
I mean you want your product running the Snapdragon 410e chipset to be

77
00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.640
stationary in an industrial setting for a long period

78
00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.570
of time without the need of tampering or messing with it of any sort.

79
00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:34.880
So I mean the fact that it's supported for such a long time allows people

80
00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:40.745
to develop around these environments and cater to this big IoT boom that's coming up.

81
00:04:40.745 --> 00:04:42.155
So when we say such a long time,

82
00:04:42.155 --> 00:04:43.918
it's actually 10 years, so it's supported to 2025.

83
00:04:43.918 --> 00:04:45.370
Yeah, 10 years. That's a long time for it.

84
00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:50.165
So it got launched 2015 and it's going to be supported till 2025,

85
00:04:50.165 --> 00:04:53.075
and as part of the other ongoing support for

86
00:04:53.075 --> 00:04:57.050
IoT space and extended longevity on different parts,

87
00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.911
we also have some other products

88
00:05:00.911 --> 00:05:03.500
which Qualcomm is going to

89
00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.490
identify for extended life and 410 is just one piece of the puzzle.

90
00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:08.783
Yes.

91
00:05:08.783 --> 00:05:11.169
So when we talked a little bit about verticals,

92
00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:16.040
you could be doing a whole lot of different,

93
00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:20.925
you could belong to any of those verticals that we had in one of the previous slides.

94
00:05:20.925 --> 00:05:24.300
We are just going to take one of those verticals and break it down to

95
00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:29.960
just kind of visualize how fragmented the vertical space gets.

96
00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.255
So if you just talk about industrial IoT,

97
00:05:32.255 --> 00:05:34.785
you can be even under industrial IoT umbrella.

98
00:05:34.785 --> 00:05:36.280
You can have industrial gateways,

99
00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.875
you can have home automations,

100
00:05:37.875 --> 00:05:41.365
energy and metering, you can have asset tracking, so forth and so on.

101
00:05:41.365 --> 00:05:43.680
So it gets very,

102
00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.130
very fragmented when you're trying to build a product and

103
00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:50.910
it just the process of identifying a part

104
00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:59.110
that is geared towards that particular vertical can be a good Google search for somebody.

105
00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:02.615
Rajan, I'm trying to think of what you would call a vertical inside of a vertical.

106
00:06:02.615 --> 00:06:05.765
It's like vertical squared.

107
00:06:05.765 --> 00:06:08.850
So I mean, yes, like industrial IOT and then you have

108
00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:14.010
all these different spaces that you can work in. So yes, sorry.

109
00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:17.765
Yes. So how does Snapdragon

110
00:06:17.765 --> 00:06:20.692
or a DragonBoard kind of support all of these different verticals?

111
00:06:20.692 --> 00:06:24.355
When we talk about these verticals and then verticals within verticals,

112
00:06:24.355 --> 00:06:25.680
how does it support?

113
00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.445
In the end, any vertical you are working with,

114
00:06:28.445 --> 00:06:32.370
you basically have certain requirements for your product.

115
00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:34.680
You need to have certain compute power,

116
00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.510
you need to have a certain amount of connectivity,

117
00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:38.610
whether that's Wi-Fi connectivity or

118
00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:43.185
cellular connectivity or some other low range RF connectivity,

119
00:06:43.185 --> 00:06:48.525
you would need to have integrated processing engines like a CPU,

120
00:06:48.525 --> 00:06:53.265
or you might need to have multimedia support on the product,

121
00:06:53.265 --> 00:06:56.560
and that's where something like a DragonBoard

122
00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.760
410C and a Snapdragon platform comes into picture,

123
00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:04.905
where it can support a lot of different requirements like those.

124
00:07:04.905 --> 00:07:06.835
Great support to those requirements,

125
00:07:06.835 --> 00:07:13.050
you can basically dig the same platform and use it for all of these different verticals.

126
00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:16.510
But then also, are you going to touch on the kind of the ecosystem around it.

127
00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:18.100
Because I mean, you're saying,

128
00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:22.380
that the Snapdragon in itself is the development platform.

129
00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:25.200
But now you get situations which I mean,

130
00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:27.975
in the theme of this lesson is the mezzanines, right?

131
00:07:27.975 --> 00:07:30.735
And for instance, let's just call out right here.

132
00:07:30.735 --> 00:07:32.990
I don't know, D3 Engineering's camera mezzanine, right?

133
00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:37.605
So you're developing on a vertical that requires some sort of use of the camera, right?

134
00:07:37.605 --> 00:07:42.375
Well now, you want to use the Snapdragon 410E processor,

135
00:07:42.375 --> 00:07:47.897
that chipset, but you also used the D3 mezzanine in your development process.

136
00:07:47.897 --> 00:07:50.065
So what happens after that?

137
00:07:50.065 --> 00:07:53.845
When we go through the development process we will touch on that a little bit,

138
00:07:53.845 --> 00:07:57.040
but like you mentioned, the ecosystem really enables the developers.

139
00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:02.900
When we're talking about being able to kind of cut down on those development cycles,

140
00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:05.235
I think we have a point on the slide which is

141
00:08:05.235 --> 00:08:09.587
basically rapid developing cycles and optimized technologies.

142
00:08:09.587 --> 00:08:15.960
Building a product which you can do a proof of concept

143
00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:18.290
and take it to market with

144
00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:23.085
a short development cycle is really important for some of these products,

145
00:08:23.085 --> 00:08:27.525
especially in this fast-paced technology environment.

146
00:08:27.525 --> 00:08:30.450
Every year products are being upgraded,

147
00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:32.635
every year new technology comes out.

148
00:08:32.635 --> 00:08:36.700
With that said, the ecosystem really does help,

149
00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:40.485
kind of, not only cut down the development cycle,

150
00:08:40.485 --> 00:08:43.332
but also make a very scalable product.

151
00:08:43.332 --> 00:08:48.270
In terms of the development cycle and being able to take something like

152
00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:51.885
a DragonBoard from a development platform

153
00:08:51.885 --> 00:08:54.570
to an actual product which can be commercialized,

154
00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:57.970
it really enables a developers and be,

155
00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:00.470
it walks them through the entire process.

156
00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:04.840
In terms of the actual development cycle rate,

157
00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:08.200
you have the development platform.

158
00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:10.180
You start working with the development platform,

159
00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:11.775
you start working on your concept,

160
00:09:11.775 --> 00:09:15.010
even if you're a hobbyist or working out of your home,

161
00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:17.200
you have a good concept, you think it's

162
00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:20.765
a million dollar concept and you want to start building it,

163
00:09:20.765 --> 00:09:23.040
so DragonBoard is a very good place to start.

164
00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:26.570
Once you have that proof of concept done on the DragonBoard,

165
00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:28.435
using the mezzanine ecosystem,

166
00:09:28.435 --> 00:09:32.080
you could be targeting a wide variety of verticals,

167
00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:36.280
and you could identify a mezzanine that is catered towards that vertical,

168
00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:40.175
or you could end up creating your own mezzanine for that particular vertical.

169
00:09:40.175 --> 00:09:45.385
Once you have that proof of concept with the DragonBoard and the mezzanine ecosystem,

170
00:09:45.385 --> 00:09:51.460
you would really want to do is take that and do a prototype off of it.

171
00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:55.910
Now, you can consider the DragonBoard and the mezzanine board as a prototype,

172
00:09:55.910 --> 00:10:02.950
but what you would really want to do is do your own design.

173
00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:07.090
With that said, with the Snapdragon platform,

174
00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:12.925
what that enables is there's a lot of vendors available which offer the same platform,

175
00:10:12.925 --> 00:10:16.933
the Snapdragon 410E as a SOMs and SBC.

176
00:10:16.933 --> 00:10:20.030
DragonBoard 410C, like we've talked about,

177
00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:21.925
it's a 96Boards ecosystem board,

178
00:10:21.925 --> 00:10:25.330
but it has a lot of different components like the high speed and low speed connectors.

179
00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:31.705
So when you build your proof of concept on a DragonBoard,

180
00:10:31.705 --> 00:10:34.200
you might have to do something with computer vision,

181
00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:36.615
you might end up using the D3 camera mezzanine,

182
00:10:36.615 --> 00:10:38.200
and so forth and so on.

183
00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:40.450
But you might not need some of the components.

184
00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:43.315
You might not need USB connectors,

185
00:10:43.315 --> 00:10:46.330
you might not need GPS on it.

186
00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:49.581
Yes, I want to dive in a little deeper on that because I've talked to several people,

187
00:10:49.581 --> 00:10:53.950
and it is literally kind of one of the biggest points I think,

188
00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:56.340
that should be taken away of your path to product.

189
00:10:56.340 --> 00:11:00.085
And it is essentially saying that, "Yes, okay.

190
00:11:00.085 --> 00:11:01.505
You build a prototype.

191
00:11:01.505 --> 00:11:05.725
Maybe you get 10 or 20 or 50 DragonBoards,

192
00:11:05.725 --> 00:11:08.050
and you practiced, and you build out your prototype,

193
00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:11.180
and you tested in your own closed world."

194
00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:13.390
But by the time you really want to

195
00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:16.581
execute this and you're building thousands of these things,

196
00:11:16.581 --> 00:11:18.697
tens of thousands of these things,

197
00:11:18.697 --> 00:11:22.775
one USB port is going to put a dent in your budget.

198
00:11:22.775 --> 00:11:24.805
You know, I mean, overall,

199
00:11:24.805 --> 00:11:26.725
if you have a hundred thousand units,

200
00:11:26.725 --> 00:11:29.985
and each USB port cost you ten cents,

201
00:11:29.985 --> 00:11:31.445
then you want to knock that off.

202
00:11:31.445 --> 00:11:34.330
So the derivative design process comes into play

203
00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:37.280
big time because if you can save a hundred thousand dollars,

204
00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:42.310
two hundred thousand dollars, a million dollars, then that's resources.

205
00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:44.830
That pays for a resource. That pays for a resource for a year.

206
00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:46.640
Yes. Engineer or someone that you can hire.

207
00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:49.540
I mean, those are the points that you need to

208
00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:52.810
kind of weigh when you're moving from your initial prototypes,

209
00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:57.460
your development phase, which is the evaluate and develop into your prototype phase,

210
00:11:57.460 --> 00:11:59.620
and then on into your commercialization.

211
00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:03.860
You want to knock off all these unnecessary things that are currently on the DragonBoard.

212
00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:07.070
And that's where the ecosystem really plays a part.

213
00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:12.310
There's a lot of vendors out there that have worked with the SnapDragon platform that are

214
00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:15.490
willing to kind of take

215
00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:18.730
up these new ideas and new concepts that the community is creating,

216
00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:20.479
and build on top of that.

217
00:12:20.479 --> 00:12:22.140
We have a quick link right there.

218
00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:24.845
We would encourage you guys to go take a look at that link,

219
00:12:24.845 --> 00:12:28.440
it's for the Snapdragon 410E landing page on the developer network.

220
00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:29.725
The link might change in future,

221
00:12:29.725 --> 00:12:32.628
but basically go to developer.qualcomm.com,

222
00:12:32.628 --> 00:12:34.030
look for the DragonBoard page,

223
00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:36.295
and click on the Snapdragon 410E part.

224
00:12:36.295 --> 00:12:44.005
And there you will see a lot of different options which would walk a developer or a maker

225
00:12:44.005 --> 00:12:47.470
through the process of creating

226
00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:49.410
your own prototype using

227
00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:53.170
the SOMs that are available or a single board computer that's available,

228
00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:54.940
and how to commercialize it.

229
00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:57.055
When you talk about commercialization,

230
00:12:57.055 --> 00:13:00.035
you have to go through some testing and certification,

231
00:13:00.035 --> 00:13:02.880
you have to put support into place,

232
00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:06.200
and all of those different factors that will,

233
00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:11.140
in the end, contribute towards a good user experience for the end product.

234
00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:13.650
There's a lot of people out there to help you too.

235
00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:15.935
I mean, you know, I would go as far to say as,

236
00:13:15.935 --> 00:13:18.130
you know, folks from Qualcomm, folks from Arrow,

237
00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:20.890
folks from these different distributors and manufacturers,

238
00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:23.253
they all want to be a part of this.

239
00:13:23.253 --> 00:13:26.010
You know, make sure you utilize your resources.

240
00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:29.190
Time to pause and reflect on the resources, right?

241
00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:33.010
I know 96Boards also has an initiative

242
00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:37.380
for different verticals along the lines of what we talked about.

243
00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:39.694
Yes, so I can kind of touch on that real quickly.

244
00:13:39.694 --> 00:13:40.805
You can see the link up there,

245
00:13:40.805 --> 00:13:42.040
it's on the resources page.

246
00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:44.665
Again, like Rajan says, pause, reflect,

247
00:13:44.665 --> 00:13:47.180
go explore those Snapdragon 410E pages,

248
00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:51.520
or the DragonBoard 410C page on Qualcomm developer network.

249
00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:54.925
Now, if you want to see some real life uses

250
00:13:54.925 --> 00:13:59.650
of kind of verticals that the 96Boards team has tried to tackle,

251
00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:01.550
as well as some other people in the community,

252
00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:10.105
you can go to this GitHub repository, 96Boards, or github.com/96boards-projects.

253
00:14:10.105 --> 00:14:12.175
It's an entire org actually,

254
00:14:12.175 --> 00:14:16.780
and inside the org you have different repositories that have been geared towards

255
00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:22.145
setting up foundational use cases around a variety of vertical markets.

256
00:14:22.145 --> 00:14:24.475
Now, what's the point of us doing this?

257
00:14:24.475 --> 00:14:28.615
Well, the point in general is to just show people that

258
00:14:28.615 --> 00:14:31.960
these baseline verticals can be

259
00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:36.280
approached and used for platforms like the DragonBoard 410C.

260
00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:38.005
Now, if you consume this,

261
00:14:38.005 --> 00:14:40.030
and you build on top of it,

262
00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:42.340
and you make something bigger, better,

263
00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:45.990
well then I mean, that's your first step to path the product.

264
00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:49.450
I mean, you consume the DragonBoard,

265
00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:52.180
you consume a mezzanine, a particular functionality,

266
00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:53.680
a market that you want to address,

267
00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:55.620
the vertical market that you want to address.

268
00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:57.980
You can go take a chunk of code,

269
00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:02.140
a chunk of open source stuff that has already been developed for you,

270
00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:04.255
that's open and ready for you to consume,

271
00:15:04.255 --> 00:15:06.490
and then make it unique,

272
00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:08.880
make it special for your use case.

273
00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:11.960
That's kind of what that projects org is there for.

274
00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:14.095
If you want to contribute it back,

275
00:15:14.095 --> 00:15:16.480
afterwards, that's always welcome as well.

276
00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:18.465
So I mean, again, open source.

277
00:15:18.465 --> 00:15:19.870
Yes. I would also like to add,

278
00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:22.615
in terms of consuming the DragonBoard and the mezzanine ecosystem,

279
00:15:22.615 --> 00:15:25.690
we talked a little bit about the mezzanine ecosystem and how

280
00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:29.395
it's open source and you can start building your hardware on top of that.

281
00:15:29.395 --> 00:15:31.870
But it's important to also mention that,

282
00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:34.570
when we're talking about derivative design,

283
00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:36.650
taking the DragonBoard, something like a DragonBoard,

284
00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:41.100
and moving towards using something like a system on module,

285
00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:46.230
the entire schematic for the DragonBoard is also available on Qualcomm developer network.

286
00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:47.980
So if you go to Qualcomm developer network,

287
00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:50.320
go to the DragonBoard 410C resources page,

288
00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:54.198
you can actually find the entire bill of materials for the DragonBoard,

289
00:15:54.198 --> 00:15:56.223
and the schematics and layouts for

290
00:15:56.223 --> 00:15:59.320
the DragonBoard is available for everybody to download.

291
00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:01.000
You can take that,

292
00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.020
you can do your own design,

293
00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:04.303
or you can identify something like a System-on-Module,

294
00:16:04.303 --> 00:16:06.301
which has the same part.

295
00:16:06.301 --> 00:16:09.730
And since you have done your software design on the DragonBoard and you

296
00:16:09.730 --> 00:16:13.479
use the same Snapdragon part just in a different form factor,

297
00:16:13.479 --> 00:16:18.180
just the System-on-Module, you do not have to reinvent your software code.

298
00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:21.610
So support for that is the same support for a SOM.

299
00:16:21.610 --> 00:16:28.030
It's just the reusing it in a different form factor to better suit the end product.

300
00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:31.270
It's very nice when companies do provide those bill of materials because

301
00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:34.945
you can see exactly what you want on your derivative design.

302
00:16:34.945 --> 00:16:36.130
And in a sense,

303
00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:39.100
where you can get it from and who's going to help you build it,

304
00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:42.295
so very, very nicely put.

305
00:16:42.295 --> 00:16:48.040
This concludes, as far as now, this video.

306
00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:50.695
But please, check out the next one.

307
00:16:50.695 --> 00:16:53.065
You are going to have some homework.

308
00:16:53.065 --> 00:16:57.980
So, we look forward to assigning that to you. Thank you.

309
00:16:57.980 --> 00:16:59.300
Thank you.
