00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.470
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:05.060
In this section we're gonna be going
over where our ADB protocol is located.

3
00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.402
So let's go ahead and go to a terminal.

4
00:00:07.402 --> 00:00:12.501
>> All right, so
we're gonna open up a new terminal,

5
00:00:12.501 --> 00:00:16.899
and currently we are in
our home directory.

6
00:00:16.899 --> 00:00:21.373
Now for me, my Android SDK,
where our ADB protocol or

7
00:00:21.373 --> 00:00:25.058
ADB is located is in
my development folder.

8
00:00:25.058 --> 00:00:29.756
So we're gonna change the directory
to that development folder, and

9
00:00:29.756 --> 00:00:34.530
from there we are gonna go to the Android
folder, we do a quick list, and

10
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.615
you see that you have your SDK.

11
00:00:36.615 --> 00:00:40.760
So we're gonna change
the directory to the SDK, and

12
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.525
from the SDK we want to change
the directory to the platform tools,

13
00:00:45.525 --> 00:00:48.700
platform-tools, and

14
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:54.350
here once you do a quick LS,
you see that we have ADB installed here.

15
00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.870
And whenever you want to use ADB with
a command line, you either have to be in

16
00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:04.090
the same directory as your ADB, or
if you want you can essentially

17
00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:07.950
call it from a different directory,
but you just have to reference it.

18
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.720
>> So in this case, since we're on a macro
Linux, they both using Unix environment.

19
00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.660
In order to execute ADB,
we're gonna go ahead and

20
00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.140
just type in ./adb, and
it should give us an error message.

21
00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.315
If we were on a Windows computer,
we just typed in adb and just press Enter.

22
00:01:25.315 --> 00:01:28.470
>> So, now that we know where ADB is,

23
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.120
let's go ahead and figure out what are
the different commands that we will use?

24
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.539
So, stay tuned in the next section.
