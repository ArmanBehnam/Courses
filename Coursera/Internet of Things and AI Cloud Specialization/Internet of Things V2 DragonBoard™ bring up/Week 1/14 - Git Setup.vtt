00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:04.500
Hey y'all, so in this section,
we'll be showing you how to set up Git.

2
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.870
So let's first dive in and
show you how to install Git.

3
00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:09.960
>> So if you're on a Linux computer,

4
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.480
most likely you're gonna be able to use
the Package Manager that comes with it.

5
00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.240
So if you're using the Linaro version on
a DragonBoard 410c, you can ahead and

6
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.300
use the command apt-get install git.

7
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.710
If you're using Fedora,
you could use yum install.

8
00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.860
Or of you're using Gentoo or
some other flavor of Linux,

9
00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.140
you can always use whatever
Package Manager they have there.

10
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.040
Now with Mac,
you're able to do it via two ways.

11
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.590
One, you can install
the Xcode Command Line Tool or

12
00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.240
alternatively, you can download Git
separately on the provided link.

13
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:44.630
And also with Windows, it's essentially
the same link for Mac as well.

14
00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.571
And if you want more information
on how to set it up,

15
00:00:47.571 --> 00:00:51.350
or rather how to download it and
the steps for installation,

16
00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.730
the More Info link will give you a better
detail as to what steps you need to take.

17
00:00:56.902 --> 00:00:58.750
>> All right, so
you have Git installed on your computer.

18
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.950
It would be really awesome if
you could somehow kinda link it

19
00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.900
to some sort of server online.

20
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.014
So you can let everybody
have access to it,

21
00:01:07.014 --> 00:01:09.436
as well as giving you your
own sense of security.

22
00:01:09.436 --> 00:01:13.964
Cuz if you just have code on your
computer and your computer goes boom,

23
00:01:13.964 --> 00:01:15.510
you lose all your code.

24
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.999
So it'd be nice if you could somewhere,
somehow put this code online.

25
00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.500
>> So what we recommend, these are on
the screen that you'll see are two of

26
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.820
the more popular Git servers.

27
00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.890
So the first is called Github, and

28
00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.750
usually Github is more
geared towards larger teams.

29
00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.767
And the only drawback if you
kind of perceive it that way,

30
00:01:39.767 --> 00:01:44.211
is that all your code and
all your repositories will be public.

31
00:01:44.211 --> 00:01:47.510
>> If you want you can have private
repositories, but it does cost money.

32
00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.610
I think it's $10 for every five
repositories or something like that.

33
00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.410
If you happen to have a .edu account, you
can actually get five free repositories

34
00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.370
for the duration of your college term.

35
00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:02.900
But otherwise, Github is again,
like Jacob said, very, very, very public.

36
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.741
>> There's also Bitbucket, and
usually Bitbucket is for smaller teams.

37
00:02:06.741 --> 00:02:11.327
And the benefit of having Bitbucket is
that all the repositories that you create

38
00:02:11.327 --> 00:02:13.230
will be private.

39
00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.831
And similar to the github.edu or
the educational discounts,

40
00:02:17.831 --> 00:02:22.730
Bitbucket also has a few
educational discounts for students.

41
00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.111
So whichever one your prefer,
just go ahead and check them out.

42
00:02:26.111 --> 00:02:29.770
>> For me personally, I like to have
Bitbucket there for any personal projects.

43
00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.881
I know I like having 10,
20 different projects at the same time.

44
00:02:33.881 --> 00:02:35.652
Obviously not working on it, but

45
00:02:35.652 --> 00:02:38.190
just being able to kind of go through and
see it.

46
00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.400
So Bitbucket is very, very attractive for
people that like having a lot of projects.

47
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.780
Whereas, I feel like if you
wanna somehow post your code,

48
00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.910
make it much more public, be more social,
I think Github is the way to go.

49
00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.360
>> Yeah, definitely agree with that.

50
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.480
>> All of our code will be
located on a Github repository,

51
00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.840
which will be provided to you in a link.

52
00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.430
So you can go ahead and grab all the code,
or look through it, on Github from there.

53
00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:03.971
>> And we'll see you in the next section.
