Hey everyone.

2
00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.320
So, in this video we
are going to talk about

3
00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.850
the different commands that you
can run on a Unix terminal.

4
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.810
So Randy here will start going
through some common ones here.

5
00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:16.030
>> So, some common ones,
some important ones would be LS.

6
00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:20.640
LS is just a command that lists everything
in the current directory you're in, and

7
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.630
cd allows you to change your directory so
you can move around.

8
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.200
Say you're in your home directory, you
want to see your documents, cd documents.

9
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.382
>> Right.
>> Another important

10
00:00:29.382 --> 00:00:32.099
one would be something like sudo and
sudo su.

11
00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.919
We covered those earlier
in the previous lesson.

12
00:00:34.919 --> 00:00:37.173
And that's basically
becoming a super user so

13
00:00:37.173 --> 00:00:40.930
you can execute commands that you
normally wouldn't be able to.

14
00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.177
>> Right.
>> And all these commands are common

15
00:00:43.177 --> 00:00:48.311
commands that we'll be going over or
we'll be using throughout the course.

16
00:00:48.311 --> 00:00:48.831
>> Yeah.

17
00:00:48.831 --> 00:00:53.412
>> So like we said,
if you can pause the video, look over it,

18
00:00:53.412 --> 00:00:58.630
maybe in the course later on you
might forget, just come back.

19
00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:59.392
>> Yes.
So make sure

20
00:00:59.392 --> 00:01:01.401
you get comfortable
using this at any time.

21
00:01:01.401 --> 00:01:06.601
And lastly, we have a website there,
ss64.com/bash.

22
00:01:06.601 --> 00:01:09.754
And, basically,
that website contains a very,

23
00:01:09.754 --> 00:01:13.670
very comprehensive list of all
the different Unix commands.

24
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.921
So, you can go on there and find the Unix
command for whatever you wanna do.

25
00:01:17.921 --> 00:01:20.110
>> Right, and
if you're not satisfied with one,

26
00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.011
you can check out the procedure documents,
and we'll have more resources for you.

27
00:01:24.011 --> 00:01:28.184
>> Yeah, and with that,
we'll wrap up the Unix commands video and

28
00:01:28.184 --> 00:01:30.360
we'll see you in the next video.
