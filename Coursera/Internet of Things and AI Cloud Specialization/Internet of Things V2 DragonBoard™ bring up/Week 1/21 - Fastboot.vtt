Hey everyone, welcome to this section.

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:09.290
Here we will be going over a super
brief introduction to what Fastboot is.

3
00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:16.100
>> A Fastboot is a protocol used to
essentially modify a flash file system

4
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.708
from a PC to some Android device utilizing
a USB connection or a serial connection.

5
00:00:21.708 --> 00:00:25.950
And actually Fastboot's this really really
nice protocol cause it actually makes

6
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:31.060
flashing very very easy, however it's also
a little dangerous because of how easy

7
00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:37.318
it is to flash files onto your
flash file on your android device.

8
00:00:37.318 --> 00:00:42.870
>> And you don't have to worry about
downloading Fastboot if you already have

9
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.900
Android STK installed because
it comes bundled with it and

10
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.094
in the next section we'll show you how
to boot the board into Fastboot so

11
00:00:51.094 --> 00:00:55.120
that you're able to use the Fastboot
commands on your host PC.

12
00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:57.600
We'll see you then.
