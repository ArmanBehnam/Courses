00:00:03.942 --> 00:00:06.690
Hello everyone and
welcome to this section.

2
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.660
Here if you are a Windows
user you need to do a few

3
00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:16.210
tweaks to your USB driver so
that your computer is able to use ADB.

4
00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:21.910
Now if you're a Mac and Linux user, you
can go ahead and skip to the next section.

5
00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:24.290
>> Right, so,
let's go ahead and get started.

6
00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:26.150
The first thing that you
need to do is go ahead and

7
00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.690
boot up your Android Studio,
as we have here.

8
00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:32.812
We're going to go ahead and create
a new Android Studio project, just so

9
00:00:32.812 --> 00:00:36.150
we get in there, so I'm just gonna go
ahead and click next all the way through.

10
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.520
Click finish.

11
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.120
The reason why we're starting
in Android Studio project is so

12
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.878
we can gain access to the SDK manager.

13
00:00:45.878 --> 00:00:49.520
Now, the SDK manager inside of Android
Studio is essentially where you go to

14
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.920
update your SDK and various other Android
tools such as downloading emulator

15
00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.510
images or any other
>> Different OS versions.

16
00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.880
>> Yeah, also I think there's a wearables
API in there and stuff like that.

17
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.472
So If you want to play around
with android specific stuff,

18
00:01:07.472 --> 00:01:10.669
SDK manager is definitely the way to go.

19
00:01:10.669 --> 00:01:14.088
So currently we're just waiting for
the project to open.

20
00:01:14.088 --> 00:01:15.434
All right.
So now if you notice,

21
00:01:15.434 --> 00:01:18.603
way up at the top here,
let me go ahead and maximize,

22
00:01:18.603 --> 00:01:21.860
we have this little guy
hiding inside a box.

23
00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:22.700
Go ahead and click that.

24
00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.325
As soon as it loads it should be

25
00:01:31.325 --> 00:01:36.157
its own little pop-up window.

26
00:01:36.157 --> 00:01:37.662
All right.

27
00:01:37.662 --> 00:01:41.486
So right now it's fetching
all the updates that we need,

28
00:01:41.486 --> 00:01:45.280
now notice that we have
a bunch of stuff checked off.

29
00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.135
What I'm gonna do real quick
is I'm just gonna ahead and

30
00:01:47.135 --> 00:01:50.350
de-select everything, since I don't
wanna install all this stuff.

31
00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.480
These are your Android images that
you would probably wanna install.

32
00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.500
I'm gonna keep scrolling down.

33
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.150
And here is a support library
that I'm gonna go ahead and

34
00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.450
remove, as well as a google USB driver.

35
00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.670
Now this is very important.

36
00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.230
The USB driver here is
the way you communicate

37
00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:11.940
between your android device and the phone.

38
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.340
So you're going to go ahead and install
this package, and then go ahead and

39
00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.950
accept the license and click install.

40
00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.481
So it should be a relatively fast install.

41
00:02:25.082 --> 00:02:28.540
Now, we're also gonna take note of where
our SDK is located, which is right here.

42
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.690
All right, so now I'm gonna go ahead and
close this and we can go out and

43
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.310
close Android Studio at
this moment in time.

44
00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.020
Next, I wanna go to that directory,
so what I'm gonna do.

45
00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:47.490
So, I'm gonna open up my computer,
go to C, programming, Android, and SDK.

46
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:55.533
All right, so now from here you wanna
go inside of your extras directory,

47
00:02:55.533 --> 00:02:59.750
go inside Google, and
you're gonna go inside USB driver.

48
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.680
Now, here there's a file
called android_winusb.inf.

49
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.160
I'm going to go ahead and open that,

50
00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:12.127
and I'm just going to use a simple
text editor such as Notepad ++.

51
00:03:12.127 --> 00:03:15.020
As you see here,

52
00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:19.290
there's a bunch of different headers
with a bunch of information.

53
00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.610
If we scroll down,
you'll notice this Google.ntx86

54
00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.180
has a bunch of gibberish-looking stuff,
as well as this .NTamd64.

55
00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:33.020
This is actually the information
that your USB driver uses in

56
00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:37.280
order to communicate via the inner device,
so we just need to simply modify it.

57
00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.480
Inside this text file I have
the information needed for

58
00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.410
the DragonBoard 410c.

59
00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:51.490
So what I'm going to do is I'm gonna go
ahead and click on this or drag this all.

60
00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:56.280
>> And do note that we will provide
the proper documentation for

61
00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.000
this, so
that you can reference it in case you're

62
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.870
unable to see all of the different
things that we're copying over.

63
00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.390
>> Yeah and by no means you should
type this up you should definitely go

64
00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:10.600
ahead and copy it.

65
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.080
So this first section you're
going to go ahead and

66
00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.360
find Google.NTX86 and I'm just gonna go
ahead and add it right at the bottom here.

67
00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:23.720
Next, I'm gonna go ahead and
grab this section, and

68
00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.840
I am failing today at copying text over.

69
00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.620
Actually a really huge skill,
not a lot of people have it.

70
00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.370
>> Happens to the best of us.

71
00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.890
>> So we're gonna go ahead and
click Enter here.

72
00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:38.180
And now we should have the necessary
information needed to update our

73
00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.740
USB driver.

74
00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.410
Sometimes this works automatically, other
times it doesn't, so let's go ahead and

75
00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:44.229
just make sure it does.

76
00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:47.710
Gonna go ahead and right click PC.

77
00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.741
We're gonna go to Manage.

78
00:04:54.082 --> 00:04:57.400
And essentially what we wanna do is
we wanna go to our Device Manager.

79
00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.788
Now, we won't see anything here right now,
so

80
00:05:01.788 --> 00:05:04.151
what we need to do is plug in a USB cable.

81
00:05:04.151 --> 00:05:10.381
So what you want to do is make
sure your Dragon Board is on and

82
00:05:10.381 --> 00:05:16.751
you want to go ahead and
connect the OTG port to the USB port.

83
00:05:16.751 --> 00:05:17.790
>> And we're good.

84
00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:19.850
>> All right.
So we should have it connected.

85
00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:24.070
I'm just going to do a quick scan and
notice here that this popped up right now,

86
00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:27.470
other devices and it says Android,
Android, Android, which is perfect.

87
00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.120
Just what we needed.

88
00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.120
So what we want to do is we're going to
go ahead and just click the first one and

89
00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.500
say update driver software.

90
00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.398
We're going to browse
through the computer and

91
00:05:37.398 --> 00:05:41.470
we're just going to go ahead and
browse to where that folder is.

92
00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:45.601
So if we go down to SDK down here,

93
00:05:45.601 --> 00:05:50.660
go into extras, google, USB driver.

94
00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:52.680
And that's perfect,
that's exactly what we want.

95
00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.820
Press okay, and press next.

96
00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:01.710
Now sometimes you'll get this error

97
00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.890
that either means that your
driver is either updated or

98
00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:11.940
that you might need to configure some
settings in your operating system.

99
00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:17.360
So at this moment in time, we are going to
assume that our software is updated, and

100
00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.490
if you run into a lot of
issues you can go ahead and

101
00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:20.920
reference them inside of our document.

102
00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:24.950
So, as a result,
we know how to update our USB drivers and

103
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:26.140
we hope to see you in the next section.
