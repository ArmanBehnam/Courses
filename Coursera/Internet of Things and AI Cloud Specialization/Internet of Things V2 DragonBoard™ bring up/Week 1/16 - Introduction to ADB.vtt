00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:01.680
Welcome everyone.

2
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.720
We're gonna be going over
what ADB is in this section.

3
00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:13.160
>> ADB is a client and server program and
it's comprised of three components.

4
00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.790
The client, the server and the daemon.

5
00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.430
The client is essentially
what runs on your PC/host.

6
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.360
The server is this program
that kind of manages or

7
00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.130
facilitates the communication
between the board and your host.

8
00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:32.140
And, lastly, the daemon which is,
essentially, just the background process

9
00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:38.469
in the divisor emulator that
will connect with your host.

10
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.266
>> So, ADB is mainly basically a bridge,

11
00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:47.700
as Jacob said, between your
Android device and your host PC.

12
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.700
Now, for our purposes we're going to be
using ADB mostly on the command line and

13
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.500
basically whenever you think ADB you're
going to be thinking command line.

14
00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.910
However, because ADB is a way to
communicate to your Android device,

15
00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.450
various different applications
use it on their internals.

16
00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:09.560
For instance, Android studio uses the ADB
server as well as various different

17
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.920
protocols part of the ADB to
connect to your Android device.

18
00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.880
So on the inside it's actually using ADB
but it's just covered up in nice little

19
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.580
buttons that you can go ahead and
click around.

20
00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.660
>> And with that,
we'll see you in the next section.
