00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:02.970
Hey everyone.

2
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.410
So in this video we're going to be
going over frequent terminology.

3
00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:09.500
Terminology that we will be using
throughout the course here.

4
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.000
>> So first we have the board.

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.730
So that's just we're gonna use the word
the board, instead of saying DragonBoard

6
00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.580
410c all the time
>> And the next thing we have is boot,

7
00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:23.900
which is just starting your board.

8
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:24.590
>> Right.

9
00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.860
And oftentimes you're going to say
something like open up your terminal,

10
00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.830
the terminal is basically a command line.

11
00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.900
So on Windows, if you're running Windows,

12
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.360
you're gonna use the MS-DOS
command prompt, or

13
00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.380
on the Unix system you're gonna use the
terminal that comes with the Unix system.

14
00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.550
>> The next thing we have
is the Android Studio.

15
00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.750
We'll be doing a lot of programs on
Android Studio, a lot of applications.

16
00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.110
So it's basically an IDE.

17
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.930
If you remember back
from the previous videos,

18
00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.240
it's an Integrated
Development Environment.

19
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.750
And then the next thing we
have here is dip switches.

20
00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.150
Dip switches are switches on
the back of the dragon board.

21
00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.360
And these switches will have to
be configured in a certain way to

22
00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.300
boot the board up in different methods.

23
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.160
>> Yeah,
we'll go over that in a later module, so

24
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.420
don't worry about it too much right now.

25
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.440
>> Right, thank you Randy.

26
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.780
And the next thing you have is the script,
which is actually an executable file.

27
00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.910
We'll explain more about
that in coming modules.

28
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.558
And it's basically a script that will
make our life easier, basically.

29
00:01:18.558 --> 00:01:21.005
>> [LAUGH] So
the next thing we have is fastboot.

30
00:01:21.005 --> 00:01:23.880
So that's a way to install
an operating system,

31
00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.740
using your computer instead
of something like an SD card.

32
00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.305
And finally, we have Flashing,
which is the process we're gonna use,

33
00:01:33.305 --> 00:01:37.950
or call overwriting an existing OS with
say, another OS, or maybe the same one.

34
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.580
Because maybe your
original OS was messed up.

35
00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:41.110
>> Right.

36
00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.880
And so with that,
that concludes Frequent Terminology.

37
00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.690
And
>> like the other videos,

38
00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.660
feel free to pause at any time and
look back at these definitions.

39
00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:51.640
Familiarize yourself with this.

40
00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.630
And we'll see you in the next video.
