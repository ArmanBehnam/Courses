Hey everyone.
In this section we're going to be going

2
00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.600
over where to find our Fastboot protocol.

3
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.940
>> So let's go right into our screen.

4
00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:11.080
So currently I am in my home directory,
and

5
00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.760
I'm gonna change to
the directory of my Android SDK.

6
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.740
So that's conveniently located at
development, Android, and then SDK.

7
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:28.480
Now, here from the SDK you want to
go to your platform-tools, here, and

8
00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.700
a quick LS will show us that
Fastboot is located right here.

9
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:40.100
As you can see, ADB and
Fastboot are within the same location.

10
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.800
>> So, whenever you download Android SEK,
ADB and Fastboot come bundled with it.

11
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.140
So it's a really nice little package to
have instead of having to hunt down ADB

12
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:49.720
and Fastboot.

13
00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.790
So, in the next session we'll go ahead and
actually give you a few commands that

14
00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.460
are going to be commonly used when you're
flashing files onto the Dragon Board.
