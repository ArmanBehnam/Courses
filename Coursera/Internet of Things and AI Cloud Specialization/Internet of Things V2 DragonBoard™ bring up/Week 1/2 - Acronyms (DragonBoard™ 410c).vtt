00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.670
Greetings everyone, here we are gonna
go over acronyms that we will use and

2
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.310
we will see a lot that has
to do with the DragonBoard.

3
00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.850
>> So the three main
categories of acronyms that we

4
00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:17.870
are gonna go over is pins, the ports, and

5
00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:21.865
the components and Randy here will
start explaining the pins here.

6
00:00:21.865 --> 00:00:22.670
>> Mm-hm.

7
00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.260
So these are the list of the six
pins that appear on DragonBoard

8
00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.310
on the expansion headers.

9
00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:33.470
In this course we'll or in this,
in the following course

10
00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:38.920
we'll mostly be going over the GPIO pins,
the general purpose input/output.

11
00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.160
We'll touch upon the other ones, but like
I said we'll mostly be using the GPIO.

12
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.660
>> Right.

13
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.308
>> The following, so ports,

14
00:00:46.308 --> 00:00:51.470
there's here this is the HDMI port this
is use to you know, connect your monitor.

15
00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.970
We have two USB ports on
the DragonBoard which is

16
00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.070
to connect any external peripheral
such as a keyboard or mouse.

17
00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.180
We have the Micro USB right here.

18
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.330
This is used to connect your DragonBoard
to your computer so you can, I don't know,

19
00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.650
upload an application or something.

20
00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:07.500
>> Right.
>> And finally,

21
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.540
we have the DC power adapter,
which is located right here.

22
00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.794
For this board we'll mostly be
using the 12 volt power supply?

23
00:01:14.794 --> 00:01:16.040
>> Mm-hm, right.

24
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.440
That's about it, right there?

25
00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.490
>> Yes.
And so the last thing we're gonna touch

26
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.110
here is the components and as you can see,
we have a bunch of components here,

27
00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.260
the DragonBoard is pretty powerful.

28
00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.970
Two things I wanna touch upon
here is the first thing is WiFi.

29
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.810
WiFi doesn't really stand for anything.

30
00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:38.330
It was kind of a branding term that beat
out the IEEE 802.11 on standard there.

31
00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.340
And then the second very important
thing I wanna touch upon is the ARM,

32
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.950
which stands for Advanced RISC Machine.

33
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.930
This board is special because
it actually runs the call com

34
00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:52.300
Snap Dragon Quad Core ARM cortex
processor at 1.2 GigaHertz p.

35
00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.900
It's a very powerful board and
these are the different components.

36
00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.840
And so you can pause the video at any time
here and read though everything here, and

37
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.250
we'll see you on the next video when
we go over more general acronyms.
