Hey everyone.
In this section we're going to be going

2
00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.070
over how to boot your
Dragon Board into Fastboot.

3
00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:11.410
Now, there's two easy ways to do it,
one via the software in through ADB,

4
00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.770
and the other's through using the actual
switches on the Dragon Board itself.

5
00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:18.730
So let's go ahead and
do the software first.

6
00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:19.650
>> Sure.

7
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.500
So what you first want to do is you want
to be in the same directory as your ADB.

8
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.838
So we're gonna go ahead,
and we're already there.

9
00:00:27.838 --> 00:00:34.540
Click that ./adb devices, and
you see that it's connected via the USB.

10
00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.680
So then what we want to do is we
want to boot this into Fastboot, so

11
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.610
we're gonna do ./adb reboot,
and then type in bootloader.

12
00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.570
Okay, go ahead and enter.

13
00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:53.200
And what this should do is, it should
restart the Dragon Board into Fastboot.

14
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.876
Now, to check to see if it is in Fastboot,
what you can do is issue this following

15
00:00:57.876 --> 00:01:03.090
Fastboot command, ./fastboot devices.

16
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.500
As you can see here, the same
device in now running in Fastboot.

17
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.430
>> So now,
that's how to do it from the software end.

18
00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.680
Now let's go ahead and
do it from the hardware end.

19
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.250
So I'm gonna go ahead and disconnect.

20
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.770
So first you want to make sure that your
board is disconnected and not powered on.

21
00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.270
Right?
>> Mm-hm.

22
00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.960
>> Next, we're going to take some sort of
wire or some sort of small object, it can

23
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.530
be anything, so long as you can actually
click on these little buttons here.

24
00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.960
>> And make sure it is not charged.

25
00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.210
>> Yes,
make it sure it's a non-static item.

26
00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.480
>> So what you wanna do is you wanna
find this minus button right here.

27
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.370
It should be the the right-most switch
if you look at it from this way.

28
00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.485
So looking at a little better view, it's
gonna be this little button right there.

29
00:01:52.485 --> 00:01:53.480
>> Mm-hm.

30
00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.600
>> So I'm gonna go ahead and
hold that down.

31
00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.960
Next what Jacob's gonna do is he's gonna
go ahead and plug it into the board.

32
00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.820
So now, what you wanna do is you
wanna kind of hold it down for

33
00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.290
a little bit while at the same time a good
method is to go back to the screen and

34
00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.460
check to see if Fastboot devices is on.

35
00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.670
>> All right,
we're gonna issue the same command.

36
00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.410
>> And we're in fast boot.

37
00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.100
So we effectively have two
different methods, one via ADVB,

38
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.460
and the other via the minus button,
the hardware.

39
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.230
So, hope to see you guys in the next
section where we go a little bit more on

40
00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:31.647
where to find Fastboot itself.
