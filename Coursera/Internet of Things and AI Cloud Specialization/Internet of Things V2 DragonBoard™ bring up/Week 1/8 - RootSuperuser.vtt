00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:03.740
You know what say Ukrish?

2
00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:05.700
What do they say Randy?

3
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.500
With great power comes great
responsibility, you may not be Superman or

4
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.420
Batman, but
hey you can become a super user.

5
00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.540
On a computer.
So what is a super user?

6
00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.740
So let's start with how
to become a super user.

7
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.450
So you gotta open up your terminal and
some machines you usually do su.

8
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.350
Other machines,
you do sudo su to become superuser.

9
00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:29.650
You might have to put in your password,
something like that.

10
00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.490
>> Yeah.
And a quick point I wanna make here is

11
00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:36.220
that sudo su,
being able to run commands as a superuser.

12
00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.310
It only works Linux systems.

13
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:42.150
With a Windows system, you won't be able
to do that to the Windows command prompt.

14
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.050
The command won't be recognized.

15
00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.640
>> What's so important about this, right?

16
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.540
So superuser, or
more commonly known as a root user.

17
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.130
So you've probably heard of like
rooting your Android device or

18
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:54.200
something like that.

19
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.730
Basically allows you to modify every file,
every program you have in your computer.

20
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.090
So normally you wouldn't be able to
touch like operating system files, but

21
00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:06.749
under superuser mode,
you can just do whatever you want.

22
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.510
Change stuff yeah.

23
00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.590
Like we said in the first part with
great power comes great responsibility.

24
00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:20.020
So because you are a super user you can
accidentally delete an important file or

25
00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.830
something, so

26
00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.970
make sure when you are in this user you
are careful about what you are doing.

27
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.270
And we have a little comic there
that really outlines the concept of

28
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.210
a superuser, So if you have a little
man there telling your dog to sit and

29
00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.430
the dog isn't sitting,
and he's saying just sit.

30
00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.660
But as soon as he says sudo sit
the dog actually sits down so,

31
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.780
that's the whole concept
of super user there.

32
00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.780
And with that,
we'll see you in the next video.
