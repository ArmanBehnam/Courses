00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:01.700
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:05.390
In this section, we'll be showing
you how to use the ADB Protocol.

3
00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.130
So, before we dive into the screen,
let's go over the commands.

4
00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:12.910
>> So, I guess the most used command or

5
00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.960
most important command is,
the ADB devices command.

6
00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.131
And, that's just to make sure that
you're actually getting connection for

7
00:00:21.131 --> 00:00:22.614
your ABD to your computer.

8
00:00:22.614 --> 00:00:27.420
And next wwe have the command ADB shell
which essentially allows you create

9
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.540
a terminal session in your Android
device through your computer's terminal.

10
00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.806
The next two are ADB root and
ADB remount and

11
00:00:35.806 --> 00:00:40.617
they kinda go hand in hand with
ADB root which essentially gives

12
00:00:40.617 --> 00:00:44.544
you administrative access
to your Android phone.

13
00:00:44.544 --> 00:00:50.031
Next, the ADB remount essentially
remounts your file system to make it,

14
00:00:50.031 --> 00:00:53.760
not only readable, but
also read and writeable.

15
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.401
So, you can actually do changes
to the Android device itself.

16
00:00:57.401 --> 00:01:01.151
>> And next we have the commands
ADB push and ADB pull.

17
00:01:01.151 --> 00:01:05.566
Now, these commands also go hand ADB push,
as it may sound or

18
00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:10.900
suggest, it's you would send a file
from your host PC to the device.

19
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.270
And ADB pull will pull a file
from your device to your host.

20
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.548
>> Kinda sounds very similar to how get
works with the push and pull commands.

21
00:01:18.548 --> 00:01:19.408
>> Coincidence?

22
00:01:19.408 --> 00:01:20.510
>> Right?
>> [LAUGH]

23
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:21.330
>> All right, and

24
00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.760
the last one is the ADB
kill server command,

25
00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.470
which essentially stops the ADB
server on your computer.

26
00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.220
And it's very useful for clearing out

27
00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.580
any devices that you had connected that
are no longer there but are appearing.

28
00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.190
Or just for refreshing.

29
00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:37.040
>> To restart the server, yeah.

30
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.990
>> It's always a good idea to refresh.

31
00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:44.960
>> And so, let's not go to the screen,
ad let's test a few of these commands out.

32
00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.450
>> Sounds good to me.

33
00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.760
>> First, you have to make
sure that your dragon board or

34
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.470
your device is connected to your PC.

35
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.530
So we're gonna go ahead and do that.

36
00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.830
>> So again,
make sure you have your OTG in and

37
00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.060
make sure you have the USB
in at the other end.

38
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:07.080
>> So currently,
we are in the same directory as our ADV.

39
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.410
So for us, since it's connected,
what we first wanna do is we wanna see

40
00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.931
if my computer is detecting the device, so

41
00:02:15.931 --> 00:02:21.520
we'll do .adv devices and
if your ADB is not or

42
00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.330
the server's not starting, then it will do
so, and as you can see here, there is this

43
00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.959
device that's being recognized, and
that's without a doubt, the dragon board.

44
00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.610
Next we can create a terminal session,
do ./addshell.

45
00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:44.590
And as you can see,
we're now inside the Android device.

46
00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.460
And we essentially created
a terminal session there.

47
00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.380
>> Can you go ahead and
list the contents of that?

48
00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.880
>> Let's go ahead and list the contents.

49
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.000
>> Wow,
that seems to be like a UNIX-based shell.

50
00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.320
So essentially anything
that you know about Unix or

51
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.220
Linux can basically transfer
over to this Android device.

52
00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.660
>> So we're gonna go ahead and
clear the file and exit out.

53
00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.513
And to exit out of the shell
you just simply do [CROSSTALK].

54
00:03:13.513 --> 00:03:19.700
And now if we want to run ADB as
a root user we simply do ./abd root.

55
00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.140
And now it's going to
restart the ADB as root.

56
00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.020
>> Can you go ahead and
go into your shell?

57
00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.520
>> Sure.

58
00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.180
>> Just as I expected,

59
00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.350
before when you were in the shell
you were prompted with dollar signs.

60
00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.800
Now, you're being prompted by hashes,
which is usually in Linux.

61
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.510
It's very indicative in Linux environments
that you're now running as a root user or

62
00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:42.320
administrator.

63
00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.999
>> Yeah, and you can also see that
one above here, it says shell, and

64
00:03:45.999 --> 00:03:47.380
below it says root.

65
00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:48.480
So, pretty straightforward.

66
00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.920
Right.

67
00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.870
We can exit out.

68
00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.145
And we can do the ADB mount as well.

69
00:03:54.145 --> 00:03:57.981
[NOISE] And, what that would just do is,

70
00:03:57.981 --> 00:04:03.109
essentially remount the Dragon
board onto the ADB.

71
00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:03.630
Right?

72
00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.138
>> Yes, and now we can actually
push files if we want to.

73
00:04:06.138 --> 00:04:07.175
Mm-hm.

74
00:04:07.175 --> 00:04:08.220
So, yeah.

75
00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.120
>> We don't have any file that
we want to push, but if we did,

76
00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.510
we essentially do /adbpush.

77
00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.175
And the destination.

78
00:04:18.175 --> 00:04:20.192
>> And the source?

79
00:04:20.192 --> 00:04:22.870
>> Yeah the source file and
then the destination.

80
00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.120
And then if we wanted to pull
it would be something similar.

81
00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.020
>> Same thing,
ADB pull source, destination.

82
00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.520
>> Then lastly we have the kill server.

83
00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.870
If we want to stop the connection
between the dragon board and

84
00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.930
the host we can just do that.

85
00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.140
>> And also it's really good for
killing resources on your computer so

86
00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:44.470
it doesn't suck them dry.

87
00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.190
>> So here we just kill the server and

88
00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:53.595
if you want to test to see whether it's
killed you can run that update db again.

89
00:04:53.595 --> 00:04:58.620
ADB devices, and you'll see,
it'll start up again.

90
00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.900
So we've just successfully
demonstrated a few commands

91
00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.750
that I think would be useful for
you when you're using ADB.

92
00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:07.780
>> Without a doubt.

93
00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:12.364
>> And so in the next section, we'll
show you how to do this, but wirelessly.

94
00:05:12.364 --> 00:05:13.525
>> Oh.

95
00:05:13.525 --> 00:05:14.170
>> We'll see you then.
