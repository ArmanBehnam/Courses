00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:04.874
In this section,
we're going to go over MS-DOS,

2
00:00:04.874 --> 00:00:07.583
which is just a bunch of
like Windows commands.

3
00:00:07.583 --> 00:00:11.050
Which you can do on the Windows
machine and Google Search.

4
00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.009
>> So like Randy said,
MS- DOS is a command prompt for Windows.

5
00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.693
And the commands on the MS-DOS
are kind of similar, but

6
00:00:16.693 --> 00:00:19.460
a little bit different
from the Unix terminal.

7
00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.900
And so, the first thing we have there,

8
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.558
just a few things I
wanna go over is d-i-r.

9
00:00:24.558 --> 00:00:28.240
And dir does the same thing that
LS does on the UNIX terminal.

10
00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.050
It basically, displays the contents
of whatever folder you're in.

11
00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.110
The next thing I wanna go over
there is you have cls and

12
00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:37.650
that's a very common one too.

13
00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.490
You might find that
very useful just clear.

14
00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:42.150
When you are running a bunch of commands
and you have a bunch of clutter on your

15
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.890
screen, you can just use that
command to clear the terminal.

16
00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:46.960
And as you can see,
you have a bunch of other commands there.

17
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.510
They're a little bit different
from the UNIX commands,

18
00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.280
but they do the same function.

19
00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.350
>> Right.
You pause video, take a look.

20
00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.032
>> Yeah, you can pause a video and-
>> Like we said,

21
00:00:56.032 --> 00:00:58.067
before later in the course,
maybe you might forget.

22
00:00:58.067 --> 00:00:59.527
And you might wanna relearn something.

23
00:00:59.527 --> 00:01:00.795
You just come back right here.

24
00:01:00.795 --> 00:01:02.150
We'll see you again.

25
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.578
>> And in the procedure documents,
we'll have even more resources for you.

26
00:01:06.578 --> 00:01:09.078
So you can look at other commands there.

27
00:01:09.078 --> 00:01:10.945
>> And with that,
this concludes the lesson.

28
00:01:10.945 --> 00:01:12.220
And we'll see you next time.
