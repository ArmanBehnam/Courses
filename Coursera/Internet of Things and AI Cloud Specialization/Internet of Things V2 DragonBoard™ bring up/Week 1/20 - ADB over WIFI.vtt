00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:02.410
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:06.730
In this section, we're going to be going
over how to configure ADB to be done

3
00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:09.160
wirelessly or via wi-fi.

4
00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:15.760
Now, the Dragonboard 410C has its OTG port
and the USB ports mutually exclusive.

5
00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.320
In other words,
if you have the OTG plugged in,

6
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.420
you can't use your USB devices.

7
00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:27.520
So let's say you're making an android
application and you try and upload

8
00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.050
it to your board, but you need to interact
with it with your mouse or keyboard.

9
00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:37.000
Turns out you can't,
because the serial device is actually

10
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.250
getting in the way of that, and that's
just the way that dragon ware is designed.

11
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.318
So it's going to be a really pain in
the butt to kind of like keep un-plugging,

12
00:00:44.318 --> 00:00:47.370
re-plugging, and especially because
if you want to interact with it

13
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.290
you won't be able to get
into the log messages.

14
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.900
>> And so to work around that we're
going to show you how to connect

15
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.220
your Dragon Board to your
local host over wi-fi.

16
00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.350
So lets dive right into the screen.

17
00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.040
>> So first things first, make sure
that you have a serial connection

18
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.700
via the USB and OTG,
just a standard USB cable.

19
00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:15.600
>> And first we are currently
in our platform tools directory,

20
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.080
which is where our ADB is located, and
so first you want to run ADB as root.

21
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.550
So we're gonna run that.

22
00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.580
And we are already running as root.

23
00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.500
Next you want to re-mount your board.

24
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.600
>> You're gonna start
overwriting some files in it so

25
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.700
you'll need to be able
to have access to that.

26
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.604
>> And next what you want to do is you
want to run this specific command so

27
00:01:40.604 --> 00:01:45.441
that you're able to open up a port for
the host to the Dragon Board.

28
00:01:45.441 --> 00:01:52.727
So it's ./adb shell and
we're gonna issue the command,

29
00:01:52.727 --> 00:01:58.412
echo service.adb.tcp.port=5555,

30
00:01:58.412 --> 00:02:03.511
and we're gonna append that to a specific

31
00:02:03.511 --> 00:02:09.193
file in your Dragon Board
located at /data and

32
00:02:09.193 --> 00:02:11.981
called local.prop.

33
00:02:11.981 --> 00:02:16.240
>> And just remember guys that if you guys
don't know already, a port is essentially

34
00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.560
a way that your device or computer is able
to communicate with the outside world, so

35
00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.634
by opening up this port we are allowing
the Dragon Board to communicate via that

36
00:02:24.634 --> 00:02:26.021
port to other computers.

37
00:02:26.021 --> 00:02:29.380
>> So we're going to go ahead and
issue the command.

38
00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.454
And after that command,
we need to call CH mod on that file,

39
00:02:34.454 --> 00:02:39.743
so we do ./adb shell chmod
0644 /data/local.prop.

40
00:02:39.743 --> 00:02:46.410
>> At this point in time you're gonna
need to restart your Dragon Board so

41
00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:53.940
that it can actually read the file and
configure the ports accordingly.

42
00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.280
>> So we're gonna go ahead and
do that via the command line.

43
00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:03.220
>> However in our case we already had
it configured to have the port open so

44
00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.530
we don't need to reboot
at this moment in time.

45
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.602
>> But
if you did want to you want to call ./adb

46
00:03:08.602 --> 00:03:10.510
reboot
>> Perfect.

47
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.590
>> So

48
00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:19.160
now what you're gonna need to do is you're
gonna need access to your Dragon Board.

49
00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.120
So what we're gonna do first is
disable this connection, and

50
00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.810
as you can see on the screen,
what we need for

51
00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.689
our host to connect to
the Dragon Board is the IP address.

52
00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.880
>> So make sure that you have
a Dragon Board connected to your internet.

53
00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.410
This will not work if you do not
have internet on your Dragon Board.

54
00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:40.720
So let's go ahead and go to our settings.

55
00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:50.170
>> So, as you can see here, we
are already connected to UCSD-protected.

56
00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.630
We're going to do a long hold and
click modify network, and

57
00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.420
that will show us the IP address.

58
00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:03.230
What we're going to do is to
check if your computer is able to

59
00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:08.200
contact the Dragon Board, you're going
to issue this command in the screen.

60
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:15.170
You're going to ping the IP address, so
for us that would be that IP address.

61
00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.960
And as you can see we are receiving and
able to communicate with it.

62
00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:23.850
We can end that command.

63
00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.890
And that's just to notify you that
you're able to make the connection.

64
00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:33.400
Now, if you want to be able to connect to
your Dragon Board via wirelessly, right?

65
00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:39.305
You would do ./ADB connect,
and enter in the IP address,

66
00:04:39.305 --> 00:04:45.510
137.130.04.120.

67
00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:53.690
And you want to add a colon with
the port number which is 5555.

68
00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:54.690
Enter.

69
00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.230
And this should show you
that it's connected.

70
00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:03.000
Now to test your device we will
run the command dot/adb devices,

71
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.235
and as you can see we
are connected to the Dragon Board.

72
00:05:06.235 --> 00:05:09.580
>> That's really cool, so
I'm not a firm believer yet.

73
00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.606
Can you go into the shell and
see if you can actually play around in it?

74
00:05:13.606 --> 00:05:14.194
>> Sure.

75
00:05:14.194 --> 00:05:15.326
./adb shell.

76
00:05:15.326 --> 00:05:16.930
>> Wow.
>> We're there.

77
00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:23.360
>> So now we're able to communicate
via WiFi to the DragonBoard.

78
00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.940
That's really cool.

79
00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.240
Now, note that the commands
that we just issued,

80
00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.450
you do not need to do every single time.

81
00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:34.345
The beginning commands with the adb root
all the way to appending that one file and

82
00:05:34.345 --> 00:05:38.428
ch modding it you only need to do
that one time and just reboot.

83
00:05:38.428 --> 00:05:41.820
Now because it's saved inside that file,
on every single subsequent reboot it

84
00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:47.100
will automatically open up port 5555 for
us or any other port that you choose.

85
00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.910
So all we need to do is just
figure out the IP address and

86
00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:53.530
just issue that adb connect and
then we're done.

87
00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:56.760
And what's even cooler is that
Android Studio will automatically

88
00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.220
see that in our device list.

89
00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:58.720
>> Yeah.

90
00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:01.300
And with that,

91
00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.910
in the next section we'll give you a brief
rundown on what we learned with adb.

92
00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:08.360
So we'll see you then.
