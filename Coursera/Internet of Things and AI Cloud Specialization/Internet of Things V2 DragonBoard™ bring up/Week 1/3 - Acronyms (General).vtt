Welcome everyone.

2
00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:04.200
In this section,

3
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.030
we're gonna go over acronyms that we'll
generally use throughout the course.

4
00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:09.560
You guys can just pause
the video whenever,

5
00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:13.080
if you wanna read what each acronym means.

6
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.690
>> And with that, we're gonna get started.

7
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.115
The first acronym we have is IoT,

8
00:00:18.115 --> 00:00:21.885
it's a very important one,
it stands for Internet of Things.

9
00:00:21.885 --> 00:00:24.080
It's basically the new
age of communication.

10
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.480
>> We're gonna be touching upon this term,
throughout the course.

11
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.410
The second thing we have is OS.

12
00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.890
OS stands for Operating System,
it's basically what runs your computer.

13
00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.910
We're gonna be touching upon
this a lot on module four.

14
00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.590
>> The next two we have, we go over
them in module three, IDE and SDK.

15
00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.940
IDE is
the Integrated Development Environment.

16
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.260
>> And
the SDK is a Software Development Kit.

17
00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.490
>> Yeah, and the next thing we
have is a Native Development Kit,

18
00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:55.010
it's a little different from
the software development kit, and

19
00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.910
we'll be going over this in module seven.

20
00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.530
>> Next we have the AVD,
which is the Android Virtual Device.

21
00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.280
We're gonna go over this in module three.

22
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.130
>> ADB is also covered in module three,
which is the Android Debug Bridge.

23
00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.630
>> Yes.

24
00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.350
The last two we have are APK and API.

25
00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.540
APK is Android Application Package.

26
00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.560
It's basically what you will
download to run your applications.

27
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.110
The next thing we have there, is API,
which is Application Programming

28
00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.910
interface, and you'll be using that
a lot in module nine, as well.

29
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.530
So you guys can pause the video here,
at any time.

30
00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.940
Make sure you guys are familiar
with all these acronyms.

31
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.030
And we'll see on the next video,
when we go over frequent terms.
