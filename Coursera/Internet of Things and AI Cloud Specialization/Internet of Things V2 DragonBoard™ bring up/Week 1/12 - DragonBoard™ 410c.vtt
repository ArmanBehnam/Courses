00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:06.560
So at this point in time, tiny bit afraid
to ask but, I guess, what is this?

2
00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.330
What is a DragonBoard 410c?

3
00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.490
>> So the DragonBoard 410c is
an amazing piece of equipment, and

4
00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.978
is basically a good development board
with a high powered SoC running on it.

5
00:00:16.978 --> 00:00:21.930
And the SoC on the Dragonboard is that
chip right there, developed by Qualcomm,

6
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.550
and basically what the SoC stands for
is it's a system on chip, and

7
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.850
you can think of it as
an integrated circuit chip that has

8
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.390
all the components of
a computer on a single chip.

9
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.600
And right off the bat,

10
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.840
the most important thing about the SoC is
that it runs an operating system on it.

11
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.900
And so in our case for
the DragonBoard 410c,

12
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.880
we have either the Android operating
system or the Ubuntu operating system.

13
00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.070
So this is an SoC.

14
00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.907
Another big branch of embedded
systems are micro controllers, and

15
00:00:51.907 --> 00:00:54.430
Randy will be explaining more about that.

16
00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.230
>> Maybe you've heard
of a micro controller?

17
00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.184
A big example would be Arduino.

18
00:01:00.184 --> 00:01:04.020
So usually you have a host computer,
you write a program in it, and

19
00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:07.780
you push it onto the Arduino and
the Arduino would run it.

20
00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.520
So basically it just controls a function
or some kind of action of a system or

21
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.130
a device that's attached to it.

22
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.060
Usually it doesn't come with an OS.

23
00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.650
So another embedded

24
00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.560
system that we'd like to talk about
is SoM, which is a system on module.

25
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.150
So these tend to have an OS on it, but you
can't really program it like an Arduino.

26
00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.270
You'd have to have a special development
kit to write your program and

27
00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.200
to push it onto the board.

28
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.120
It's basically a bare-boned SoC without
any peripherals attached to it.

29
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.766
>> Gotcha.
>> And then,

30
00:01:43.766 --> 00:01:46.970
so, we talk about embedded systems,
so what's an embedded system?

31
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.470
>> So embedded system,
it's basically an over-arching term.

32
00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.200
And the SoC, the SoM,
and micro controller,

33
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.215
they're all branches
within an embedded system.

34
00:01:56.215 --> 00:02:01.450
An embedded system is basically hardware
that has software added onto the hardware,

35
00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.960
and it can stand alone and
carry out functions.

36
00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.140
So that's basically what
an embedded system is.

37
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.120
And we'll be touching upon that
topic throughout our course,

38
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.080
so make sure you really understand
the concept of an embedded system here.

39
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.770
And we'll have more resources and we'll
explain more about what embedded systems

40
00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.810
are in our documentation so
you can take a look at that.

41
00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.110
And with that,
we'll see you in our next video.
