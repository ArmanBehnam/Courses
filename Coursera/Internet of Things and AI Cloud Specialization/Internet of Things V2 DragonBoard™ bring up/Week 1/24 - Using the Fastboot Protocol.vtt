Hello everyone, and
welcome to this section.

2
00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:07.390
Here we will be giving you a few Fastboot
commands that we think will be useful for

3
00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.590
you when playing around
with your Dragon Board.

4
00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.258
Now, do note that Fastboot
is very powerful and

5
00:00:15.258 --> 00:00:19.100
easy to use so we are only giving
you a few of the commands.

6
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.260
>> So without a doubt the most
common thing I think everyone

7
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.770
should use is Fastboot devices,
which essentially lists

8
00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.060
all the devices that are connected to
Fastboot at this moment in time and

9
00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.600
it's really useful to know
if you are connected or not.

10
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.890
>> And the next command is called flash or
.fastboot/flash and

11
00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.930
you're going to pair that with the
destination and source, and what this will

12
00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:46.470
do is it'll flash essentially file systems
and images onto your board that will

13
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:52.130
allow you to perhaps change the operating
system or boot some kind of stuff into it.

14
00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.470
>> And Fastboot is already very smart to
know like if you say Fastboot flash boot,

15
00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.230
and it provides a boot image itself
that'll know exactly where to put that

16
00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.120
boot image,
where specifically on the flash itself.

17
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.650
>> In the next module,

18
00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.570
you'll see that we go over how to
use Fastboot at least as one of our

19
00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.200
potential ways to play around with
the operating system of the Dragon Board.

20
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.250
>> And just like Jacob said before,
Fastboot is a very powerful tool, and

21
00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.700
with great power comes
great responsibility.

22
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.350
So make sure you know what you're doing.

23
00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.154
Don't haphazardly start using Fastboot and
start flashing random files into it.

24
00:01:28.154 --> 00:01:32.528
Make sure you follow step by step and
you know what you're doing.
