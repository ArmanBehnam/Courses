00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.870
Greetings, everyone.

2
00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:05.590
Here, in this section,
we're gonna go over levels of abstraction.

3
00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:07.940
So what's a level of abstraction?

4
00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:11.730
>> So levels of abstraction is
a very important concept, and

5
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.520
it's basically everything that happens
from the circuit logic level on

6
00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.470
the hardware to all the way to
the software in high-level programming.

7
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.224
So let's just do a quick run-through of
everything that is part of the levels

8
00:00:23.224 --> 00:00:24.090
of abstraction,

9
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.982
and we'll touch open everything we've
talked before in the previous videos.

10
00:00:27.982 --> 00:00:32.162
So, at the very top, we see Perl,
Python, Shell, Java.

11
00:00:32.162 --> 00:00:33.980
Those are examples of
high-level programming.

12
00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.580
That means it's easy to use,
very high-level, but at the same time,

13
00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.560
you can't really get into the machine
code, the nitty-gritty stuff.

14
00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.640
And then next, we have C and C++,
those are considered middle and high-level

15
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.602
programming, and those give you a little
bit more control over the hardware.

16
00:00:49.602 --> 00:00:52.182
And the next thing we have
is assembly language.

17
00:00:52.182 --> 00:00:56.022
In assembly language, the whole field
changes, so that's the big thing there.

18
00:00:56.022 --> 00:00:56.570
>> Right.

19
00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.220
>> You no longer see brackets,
you no longer see straight words or

20
00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.650
anything, you just see commands,
commands and registers.

21
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.580
That's all machine language.

22
00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.850
Next thing we have there is machine code.

23
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.190
Machine code will be stuff like
hexadecimal or different type of

24
00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.790
representations, and it'll be
closer to the logic circuit there.

25
00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.190
And then at the very low level there,
we have binary code.

26
00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.450
That's the lowest level you can get there,
and that's basically-

27
00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:23.560
>> Just a bunch of ones and zeroes.

28
00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.110
>> Just a bunch of ones and zeroes.

29
00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.625
And that's exactly what'll
be going in to the hardware.

30
00:01:27.625 --> 00:01:29.730
>> Right,
that's what your computer will read and

31
00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:30.350
process-
>> Yeah.

32
00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:31.570
>> To execute your instructions.

33
00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.690
>> On the hardware, you'll have a bunch of
circuits and transistors, and the ones and

34
00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:40.150
the zeroes will be decoded by the circuit,
and it'll perform tasks for you.

35
00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.570
>> Yeah, whatever you told it to do.

36
00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.150
With that, that concludes this lesson,
and we'll see you guys next time.
