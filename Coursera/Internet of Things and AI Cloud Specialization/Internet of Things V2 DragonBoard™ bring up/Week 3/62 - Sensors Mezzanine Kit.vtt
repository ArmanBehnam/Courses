00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200
Hello, everyone. In this video,

2
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:08.350
we'll be going over the Mezzanine kit that we've chosen for this course to you primarily.

3
00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:13.164
It is the Sensors Mezzanine for 96Boards.

4
00:00:13.164 --> 00:00:17.660
So, we get a brief overview of what we're going to be doing over.

5
00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.420
We will be talking about the Mezzanine.

6
00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.660
We will be describing it by looking

7
00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.670
at it hands-on and we'll be looking at the different ports,

8
00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.105
and then we will be going through each individual sensor,

9
00:00:32.105 --> 00:00:35.820
and then we will talk about the sensor itself, what it does,

10
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.602
and then what you can possibly use it for.

11
00:00:40.602 --> 00:00:45.870
We will be showing how the Mezzanine looks in person.

12
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:52.885
So, yes. This is the mezzanine that we're using over here.

13
00:00:52.885 --> 00:00:55.935
As you can see here, we will be learning more about this later on.

14
00:00:55.935 --> 00:00:57.495
So here, the ports,

15
00:00:57.495 --> 00:00:59.800
these are actually called growth connectors.

16
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.090
They each come with a little connector like this.

17
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.315
You can just plug them in really easily,

18
00:01:04.315 --> 00:01:06.350
like this, and there you go.

19
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.857
Take it out.

20
00:01:09.857 --> 00:01:12.670
So this is a lot easier than

21
00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.425
a normal wiring with a breadboard just because you get the right wire,

22
00:01:17.425 --> 00:01:20.315
cut it to length, and put it in.

23
00:01:20.315 --> 00:01:21.870
There's a bunch of ports here.

24
00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.635
These are actual Arduino headers.

25
00:01:24.635 --> 00:01:27.660
This is actually the same alignment as

26
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.350
Arduino UNO so any shield that you can use with the Arduino UNO,

27
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.680
you can use with this.

28
00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.980
There's a connectors directly connected to the baseboard of the DragonBoard,

29
00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:45.160
here and there, and there's also these connectors on the side.

30
00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.160
These are the digital ones that connect to Arduino,

31
00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.760
and these are some of the analog ones here.

32
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.845
As you can see,

33
00:01:53.845 --> 00:02:00.935
this is how it looks on the website where you might buy it.

34
00:02:00.935 --> 00:02:07.120
It shows you each individual sensor and all the connectors what it comes with.

35
00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.130
As Simon mentioned on the side,

36
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.215
it has all these cool connectors,

37
00:02:12.215 --> 00:02:18.790
it has Arduino capabilities which we'll discuss later,

38
00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.280
and then it comes with a lot of sample projects

39
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.690
that you can install and then run yourselves.

40
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.560
As Andrew mentioned earlier,

41
00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.665
there is actually 18 mega-chip

42
00:02:33.665 --> 00:02:36.915
which is essentially what Arduino program we're running on.

43
00:02:36.915 --> 00:02:38.218
It's right on the board,

44
00:02:38.218 --> 00:02:43.640
that's what's connected on all the headers and our coding is you can just upload,

45
00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:49.010
you can put the board on to the DragonBoard and then upload to the Arduino to the UART,

46
00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.655
you don't have to use your computer or anything,

47
00:02:51.655 --> 00:02:53.622
just upload into the Arduino,

48
00:02:53.622 --> 00:02:55.290
just do it natively on the DragonBoard.

49
00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.730
What's cool at this kit

50
00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.958
is that it comes with everything you need to get started with sensors.

51
00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:06.375
There's a buzzer one potentiometer.

52
00:03:06.375 --> 00:03:08.875
We will be going over these more,

53
00:03:08.875 --> 00:03:12.825
but it's just a quick reason why we like it.

54
00:03:12.825 --> 00:03:15.775
There's also a quick start guide for getting set up,

55
00:03:15.775 --> 00:03:17.285
where you need to install,

56
00:03:17.285 --> 00:03:24.165
and even some example projects on their GitHub of cool things you can do.

57
00:03:24.165 --> 00:03:28.126
And so, we can talk more about the Mezzanine.

58
00:03:28.126 --> 00:03:32.240
As we said earlier there's much of ports,

59
00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.359
there's five baseboard GPIO ports,

60
00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:37.805
those connected directly to the DragonBoard,

61
00:03:37.805 --> 00:03:42.145
and there's four on the middle right side of it,

62
00:03:42.145 --> 00:03:43.370
right next to Arduino header,

63
00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.155
and there's one diode AB,

64
00:03:46.155 --> 00:03:47.885
next to the analog headers.

65
00:03:47.885 --> 00:03:52.715
And those connect directly to the GPIO of the DragonBoard.

66
00:03:52.715 --> 00:03:55.600
There are also five I2C ports.

67
00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:03.405
You can find those on the middle left and also the bottom left side of the board.

68
00:04:03.405 --> 00:04:07.430
And there's five more digital ports specifically coming from the Arduino.

69
00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.950
Again, those are the far right,

70
00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.082
and three analog ports of the top,

71
00:04:12.082 --> 00:04:15.460
the three on the top left.

72
00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:18.135
There is also two six-pin SPI headers,

73
00:04:18.135 --> 00:04:21.550
and those are the little blue blocks that you can see there.

74
00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:24.265
In addition to those growth connectors,

75
00:04:24.265 --> 00:04:27.150
there's also ports that you are not yet familiar with,

76
00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.190
such as a microUSB interface.

77
00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:30.640
This connects directly to the UART,

78
00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.065
so you can connect your microUSB right in there,

79
00:04:34.065 --> 00:04:36.130
and then connect another end to your computer.

80
00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:37.905
This is really useful for, let's say,

81
00:04:37.905 --> 00:04:41.070
accessing the board through a CL console.

82
00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.120
We will be talking about that more later.

83
00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.340
As we've said earlier,

84
00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:46.710
the header is compatible with

85
00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.190
an Arduino UNO shield with the little blue headers right there.

86
00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.405
Yes. So, if you're a little confused right now,

87
00:04:54.405 --> 00:04:57.475
don't worry, it will clear all this up later.

88
00:04:57.475 --> 00:05:00.750
This is just introducing all the ports on the Mezzanine.

89
00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:01.064
Totally.

90
00:05:01.064 --> 00:05:06.315
The first sensor is the LCD RGB Backlight,

91
00:05:06.315 --> 00:05:11.760
and this allows us to put whatever text we want on the LCD,

92
00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.750
so we can put like, "Hello!"

93
00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:17.385
and it all show up on the LCD.

94
00:05:17.385 --> 00:05:19.728
And then on the background,

95
00:05:19.728 --> 00:05:21.745
you can make it whatever color you want.

96
00:05:21.745 --> 00:05:29.325
This could be a very useful and sending you a reminder,

97
00:05:29.325 --> 00:05:32.805
or sending you what time it is maybe,

98
00:05:32.805 --> 00:05:36.135
like a mini clock.

99
00:05:36.135 --> 00:05:37.335
Yes.

100
00:05:37.335 --> 00:05:40.625
The next component is the Smart Relay.

101
00:05:40.625 --> 00:05:44.855
Essentially, this is just allowing you to control a larger,

102
00:05:44.855 --> 00:05:50.415
very possibly dangerous circuit with your smaller DragonBoard circuit.

103
00:05:50.415 --> 00:05:52.460
You would plug in, let's say,

104
00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:58.505
the ground and power to a fridge into the relay on one end,

105
00:05:58.505 --> 00:06:02.730
and then plug in your DragonBoard connector right there.

106
00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:05.340
So, if you tell the relay to be on,

107
00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:08.895
then you can make the circuit connected for the fridge and that'll be on.

108
00:06:08.895 --> 00:06:10.495
That's it. If you're ever want to control

109
00:06:10.495 --> 00:06:14.210
a large electronic devices with your small DragonBoard, this is the way you would do it.

110
00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:18.630
The next sensor is the Buzzer,

111
00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:21.885
and this creates a buzzing sound.

112
00:06:21.885 --> 00:06:26.920
It's very loud where you can't control the sound as well.

113
00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:32.915
This might be used for sending you a notification,

114
00:06:32.915 --> 00:06:35.322
where you might need to go somewhere out,

115
00:06:35.322 --> 00:06:37.175
like a specific time,

116
00:06:37.175 --> 00:06:40.170
or help wake you up maybe.

117
00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:41.440
Oh, boy.

118
00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:46.365
Yes. It will definitely wake you up because of the sound that it makes and yes.

119
00:06:46.365 --> 00:06:49.220
It's horrifying. So, the next one up,

120
00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:52.510
this kind of the opposite of the buzzer.

121
00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:53.975
It takes in sound.

122
00:06:53.975 --> 00:06:59.275
This gives you a relative value of how loud the sound is.

123
00:06:59.275 --> 00:07:01.405
It won't tell you actual decibels,

124
00:07:01.405 --> 00:07:04.321
but this is useful to see if there is a loudest

125
00:07:04.321 --> 00:07:07.100
back and noise at some point or a window breaking possibly,

126
00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:11.005
if you want to add this to a security system.

127
00:07:11.005 --> 00:07:13.990
This is the Touch Sensor.

128
00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:18.290
Basically, what it does is it detects whether you've touched it or not,

129
00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:21.355
and you can use this as a pseudo-button.

130
00:07:21.355 --> 00:07:24.335
We found with the actual button,

131
00:07:24.335 --> 00:07:27.220
there were some issues with it in

132
00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:30.665
terms of what programs you can run with it and what you can't run,

133
00:07:30.665 --> 00:07:33.030
but the touch sensor will always run,

134
00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:37.140
and it basically to text whether you're touching it.

135
00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:38.663
So if you're touching it,

136
00:07:38.663 --> 00:07:41.155
there will be high voltage,

137
00:07:41.155 --> 00:07:42.360
and then when you're not touching it,

138
00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:43.675
it will be low voltage.

139
00:07:43.675 --> 00:07:48.520
And this tells the program that you can touch it,

140
00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:53.040
and then not touch it in a certain amount of time,

141
00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:56.195
and then turn off something or on something.

142
00:07:56.195 --> 00:08:02.780
And this could be used to turn on lights if you're touching it or not, like a switch.

143
00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:05.363
Yes.

144
00:08:05.363 --> 00:08:08.350
So the next one is a Rotary Angle Sensor.

145
00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:10.430
So essentially, that little knob,

146
00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:12.500
if you turn it a bit,

147
00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:14.510
it changes the value that outputs, and from that,

148
00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:19.690
you can try to figure out what angle it's turned to.

149
00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:21.725
For those of you that are familiar circuits,

150
00:08:21.725 --> 00:08:24.050
this is also known as a potentiometer.

151
00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:25.295
But if you're not familiar with that,

152
00:08:25.295 --> 00:08:29.030
don't worry about it, just think of it as it tells you the angle.

153
00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:33.007
So some uses for this is a button or a sensor,

154
00:08:33.007 --> 00:08:36.080
you only have like one input whether it's on or off, for this,

155
00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:40.683
you can give it some varying values from 0 to 180 to see like,

156
00:08:40.683 --> 00:08:44.990
"Oh, I want to add like 10 hours instead of 12 hours."

157
00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:47.240
It won't just go from 0 or 12 hours.

158
00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:49.040
You can have some midway.

159
00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:53.710
So, the next one is Temperature and Humidity Sensor.

160
00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:55.860
This is pretty self-explanatory.

161
00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:58.315
It gives you two values, temperature,

162
00:08:58.315 --> 00:09:04.025
and humidity, and this might be used for just tracking the weather.

163
00:09:04.025 --> 00:09:09.700
And then just maybe you want to do some data analysis on the weather,

164
00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:12.058
just your personal methods,

165
00:09:12.058 --> 00:09:15.955
you can just track your temperature and humidity,

166
00:09:15.955 --> 00:09:19.670
and do your cool stuff with it.

167
00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:21.430
The next one is, again,

168
00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:24.340
if you fill the circuits, I'm sure you know what this is.

169
00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:26.450
It's just a simple LED.

170
00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:30.725
There is a little-added benefit is that the little screw on it.

171
00:09:30.725 --> 00:09:33.245
You can adjust the sensitivity of it,

172
00:09:33.245 --> 00:09:36.295
so the higher the knob turned,

173
00:09:36.295 --> 00:09:39.460
then the harder it is to turn LED because it's more resistance,

174
00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:41.901
and the last one it's more sensitive,

175
00:09:41.901 --> 00:09:43.390
so it gets better with less voltage.

176
00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:47.019
For those of you who might not be familiar with LEDs,

177
00:09:47.019 --> 00:09:48.210
it's just the light.

178
00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:48.584
Yes.

179
00:09:48.584 --> 00:09:52.570
You do tilt it to head on and hola, there's lights.

180
00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:54.790
So yes, you might want to use this to just

181
00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:57.295
give you some feedback whether or not you're program is running right,

182
00:09:57.295 --> 00:09:59.185
or you want to light something up,

183
00:09:59.185 --> 00:10:00.670
maybe not, it's kind of weak,

184
00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:01.900
but if you wanted to.

185
00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:05.390
The next one is a Light Sensor,

186
00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:08.055
and it's the opposite of the LED.

187
00:10:08.055 --> 00:10:10.066
It detects whether there's a light or not,

188
00:10:10.066 --> 00:10:13.790
and this could be useful to track motion, let's say.

189
00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:17.570
If you just hover your hand over it where there's light,

190
00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:22.170
and then the light sensor will detect less light than it did before.

191
00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:25.940
And then once you move your hand away from it, there will be more light.

192
00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:31.295
This could be used for detecting whether something went over to light sensor,

193
00:10:31.295 --> 00:10:34.290
like it turns up the view from the light sensor,

194
00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:37.150
and yes, this could be used for

195
00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:42.145
just surveillance purposes whatever you want to do with it.

196
00:10:42.145 --> 00:10:45.020
The last one is a very simple Button.

197
00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:50.240
So this works similar to the touch sensor, but yes,

198
00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:52.915
it just connects, you touch it, and it connects to circuit,

199
00:10:52.915 --> 00:10:57.170
and basically just tells you one or zero, whether it's on or off.

200
00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:59.110
It's on when you press it,

201
00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:02.030
and it's off when it's not pressed. So, yes.

202
00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:08.835
And then there's the Mini Servo and this basically allows something to rotate,

203
00:11:08.835 --> 00:11:14.650
and you can program how much it rotates.

204
00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:16.540
And this could be useful for,

205
00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:22.160
you can create something like a helicopter maybe.

206
00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:27.885
You just want to see how a helicopter might look through the circuit itself,

207
00:11:27.885 --> 00:11:30.872
and you can just put a little propeller,

208
00:11:30.872 --> 00:11:34.490
and then it'll just twirl around.

209
00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:36.860
Maybe not with this servo because it didn't spin that fast,

210
00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:39.905
but you can make it look like a helicopter.

211
00:11:39.905 --> 00:11:42.230
Yes, but that's basically the idea.

212
00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:43.670
You can you can turn things.

213
00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:45.750
Yes.

214
00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:54.895
There are more resources in the reading section about the Sensors Mezzanine,

215
00:11:54.895 --> 00:11:57.371
and about how to get to the GitHub,

216
00:11:57.371 --> 00:11:59.770
so look out for that in the sources.

217
00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:08.705
So take away, it allows for easy access to the sensors and the actuators.

218
00:12:08.705 --> 00:12:15.870
The actuators are the things that react like a Mini Servo,

219
00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:17.755
the LED, these are the actuators and sensors.

220
00:12:17.755 --> 00:12:19.230
They're pretty self-explanatory.

221
00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:21.390
They just sense whatever you want it sense.

222
00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:23.450
Yes, taking data from the world.

223
00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:28.710
There are a variety modules in this kit,

224
00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:33.013
and this basically allows you to do anything you want.

225
00:12:33.013 --> 00:12:37.500
There's so much, but there is a limit because it's not all this instant you possibly get,

226
00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:42.600
but it's a pretty good variety to get started with your projects.
