00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:05.905
Hello. In this video we'll be going over Updates, Upgrades and Dependencies.

2
00:00:05.905 --> 00:00:07.654
That might sound a little weird at first,

3
00:00:07.654 --> 00:00:10.670
but we will understand it more as we go through the video.

4
00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:16.810
So, we will be starting off with our Package Manager,

5
00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:18.695
and define what it is.

6
00:00:18.695 --> 00:00:23.700
And we will be showing you one Package Manager as an example, which is APT.

7
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.700
And show of what each individual command does,

8
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.791
the important commands, not all the commands.

9
00:00:29.791 --> 00:00:35.740
This is an important distinction as this is not a Package Manager tutorial.

10
00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.935
It's just how you get started with it.

11
00:00:38.935 --> 00:00:40.780
And we'll be talking about

12
00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:47.445
all the important Dependencies that you might need for your other programs.

13
00:00:47.445 --> 00:00:50.095
As mentioned earlier, this isn't

14
00:00:50.095 --> 00:00:53.535
all the Dependencies that you might need for your project.

15
00:00:53.535 --> 00:00:56.734
This is just the ones that we are using a lot.

16
00:00:56.734 --> 00:00:58.458
Yes.

17
00:00:58.458 --> 00:01:02.325
So, I'll be giving it off to Simon.

18
00:01:02.325 --> 00:01:05.125
So, what is a package manager you might ask?

19
00:01:05.125 --> 00:01:10.020
Well, it basically, if you ever installed a program on your computer,

20
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.730
you maybe possibly have used an installer that you had to download.

21
00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:15.250
So, this kind of gets rid of that,

22
00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.585
and puts that program in a small Package.

23
00:01:18.585 --> 00:01:21.495
And it's given to a Package manager.

24
00:01:21.495 --> 00:01:23.295
So, that is easily installed.

25
00:01:23.295 --> 00:01:28.210
So, not only does it install just the program itself,

26
00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:33.730
if it has any Dependencies that aren't installed yet, it will install it with it.

27
00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:40.175
And then, one often used manager in Debian is APT, which,

28
00:01:40.175 --> 00:01:42.330
stands for Advanced Package Tool,

29
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.570
and it basically it is like the gateway to all the programs you

30
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.955
want to use on a Debian Linux system.

31
00:01:49.955 --> 00:01:53.160
So, I'll be talking about some of the commands that

32
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.765
you'll be running countless times through your experience with Debian.

33
00:01:57.765 --> 00:02:01.550
Joe trust me you'll be using this a lot.

34
00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.125
So, the first command is sudo apt-get update,

35
00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:08.115
and this is not actually updating the system.

36
00:02:08.115 --> 00:02:11.975
What it's doing is like it's just updating information.

37
00:02:11.975 --> 00:02:14.965
Like let us say I want to give you some news.

38
00:02:14.965 --> 00:02:17.290
I'm like updating you on the news itself,

39
00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.705
but you're not like actually doing anything with it.

40
00:02:20.705 --> 00:02:22.860
So, is it just fetches a list of

41
00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:30.825
Packages and the links that are provided in this document.

42
00:02:30.825 --> 00:02:35.620
And where the update actually happens is the sudo apt-get upgrade.

43
00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.820
And this basically installs all the links that you got from update,

44
00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:46.650
and then install the Packages that you specified and those links.

45
00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.080
Sudo apt-get dist-upgrade.

46
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.355
It's the same as upgrade,

47
00:02:50.355 --> 00:02:52.785
except that it will do a little bit more.

48
00:02:52.785 --> 00:02:58.602
Intelligently install Dependencies and remove unnecessary Packages,

49
00:02:58.602 --> 00:03:02.295
that aren't needed anymore because of the upgrade.

50
00:03:02.295 --> 00:03:04.480
While it is intelligent,

51
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.100
this might still be a little dangerous sometimes as

52
00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.825
you don't want to remove some Packages,

53
00:03:09.825 --> 00:03:11.340
or like install more Packages,

54
00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.110
because of the fact that it might take up more memory.

55
00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.090
And then the last thing is sudo apt-get install,

56
00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.015
and this is just installing a specific Package that you want.

57
00:03:24.015 --> 00:03:27.020
So, as we saw in the earlier video,

58
00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.600
we wanted to install just Eclipse.

59
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.065
So, we typed in sudo apt-get install Eclipse,

60
00:03:33.065 --> 00:03:37.435
and then this installed the newest version of that Package.

61
00:03:37.435 --> 00:03:39.895
Yes.

62
00:03:39.895 --> 00:03:44.810
So, yes. So, some important Dependencies,

63
00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.290
again these are not all of them, it is just that the majority that

64
00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.865
we'll be using in this course.

65
00:03:50.865 --> 00:03:53.225
So, you can see here, this is just a quick command.

66
00:03:53.225 --> 00:03:54.955
If you copy and paste it into your journal,

67
00:03:54.955 --> 00:03:56.862
you can just install all of these at once.

68
00:03:56.862 --> 00:04:03.370
It will take some time, but this just helps us avoid just typing them each individually.

69
00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.610
So, you could if you wanted to type in sudo apt-get install arduino-mk.

70
00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.015
And then sudo apt-get install arduino,

71
00:04:10.015 --> 00:04:14.275
and then just do each one, git build-essential autoconf.

72
00:04:14.275 --> 00:04:17.020
To help you with that, we just put them all under one thing.

73
00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:22.605
So, we'll be highlighting some important Dependencies that we are using.

74
00:04:22.605 --> 00:04:25.385
The first one is the arduino-mk,

75
00:04:25.385 --> 00:04:30.700
Dependency which basically is just a Makefile for Arduino files.

76
00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:38.013
This is useful when we want to upload an Arduino program through the command line.

77
00:04:38.013 --> 00:04:41.030
And, we'll be showing you this in-depth later on.

78
00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.230
This is the Arduino IDE.

79
00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:45.750
So, again we had an Eclipse IDE,

80
00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.865
and this is essentially the same thing.

81
00:04:48.865 --> 00:04:51.165
The only thing about Arduino is that very helpful,

82
00:04:51.165 --> 00:04:55.330
which is there's some extra tools that's there specifically for Arduino.

83
00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:00.408
And then get will also be talking about this one more in a later video,

84
00:05:00.408 --> 00:05:03.040
but basically you need to have

85
00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:07.490
basic version control capabilities like saving to a pository.

86
00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.530
That might sound a little weird, will you'll understand it more on later videos.

87
00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:13.735
And Build-Essential.

88
00:05:13.735 --> 00:05:17.335
This is mostly just like important programs that we need to,

89
00:05:17.335 --> 00:05:19.780
if we wanted to build programs from source.

90
00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.410
And Python-Dev.

91
00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.660
So, this is the language that we'll be

92
00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:28.835
using for the majority in this course which is Python.

93
00:05:28.835 --> 00:05:30.565
We chose it because it's easy to use,

94
00:05:30.565 --> 00:05:34.620
and a lot of modules and tools to use.

95
00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:39.900
So, take away. So, sudo apt-get will be

96
00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:45.560
your main access point to installing new things on Linux.

97
00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:52.110
This will help you install new Packages,

98
00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:53.820
because of how easy it is.

99
00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:58.070
You'll just type in one command and it will just install it for you.

100
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:01.735
Yes. Remember Package Managers aren't the only way of installing Packages.

101
00:06:01.735 --> 00:06:04.250
The reason why I installed build-essentials before is,

102
00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.865
sometimes we also want to build program from source.

103
00:06:06.865 --> 00:06:10.130
And honestly you would basically just

104
00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:14.345
download the file folder like files that they give you,

105
00:06:14.345 --> 00:06:16.760
and then just build it from there.

106
00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.450
Not going to the Package manager at all.

107
00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:23.270
So many programs will require different Dependencies,

108
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:28.695
and we want you to explore whatever Dependencies you might need for your program.

109
00:06:28.695 --> 00:06:33.095
And yes, we just provided a few as we mentioned earlier.

110
00:06:33.095 --> 00:06:38.980
But if you want to know more about what Packages are necessary for your program,

111
00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:42.550
we want you to use your favorite search engine to find

112
00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:48.455
on your search engine to match what you need.

113
00:06:48.455 --> 00:06:52.065
In conclusion, we just wanted you

114
00:06:52.065 --> 00:06:58.665
to learn about just installing new things due to the terminal.

115
00:06:58.665 --> 00:07:03.675
Usually you would just go on your web and search for your Package,

116
00:07:03.675 --> 00:07:05.310
and just press download.

117
00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:07.915
And how it will help you install programs,

118
00:07:07.915 --> 00:07:10.815
like on Mac or Windows.

119
00:07:10.815 --> 00:07:14.460
But, and the next you can just do everything through the terminal.

120
00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:17.000
Very quick. Yes, very easy.
