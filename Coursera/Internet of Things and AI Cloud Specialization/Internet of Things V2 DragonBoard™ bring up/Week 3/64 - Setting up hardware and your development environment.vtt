00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:08.430
Welcome to our video for setting up your hardware and development environment.

2
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.010
This is mostly stuff like your Mezzanine and

3
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.395
your sensors so you can work on what you need to do.

4
00:00:16.395 --> 00:00:21.840
Here's a brief overview of everything we'll be doing in this video.

5
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.760
The first thing we're going to do is talking about

6
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.555
the Mezzanine Attachment procedure

7
00:00:25.555 --> 00:00:30.065
and some precautions about what to do and what not to do.

8
00:00:30.065 --> 00:00:34.500
Then it's showing us a demo of us actually attaching it.

9
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.590
Next, we're going to do a walkthrough of the layout of the Mezzanine.

10
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.745
Basically, where everything is and what are the functions of everything.

11
00:00:43.745 --> 00:00:47.698
The last part is finally connecting a module to the Sensors Mezzanine.

12
00:00:47.698 --> 00:00:50.175
In this case, the LED module.

13
00:00:50.175 --> 00:00:54.435
Before we install the Mezzanine we want to advise

14
00:00:54.435 --> 00:00:57.990
you to follow some of these precautions.

15
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.905
The first one is to never install your Mezzanine while the DragonBoard is on.

16
00:01:01.905 --> 00:01:07.925
This is important because you might short circuit or if you guys don't know,

17
00:01:07.925 --> 00:01:17.055
that will cause there to be infinite current through the wires, so you don't want that.

18
00:01:17.055 --> 00:01:24.470
The second part is to work in a ESD compliant environment.

19
00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.470
We can't really do that right now but, if you guys can,

20
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.180
we really advise you to work in it to avoid damaging your parts.

21
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.555
We haven't really found anything wrong with not using it,

22
00:01:37.555 --> 00:01:40.140
but you guys should.

23
00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.809
Protect your investment.

24
00:01:43.809 --> 00:01:47.130
The next part is how to attach it.

25
00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.880
The first thing you're going to do is attaching the spacers to the Mezzanine.

26
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.235
The Mezzanine comes with four white spacers and screws to attach them.

27
00:01:55.235 --> 00:01:58.265
You just want to put them on the corresponding holes.

28
00:01:58.265 --> 00:02:01.005
We'll be showing this after this but,

29
00:02:01.005 --> 00:02:03.705
after you put the spacers on,

30
00:02:03.705 --> 00:02:04.989
you want to make sure your DragonBoard is not powered

31
00:02:04.989 --> 00:02:08.360
so you don't damage it when you try to put it on.

32
00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.175
And then when you actually want to put the Mezzanine on,

33
00:02:11.175 --> 00:02:12.630
you will align the pins with

34
00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.590
the low speed header then insert the Mezzanine to the DragonBoard.

35
00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.090
Once you double check that all the pins are

36
00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.020
in the header and everything's correctly aligned,

37
00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.450
then you can power on your DragonBoard and it should work fine.

38
00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.015
Now, we'll be showing you,

39
00:02:26.015 --> 00:02:30.485
us actually putting the Mezzanine together.

40
00:02:30.485 --> 00:02:34.410
Now, we'll be attaching the Mezzanine to the DragonBoard.

41
00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.776
Here is the Mezzanine itself,

42
00:02:37.776 --> 00:02:40.080
and here's the screw.

43
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.980
You don't see? Here's the little screw and the little spacer.

44
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.770
We'll be putting this on the Mezzanine.

45
00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.050
Three of them are already on, so we don't need to worry about that.

46
00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.715
I'll bring it closer.

47
00:02:54.715 --> 00:02:58.643
And then, as you can see here,

48
00:02:58.643 --> 00:03:07.765
just put the screw into the hole and then put the little spacer washer into it.

49
00:03:07.765 --> 00:03:10.510
There we go, like that.

50
00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:18.124
And then just twist on.

51
00:03:18.124 --> 00:03:19.500
And now it's good. You have

52
00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.605
all four spacers on and you can attached it to the DragonBoard.

53
00:03:23.605 --> 00:03:26.650
I'll grab the DragonBoard right here and, as you can see here,

54
00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:32.790
there's all the low speed header pins correspond directly to these pins right here.

55
00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:40.715
And then you just want to align it like that and double check that everything is good.

56
00:03:40.715 --> 00:03:43.212
And then just press in.

57
00:03:43.212 --> 00:03:47.080
It takes a little bit of force but it shouldn't take that much.

58
00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.880
Just double check that all the pins are aligned, as you can see here.

59
00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.570
And then now that that's good, you can power it on,

60
00:03:54.570 --> 00:04:00.650
and we'll just put it on the table and plug in the power.

61
00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.710
Now everything's fine.

62
00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:09.125
A small little light is blinking to show that it's on.

63
00:04:09.125 --> 00:04:13.010
And there's no smoke or fire or anything.

64
00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.995
It should be good.

65
00:04:16.995 --> 00:04:22.735
After this we just go back to the sides and talk about the Mezzanine some more.

66
00:04:22.735 --> 00:04:26.555
So, we want to go through what is actually on the Mezzanine.

67
00:04:26.555 --> 00:04:31.570
The first part is the low speed header and we went over this earlier,

68
00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.145
it's the black thing on the top in the image,

69
00:04:35.145 --> 00:04:41.670
and this is where the Mezzanine can connect to the DragonBoard.

70
00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:43.900
And the next part is that GPIO pins.

71
00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.250
GPIO pins are located on

72
00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:56.810
the right most row on the bottom and also on the left most side.

73
00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:03.000
It's the white part on the left most side. It's labeled "AB" and these

74
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.015
are all your GPIO pins.

75
00:05:05.015 --> 00:05:12.625
I2C, I2C1 and 3.3 volts are located in your middle column.

76
00:05:12.625 --> 00:05:20.280
And then the SPI is the blue part on

77
00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:28.560
the left most column with the six metal pins coming out of it.

78
00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:36.860
And then the UART is the micro USB at the top,

79
00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:45.515
where you can connect micro USB to USB connect wire to whatever you're using.

80
00:05:45.515 --> 00:05:50.635
So all those connectors are directly mapped to the DragonBoard.

81
00:05:50.635 --> 00:05:53.168
They just provide a quick easy access to them.

82
00:05:53.168 --> 00:05:57.000
So now we'll talk about all the connectors and ports that are

83
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.635
corresponding to the ATmega on the Mezzanine itself.

84
00:06:01.635 --> 00:06:06.630
First off, you can see the ATmega chip itself right in the middle.

85
00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:12.170
The big square, right above the blue header, highlighted in blue.

86
00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:16.040
The first thing we want to go through is the Arduino Headers,

87
00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:21.930
those are the two long thin blue headers and those are supposed to

88
00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:24.540
look exactly like the headers in our Arduino Uno so

89
00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:27.940
that any Arduino shield that we want connect will fit perfectly on.

90
00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:32.730
The next part is grove connectors to some of those pins,

91
00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:35.760
and those would be the digital I/0 three to seven.

92
00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.405
And you can see on the right side,

93
00:06:38.405 --> 00:06:40.930
it's all those grove connectors there.

94
00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:44.845
And then we have three analog inputs A0 to

95
00:06:44.845 --> 00:06:50.100
A2 and that's going to be on the left side, the three on the top left.

96
00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:54.040
Again, those are mapped directly to the blue header pins.

97
00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:56.640
They're just an easy connection that you can use.

98
00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:58.720
The fourth one is the I2C, the Arduino I2C,

99
00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:03.865
and that is labeled "AI2C" for Arduino.

100
00:07:03.865 --> 00:07:06.915
That will be located on the bottom left as highlighted on blue.

101
00:07:06.915 --> 00:07:10.884
And then we have the SPI header for the Arduino.

102
00:07:10.884 --> 00:07:14.880
That is located on the very bottom.

103
00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:18.495
It is also a blue header and sets six pins.

104
00:07:18.495 --> 00:07:23.945
The last two are the reset button and the power button,

105
00:07:23.945 --> 00:07:26.030
and that's going to be on the top right.

106
00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:29.370
The reset and the power button are for the Arduino,

107
00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:31.680
so if you want to reset it so that

108
00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:35.300
the program runs again and if you want to power it off.

109
00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:39.381
So connecting a module,

110
00:07:39.381 --> 00:07:42.680
what you will need is an LED module,

111
00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:45.935
an LED, and a grove connector.

112
00:07:45.935 --> 00:07:50.260
The grove connectors are located in your Mezzanine kit,

113
00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:57.720
and these are four wires

114
00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:01.657
that connect directly to the white ports of the DragonBoard,

115
00:08:01.657 --> 00:08:05.520
and what you want to do is take

116
00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:11.640
your sensor and connect one side of the grove connector to this LED module.

117
00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:13.975
You can find this in the kit as well.

118
00:08:13.975 --> 00:08:16.260
And then the LED module,

119
00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:23.418
you can connect the LED to it and then you can connect the module to your Mezzanine.

120
00:08:23.418 --> 00:08:29.025
So now we'll be connecting an LED module to the DragonBoard and showing you how.

121
00:08:29.025 --> 00:08:34.620
The first thing you want to note is here is the LED module itself and then we have

122
00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:37.410
the LEU to put in the module and

123
00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:41.250
the cable to connect the module to the Sensors Mezzanine.

124
00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:42.285
The first thing we want to do,

125
00:08:42.285 --> 00:08:43.380
as we stated before,

126
00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:46.555
is put the LED into the module.

127
00:08:46.555 --> 00:08:51.105
This won't be the case for most modules because they're self-contained,

128
00:08:51.105 --> 00:08:54.780
but this one happens to let you customize whichever LED you want to use.

129
00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:57.046
If you guys don't know about LED's,

130
00:08:57.046 --> 00:08:59.578
make sure you guys put it on correctly.

131
00:08:59.578 --> 00:09:02.845
You want to put the long one on the plus side,

132
00:09:02.845 --> 00:09:04.280
if you guys don't know already.

133
00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:06.510
Yeah, they're just very specific about it.

134
00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:08.190
Yeah.

135
00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:10.470
Now we have the LCD connected to

136
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:15.050
the module and next we want to put this connector into it.

137
00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:16.215
It doesn't have to be in this order,

138
00:09:16.215 --> 00:09:19.210
but we just explained it this way.

139
00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:22.800
It connects perfectly. And then,

140
00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:26.555
you want to put it into the AB port right there.

141
00:09:26.555 --> 00:09:30.540
And then now you have it connected.

142
00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:33.720
Now this will set you up for our next video which we'll show you guys how to

143
00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:39.255
actually control the LED that's connected to the DragonBoard.

144
00:09:39.255 --> 00:09:42.300
But for now, let's go to some takeaways.

145
00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:47.205
So, we showed you where all the ports are.

146
00:09:47.205 --> 00:09:50.155
So that's important for knowing just where to

147
00:09:50.155 --> 00:09:53.460
connect it to and what we're talking about when we mentioned them in the future.

148
00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:58.350
The next part, we want to make sure you guys understand is that you guys want to

149
00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:00.810
know which ports are connected to the DragonBoard and which ones

150
00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:03.885
are connected to Arduino or the ATmega.

151
00:10:03.885 --> 00:10:06.105
We refer to it both ways.

152
00:10:06.105 --> 00:10:08.940
So make sure you guys know how to use the grove connectors

153
00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:12.859
to link the sensor to your Mezzanine.

154
00:10:12.859 --> 00:10:20.000
So we'll be using this extensively in future videos so be on the lookout for that.
