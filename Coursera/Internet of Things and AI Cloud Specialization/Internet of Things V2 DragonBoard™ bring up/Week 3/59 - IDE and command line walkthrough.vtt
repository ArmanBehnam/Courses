00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.043
Hello everyone. In this video, we'll be going over IDEs

2
00:00:04.043 --> 00:00:08.600
and also how to use a command line to create a simple program.

3
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:15.795
We'll be comparing Text-based IDEs versus GUI-based IDEs or graphical IDEs.

4
00:00:15.795 --> 00:00:19.805
So, for our Text-based example,

5
00:00:19.805 --> 00:00:21.465
we'll be using Vim.

6
00:00:21.465 --> 00:00:24.453
Again this isn't the only option out there.

7
00:00:24.453 --> 00:00:28.700
There's Emacs, Nano, but we're just using this for our example.

8
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.075
And for our GUI-based IDE,

9
00:00:31.075 --> 00:00:33.305
we'll be using Eclipse as our example.

10
00:00:33.305 --> 00:00:38.200
And again, there's other IDEs out there or graphical IDEs out there,

11
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.396
we're just using this one.

12
00:00:39.396 --> 00:00:44.320
And after that, we'll be doing a demo walkthrough of creating a program,

13
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.946
and compiling, and running on using each.

14
00:00:48.946 --> 00:00:52.195
So, Andrew will first start out with talking about

15
00:00:52.195 --> 00:00:57.940
the comparison of Vim to Eclipse. So, yeah.

16
00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:04.145
We'll be comparing a Text-based IDE versus a GUI-based IDE which is a graphical IDE.

17
00:01:04.145 --> 00:01:08.735
And the pros and cons of each and kind of each comparison.

18
00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:12.190
And after that, we'll be doing a demo of creating

19
00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.150
a program and executing it on both the Text-based and GUI-based.

20
00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:17.520
So for our Text-based IDE,

21
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.240
we'll be using Vim.

22
00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.925
This isn't the only one out there.

23
00:01:20.925 --> 00:01:24.220
There's other ones such as Nano and Emacs.

24
00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:25.995
We're just using this for our example.

25
00:01:25.995 --> 00:01:27.730
And for our GUI-based IDE,

26
00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.813
we'll be using Eclipse.

27
00:01:30.813 --> 00:01:31.870
Again, not the only one out there,

28
00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.846
there's other ones, just for our example.

29
00:01:34.846 --> 00:01:40.254
So, I'll let Andrew start out with the description of Vim.

30
00:01:40.254 --> 00:01:45.355
So, one advantage of Vim is that it's faster than

31
00:01:45.355 --> 00:01:51.935
a GUI-based IDE because it doesn't have all the graphical interfaces that Eclipse has.

32
00:01:51.935 --> 00:01:54.355
So it just runs instantaneously,

33
00:01:54.355 --> 00:01:57.205
but it's a little bit more complicated.

34
00:01:57.205 --> 00:01:58.860
There's a learning curve to it.

35
00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.490
There's an argument to be made that it's a little simpler,

36
00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.725
but in most cases, it's more complex.

37
00:02:07.725 --> 00:02:13.440
Another advantage is that a lot of the work will be done on the terminal itself.

38
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:20.095
So, you'll be using the terminal to go through all the files and see where everything is.

39
00:02:20.095 --> 00:02:25.530
So it's more convenient to have everything on the terminal usually.

40
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.365
It is widely recognized.

41
00:02:28.365 --> 00:02:31.020
A lot of companies look for your knowledge of

42
00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.910
Vim and a lot of people expect you to have this knowledge.

43
00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:42.415
So it might be important for you to know Vim or at least know some parts of it.

44
00:02:42.415 --> 00:02:46.665
Another cool thing is that there are many resources

45
00:02:46.665 --> 00:02:51.660
online to help you even though it has a learning curve to it.

46
00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.075
And this will help you get through some of

47
00:02:54.075 --> 00:03:00.115
the troubles that you might have at the beginning of learning Vim.

48
00:03:00.115 --> 00:03:05.785
Another disadvantage to Vim is that you need to learn

49
00:03:05.785 --> 00:03:13.220
all the compilers and the running tools that you might not need in a GUI-based IDE.

50
00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.160
And this is because the GUI-based IDEs already have all these integrated for

51
00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.665
you while in Vim you have to learn about these on your own.

52
00:03:23.665 --> 00:03:27.285
So we'll look at those more when we actually go through the walkthrough.

53
00:03:27.285 --> 00:03:30.415
So I'll be talking about Eclipse. It's much easier to use.

54
00:03:30.415 --> 00:03:35.410
It's more like using like a Word processor than creating a program.

55
00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.625
It's got easy text editors, save buttons.

56
00:03:40.625 --> 00:03:43.930
One benefit is that when you're using a lot

57
00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.010
of functions in different classes and objects,

58
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.590
it helps you autocomplete what you're going to write.

59
00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:58.845
It can think of, you started an "S" so you might do like system or that method.

60
00:03:58.845 --> 00:04:01.455
And it helps deal with dependencies so that's you

61
00:04:01.455 --> 00:04:04.485
doing a large project and you rely on a lot of libraries.

62
00:04:04.485 --> 00:04:08.975
It helps you just quickly import those so you can use them.

63
00:04:08.975 --> 00:04:13.155
There are many options to choose from again. Eclipse isn't the only one.

64
00:04:13.155 --> 00:04:19.965
So, you can use your favorite search engine and find the one that's right for you.

65
00:04:19.965 --> 00:04:21.960
It's a simple option to run the program often.

66
00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:25.880
Oftentimes, it's just clicking on the Play or Run button and then it

67
00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.170
compiles and runs it for you and shows the output right there.

68
00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:36.410
We'll be going over a demo and Andrew will be taking over the Vim demo.

69
00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.655
So, before we go on this demo,

70
00:04:39.655 --> 00:04:43.260
we would like to notify you guys that this isn't a Vim tutorial.

71
00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:47.305
It's just showing you the pros of Vim and the cons of Vim.

72
00:04:47.305 --> 00:04:50.490
So, if you want to learn more about Vim itself,

73
00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.220
we will be talking about some resources later.

74
00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:54.900
So, to get started,

75
00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.350
we want to type in Vim,

76
00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:03.270
followed by the name of the file to open the file or to create a file.

77
00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:09.555
So we created a file called, helloworld.java already.

78
00:05:09.555 --> 00:05:13.450
So, here's the "Hello World" application.

79
00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:18.505
So there are two modes to Vim. There is the command mode and the insert mode.

80
00:05:18.505 --> 00:05:24.495
And the command mode basically allows you to copy paste text,

81
00:05:24.495 --> 00:05:28.760
save the file, quit the file and more commands.

82
00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:33.805
The insert mode actually allows you to insert text into the document.

83
00:05:33.805 --> 00:05:41.700
So, we are in command mode and we want to get to insert mode,

84
00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.360
so we would be pressing either A or I.

85
00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.240
So let's press "I" to get to insert mode.

86
00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.475
And, as you can see in the lower left-hand corner,

87
00:05:50.475 --> 00:05:52.670
there's the word "Insert."

88
00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:56.220
So this means that we are able to insert text into the file.

89
00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.695
So let's enter some text.

90
00:05:58.695 --> 00:06:04.440
And, as you can see that something is written on the file itself and it's just gibberish.

91
00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:08.010
But Vim, unlike other IDEs,

92
00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:10.555
won't tell you like that.

93
00:06:10.555 --> 00:06:13.510
It isn't a valid statement,

94
00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:17.600
so let's just delete it as we don't want this in our code.

95
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.815
And then, to save the file,

96
00:06:20.815 --> 00:06:25.320
we want to go back to command mode and to do this in our insert mode,

97
00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:28.560
we would just press "Escape" and then we would

98
00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:32.820
type in colon W as it shows in the lower left-hand corner.

99
00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:36.085
And this stands for writing to the file,

100
00:06:36.085 --> 00:06:39.035
a.k.a save the file.

101
00:06:39.035 --> 00:06:41.975
And then, to quit the file,

102
00:06:41.975 --> 00:06:44.295
we can press colon q,

103
00:06:44.295 --> 00:06:47.805
and q stands for quit obviously.

104
00:06:47.805 --> 00:06:51.523
And then, we can just quit the file.

105
00:06:51.523 --> 00:06:56.705
And then, you can type colon wq to save and exit at the same time.

106
00:06:56.705 --> 00:07:00.840
But, we just wanted to show what each command did.

107
00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.863
And then, to run the file,

108
00:07:02.863 --> 00:07:06.770
you would actually have to use one of our compilers.

109
00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:12.695
The default compiler for Java is javac.

110
00:07:12.695 --> 00:07:18.190
As we type that in-.

111
00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:24.055
Picked up Java options.

112
00:07:24.055 --> 00:07:32.005
And this created an executable file called 'Hello World,' in our helloworld.class,

113
00:07:32.005 --> 00:07:36.720
in our directory and we will just run

114
00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:44.545
this through Java, helloWorld.class.

115
00:07:44.545 --> 00:07:48.320
Oh, I think you're missing, you're not supposed.class, that's what I think.

116
00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:48.820
Okay.

117
00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:50.820
Yeah. I've done that a lot when programming in Java.

118
00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:53.290
So, we just type in java helloWorld,

119
00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:55.594
my bad, and it types in Hello World.

120
00:07:55.594 --> 00:07:56.694
Yeah. There we go.

121
00:07:56.694 --> 00:08:00.465
So, we just saw Andrew create and

122
00:08:00.465 --> 00:08:04.395
compile and run a program using Vim in the command line.

123
00:08:04.395 --> 00:08:07.780
So, I'll be going over the same thing but using Eclipse and I

124
00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:11.770
guess giving you a little bit more insight on like what it's like to use an ID.

125
00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:15.045
So, we already have installed it but if you want to install yourself,

126
00:08:15.045 --> 00:08:21.232
you would have to type in, sudo apt-get install Eclipse.

127
00:08:21.232 --> 00:08:24.345
So, this just uses the built-in package manager, APT.

128
00:08:24.345 --> 00:08:25.975
We will be talking about that more later.

129
00:08:25.975 --> 00:08:31.095
But for now, just look at this as just the way you install Eclipse.

130
00:08:31.095 --> 00:08:32.352
So since we have already installed it,

131
00:08:32.352 --> 00:08:36.925
we don't go through that step and we just type in 'Eclipse' and enter.

132
00:08:36.925 --> 00:08:40.150
And as you can see already, it's in a loading screen because it takes

133
00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:46.603
a lot more memory and more processing power to create.

134
00:08:46.603 --> 00:08:51.677
So, that was just choosing your working directory and just choose the default one.

135
00:08:51.677 --> 00:08:55.135
This is very different from Vim, it's not instant.

136
00:08:55.135 --> 00:08:56.875
But you'll see why,

137
00:08:56.875 --> 00:08:59.828
with all the extra tools that it allows you to use. So, I'll just take the mouse.

138
00:08:59.828 --> 00:09:02.768
Yeah.

139
00:09:02.768 --> 00:09:06.930
This is really taking a while.

140
00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:12.760
Yeah. Honestly, for using Vim, let's see.

141
00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:18.178
But what' we're going going to show you guys what it's like to use an Eclipse or an IDE.

142
00:09:18.178 --> 00:09:22.600
So, here we have this program,

143
00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:25.020
this already made program.

144
00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:29.225
It's basically the same as what Andrew just created and or ran before.

145
00:09:29.225 --> 00:09:35.150
But first, I just want to show you guys how you would create a project, just a quick way.

146
00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:37.065
I remember when I first used Eclipse.

147
00:09:37.065 --> 00:09:38.690
This is kind of a hard thing.

148
00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:42.240
So, you just right click on the Project Explorer over here.

149
00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:44.780
That's essentially just like a Follow Explorer so

150
00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:47.555
they can see all the files that's in our current directory

151
00:09:47.555 --> 00:09:54.270
and then create a new project and I will tell you what product you want to create.

152
00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:58.645
So, we went through the Java Project and do Next.

153
00:09:58.645 --> 00:10:01.850
And then just type in what project name you want.

154
00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:04.542
So, let's say, "HelloProject."

155
00:10:04.542 --> 00:10:08.304
And then just press Finish.

156
00:10:08.304 --> 00:10:10.545
This is just some,

157
00:10:10.545 --> 00:10:12.355
if you run this and see this yourselves,

158
00:10:12.355 --> 00:10:13.870
this is some perspective thing.

159
00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:15.685
It's kind of like a view. You really

160
00:10:15.685 --> 00:10:17.120
don't need to worry about this. I will just click 'No.'

161
00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:19.135
And then, there we go.

162
00:10:19.135 --> 00:10:23.140
We have a new project right there.

163
00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:26.505
Yeah. So, if you want,

164
00:10:26.505 --> 00:10:30.540
you can go in here and go to the source file, and then,

165
00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:34.425
you create a new package,

166
00:10:34.425 --> 00:10:37.307
and you just create the package name.

167
00:10:37.307 --> 00:10:41.760
So, 'hello.' And then, in the package,

168
00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:45.080
it's a bit more steps than what Andrew had to go through

169
00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:50.375
but this is just the organization that they prefer to program.

170
00:10:50.375 --> 00:10:52.062
And then, just go to New,

171
00:10:52.062 --> 00:10:57.056
Class. Yeah, there we go.

172
00:10:57.056 --> 00:11:05.640
New class and then just the name the class. Whoops.

173
00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:07.730
I think the classes are already created.

174
00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:10.210
Oh, yeah. We have our example class.

175
00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:13.028
I was just see, how to create a new one.

176
00:11:13.028 --> 00:11:14.300
So yeah, that's how you create the class.

177
00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:20.290
So, we're going into our example projects and to show you guys it already running.

178
00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:23.380
So, this is our project right here.

179
00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:25.165
As you can see here, it has a package.

180
00:11:25.165 --> 00:11:27.385
We defined this earlier when we created it.

181
00:11:27.385 --> 00:11:32.379
Not exactly right then. This is a pre-built one and we have all this.

182
00:11:32.379 --> 00:11:36.630
So, I'm going to add one more line so you guys can see what it's like to use an IDE.

183
00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:42.715
So as you can see here, system, if you want to add like say, "Hello Projects" also.

184
00:11:42.715 --> 00:11:45.025
And then, you can see here. Yeah, that's one benefit

185
00:11:45.025 --> 00:11:47.316
of an IDE. It auto-completes for you.

186
00:11:47.316 --> 00:11:51.235
You can see all these things that you can add.

187
00:11:51.235 --> 00:11:52.850
So, I want to choose Out.

188
00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:55.349
So, you can see that's the only other option that. That just starts with 'O'.

189
00:11:55.349 --> 00:11:59.230
Press enter and then you just continue.

190
00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:02.650
And then, print line. Oh, I do not want to actually do print.

191
00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:05.200
So, we're going to do, that was just one of

192
00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:09.875
the default options because it didn't add the line and there we go.

193
00:12:09.875 --> 00:12:16.110
Hello Projects Again.

194
00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:18.705
Now, and as you can see here,

195
00:12:18.705 --> 00:12:21.510
I didn't actually end it with a semicolon. That was on purpose.

196
00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:23.840
It's just to show you to highlight one of the benefits of

197
00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:27.045
this IDE is that it tells you that there's an error here.

198
00:12:27.045 --> 00:12:28.685
And so that, like I mean,

199
00:12:28.685 --> 00:12:30.880
how many times have you compiled a program and realized,

200
00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:33.030
"Oh, I missed a semicolon somewhere."

201
00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:35.365
So, this checks it for you right away.

202
00:12:35.365 --> 00:12:39.136
So, you can just correct it right there.

203
00:12:39.136 --> 00:12:42.060
So, we just add the semicolon. Error goes away.

204
00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:43.114
Now we want to run it.

205
00:12:43.114 --> 00:12:47.185
So, we just go up to run.

206
00:12:47.185 --> 00:12:49.220
So, you just see this, you just click run,

207
00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:55.434
and press OK. Yeah.

208
00:12:55.434 --> 00:12:59.300
As you can see,

209
00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:01.880
our output is right Here.

210
00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:04.937
Hello World,.even on the other line.

211
00:13:04.937 --> 00:13:08.820
So, this is essentially the same as what Andrew just went through.

212
00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:12.590
This compiled the program for us it just ran it right away,

213
00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:14.278
and even showed us output right there.

214
00:13:14.278 --> 00:13:16.140
So, this is just a benefit of this ID.

215
00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:17.980
Okay.

216
00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:22.580
So, we all have more tutorials and the readings.

217
00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:27.005
This will be provided and the course area itself.

218
00:13:27.005 --> 00:13:29.370
We're not showing you all of the things that you can do

219
00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:32.030
with the Eclipse and Vim as that will take some time.

220
00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:36.390
So, make sure you guys read up.

221
00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:39.870
Yeah. So, I guess it's been kind of a long videos.

222
00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:42.480
We want to do some takeaways, just things to remember.

223
00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:49.280
So, we did read and write and execute code to the command line using Vim.

224
00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:51.015
That was our tool using command line.

225
00:13:51.015 --> 00:13:55.568
And we also did it with IE using Eclipse.

226
00:13:55.568 --> 00:13:56.790
We did the same thing,

227
00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:58.760
you saw the differences,

228
00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:02.827
and Andrew say... Next line.

229
00:14:02.827 --> 00:14:06.770
So, there are many options of IDs.

230
00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:09.431
As we mentioned earlier, Vim,

231
00:14:09.431 --> 00:14:12.390
many clips aren't the only options that you

232
00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:17.245
have and each one of them have their own advantages and disadvantages.

233
00:14:17.245 --> 00:14:21.950
We just went over just the general advantages and disadvantages.

234
00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:25.620
Yeah. So, as we saw from the demos in general,

235
00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:29.410
the text-based is usually faster just because it's not as much to load.

236
00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:30.765
But it is harder to learn,

237
00:14:30.765 --> 00:14:34.180
as you are to learn those like just these 3 commands just to write,

238
00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:37.150
save, and quit the file.

239
00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:43.765
And then the GUI-based was a little slower as you saw earlier.

240
00:14:43.765 --> 00:14:47.285
It took like about a minute to load

241
00:14:47.285 --> 00:14:53.185
and if you're looking for like a performance based ID,

242
00:14:53.185 --> 00:14:54.925
this might not be the best choice.

243
00:14:54.925 --> 00:14:56.665
But it is easy to learn.

244
00:14:56.665 --> 00:14:58.605
You can just get right into it.

245
00:14:58.605 --> 00:15:07.210
Start coding right away and we'll be talking about this topic more in a future video.

246
00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:08.000
Yeah.
