1
00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.270
So we went over some of the operating
systems that you can download for

2
00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:06.990
your DragonBoard and
how to build them from source.

3
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:13.530
So let's get into the assigned homework
to give you guys some work to do.

4
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.600
So for the first one we want you
to download VMWare Player or

5
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.070
Fusion and
you can find this on the VMWare website.

6
00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.810
We'll show you how to
download VMWare Player, but

7
00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.370
for Fusion, it should be the same thing.

8
00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:34.777
So for Fusion,
it's the VMWare version for Macs,

9
00:00:34.777 --> 00:00:40.147
and Player is for Linux and Windows users.

10
00:00:40.147 --> 00:00:43.411
So then after you get the your VMWare
set up we want you to read all

11
00:00:43.411 --> 00:00:47.500
the instructions for building from source
for each of the operating systems.

12
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.860
>> Android, OpenEmbedded, and Debian,
just understand how to do it.

13
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.404
And then after you understand how to do
it, we want you to build the images for

14
00:00:56.404 --> 00:00:58.110
each of them and after that.

15
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.777
>> Yeah, then we want you guys to go
to the main websites for Android,

16
00:01:03.777 --> 00:01:05.600
OpenEmbedded and Debian.

17
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:13.050
I'll show you how to navigate through them
after we go over just the overview of it.

18
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.681
The reason why we want you guys to do
this is to familiarize yourself with all

19
00:01:17.681 --> 00:01:19.236
the operating systems.

20
00:01:19.236 --> 00:01:23.342
We just don't want you to go through all
the work of downloading the operating

21
00:01:23.342 --> 00:01:27.580
system and using an operating system
that might not even fit your needs.

22
00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.650
So make sure you guys download
the right operating system.

23
00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.960
And then next we want you to
explore is BitBake targets and

24
00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.050
these are targets that allow you to
customize your OpenEmbedded versions.

25
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.010
So if you remember in one
of the previous videos,

26
00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.270
we went over how to build
OpenEmbedded from source.

27
00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.240
And one of the last steps was
to use BitBake to create maybe

28
00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:01.950
an X11 GPU-accelerated version of
your OpenEmbedded or something else.

29
00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.450
So we just wanted you guys to just go and

30
00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.100
look at what other customizations
you guys might find online.

31
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.550
Just use your favorite search
engine to look for more.

32
00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:21.080
So let's go to the screencast to see some
of the specifications that I talked about.

33
00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.600
So the first one is here, here

34
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:33.235
if you see,
hereâ€™s the download VMware website.

35
00:02:33.235 --> 00:02:36.300
And you can just go to the site and

36
00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.960
look at all the different
products that you can find.

37
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:45.383
So for this one we want you to
just download the latest one, 7.0.

38
00:02:45.383 --> 00:02:49.490
If you try to download 5.0, for
my computer, it didn't work.

39
00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.990
So it might be the same for your guys', so

40
00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:58.394
we just want you to take it safe and
just download VMware 7.0.

41
00:02:58.394 --> 00:03:03.209
If you guys already have
a VMware Virtual Machine Player,

42
00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.840
then it will most likely
tell you to uninstall it.

43
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.320
If you don't want this to happen,

44
00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.590
then just use the VM player
that you already have.

45
00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.430
So the second part we wanted to
specify is the Debian website,

46
00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.840
which you can access through debian.org.

47
00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.170
And we just want you to click on
about Debian and just read about it.

48
00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:33.541
So here is one of the stuff we went over
in the previous video which basically

49
00:03:33.541 --> 00:03:38.980
meant that Debian is mostly
composed of free software.

50
00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.428
And that's why it has in big letters,
it's all free.

51
00:03:43.428 --> 00:03:46.101
One of the major parts of Debian, so

52
00:03:46.101 --> 00:03:50.120
make sure you guys read up on that and
Android as well.

53
00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.190
So why Android?

54
00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.910
So you guys can see some of the reasons
why you might choose Android.

55
00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.270
So, you can just click on Play.

56
00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:02.160
And the Google Play Store, as we mentioned
in the previous video, is also a huge part

57
00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.980
of why people use Android, is because of
the big Android market that's available.

58
00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.826
And then, here we have OpenEmbedded and

59
00:04:11.826 --> 00:04:15.781
this is a Wiki page that is
pretty easy to navigate through.

60
00:04:15.781 --> 00:04:21.206
We just want you to look at maybe
like frequently asked questions and

61
00:04:21.206 --> 00:04:24.370
then, yeah just read up on that.

62
00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:30.070
And yeah that's it for building
from source an operating system and

63
00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.150
we hope you guys learned a lot,
and we'll see you guys next time.
