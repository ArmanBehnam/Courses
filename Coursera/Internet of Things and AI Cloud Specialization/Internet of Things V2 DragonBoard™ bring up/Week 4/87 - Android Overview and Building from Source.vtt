00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.020
Hello everyone. In this video,

2
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.965
we'll be going over Android and how to build it from Source.

3
00:00:07.965 --> 00:00:10.810
So, as Simon mentioned,

4
00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:13.390
we're going to describe what Android is and then,

5
00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:18.315
we're going to go into the procedure for building it from Source.

6
00:00:18.315 --> 00:00:21.660
So, just again a brief description,

7
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.340
if you guys haven't heard of Android,

8
00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.155
it's an operating system intended for mobile phones and tablets,

9
00:00:28.155 --> 00:00:32.025
and it is one of the two most popular OS's for mobile devices,

10
00:00:32.025 --> 00:00:34.720
the other being iOS.

11
00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.085
And is based on a Linux kernel,

12
00:00:38.085 --> 00:00:42.885
and an easy app development which has a large market

13
00:00:42.885 --> 00:00:45.325
because of somebody felt that they're running Android.

14
00:00:45.325 --> 00:00:49.160
It's more widely used than Debian or OpenEmbedded simply because it's on

15
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.620
mobile phones and there's more mobile phones than computers,

16
00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.890
and Interface is intended for touch screen,

17
00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.810
but it can still be used on the DragonBoard,

18
00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:02.935
you can still use as a keyboard and mouse too.

19
00:01:02.935 --> 00:01:06.570
So, here's the procedure.

20
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.220
If you guys watched the previous two videos,

21
00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.650
these bullet points should be just really

22
00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.785
familiar to you guys but we're just going to reiterate it.

23
00:01:15.785 --> 00:01:19.795
The first one is you want to familiarize yourself with fastboot,

24
00:01:19.795 --> 00:01:22.765
and this is how you're going to get the image

25
00:01:22.765 --> 00:01:26.220
that you built from source onto your DragonBoard.

26
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.650
So, make sure you go into the instructions that we provided

27
00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.175
for fastboot and look at steps one through four to set it up.

28
00:01:35.175 --> 00:01:39.400
And then, we will also provide a 96Boards instruction website.

29
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:45.545
We'll provide to actually for this one and just follow these.

30
00:01:45.545 --> 00:01:49.915
I'll show you how to navigate through them in a bit.

31
00:01:49.915 --> 00:01:52.630
And, here are some important things to know.

32
00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.930
Android is big just like

33
00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:01.315
Debian was so you want to make sure that you have enough space in your computer.

34
00:02:01.315 --> 00:02:03.480
When I was downloading it,

35
00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.485
it took like nearly 14 gigabytes,

36
00:02:06.485 --> 00:02:08.190
so it's really really big.

37
00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:15.050
You want to have a virtual machine that can handle that size of operating system.

38
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.010
And the same thing as Debian,

39
00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.480
when you install the GCC cross compiler,

40
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.545
it will be in your bin folder not the actual GCC compiler directory.

41
00:02:27.545 --> 00:02:30.400
And also, all in the instructions,

42
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.405
it says to create these two directories,

43
00:02:33.405 --> 00:02:35.395
Kernel Top and Android Top,

44
00:02:35.395 --> 00:02:41.080
and you can just create a new directory you want with names that you can remember.

45
00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.575
We just called it Kernel and Android.

46
00:02:45.575 --> 00:02:49.880
Let's go to our laptop to look at some of the instructions.

47
00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.900
Okay, so here we are at

48
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:58.540
our first instruction website and this is how we will build Android from Source.

49
00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.190
This is a project that was created to assist us.

50
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.280
So, first you want to make the project itself.

51
00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:13.435
So, we provided you the repositories and how to build it.

52
00:03:13.435 --> 00:03:18.410
So here you would build AOSP which is the project name and afterwards,

53
00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.800
you would build Kernel and if you see, if you scroll down,

54
00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.580
you would see that it tells you to make cross compile.

55
00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.685
So, instead of aarch Android gnu,

56
00:03:30.685 --> 00:03:36.965
we recommend you go on the instructions for Debian again and then, just scroll up,

57
00:03:36.965 --> 00:03:38.270
scroll down I mean,

58
00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:46.920
and you'll see that it gives you a link for the Linaro GCC cross compiler so,

59
00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.330
we want you to replace this with the path to that compiler.

60
00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.470
So if you go to our Ubuntu host machine,

61
00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:08.705
you will see that the directory will be provided inside our,

62
00:04:08.705 --> 00:04:13.150
I mean, I put the directory inside my Downloads folder,

63
00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:19.225
so let's just go in there and here's the GCC compiler that I myself

64
00:04:19.225 --> 00:04:24.400
extracted from the XXC file,

65
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.060
XC file and then afterwards,

66
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.290
if you want to go into your bin folder.

67
00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:34.370
So, if you go back and then at last,

68
00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:39.560
you will see that specific thing isn't available here.

69
00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:44.270
So you want to actually see the entire bin folder and then,

70
00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:45.580
the files all here,

71
00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:50.150
you will see that all the executables are in here instead.

72
00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:56.235
So, when you sorry,

73
00:04:56.235 --> 00:04:58.845
let's just go back.

74
00:04:58.845 --> 00:05:08.610
When you, sorry, I'm just looking for the command that I did, never mind.

75
00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:15.760
So, let's just go back here and then you see that cross compile equals aarc.

76
00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:20.535
All you want to do is you just want to pwd, and then,

77
00:05:20.535 --> 00:05:28.290
you will see that it's dash home and then dash andrew and afterwards,

78
00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:30.950
you want to put the path which is downloads and then,

79
00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:35.110
the GCC compiler name and then afterwards,

80
00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:37.740
you want to put backslash bin and then,

81
00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:44.725
you want to put aarc dash linux dash gnu instead.

82
00:05:44.725 --> 00:05:52.335
So, like the instructions for this assumes that you have an Android compiler yourself,

83
00:05:52.335 --> 00:05:54.810
but we don't really provide you one so,

84
00:05:54.810 --> 00:06:00.625
we just recommend that you go to the Debian website to download your own cross compiler.

85
00:06:00.625 --> 00:06:06.950
And then afterwards, you want to make the image itself and then,

86
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:10.835
here we see the less than Android top greater than sign,

87
00:06:10.835 --> 00:06:13.910
and we want you to replace every single instance of

88
00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:17.790
Kernel top and Android top with your own name.

89
00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:22.160
So, what we did was we just called it Kernel without

90
00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:26.930
any capital letters and without the less than and greater than sign.

91
00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:33.860
So, in here you would just do a cd Kernel and then,

92
00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:38.080
in here you are just to Android in our case.

93
00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:43.145
But, just call it whatever is comfortable for you guys and easy for you guys to remember,

94
00:06:43.145 --> 00:06:49.465
and that's all the clarification style I need to provide you guys and,

95
00:06:49.465 --> 00:06:54.310
we just have fun with that I guess,

96
00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:57.000
and we all see you guys next time.
