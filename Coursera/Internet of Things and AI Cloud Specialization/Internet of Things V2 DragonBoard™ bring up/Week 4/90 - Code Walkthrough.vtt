00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:01.610
Hello guys.

2
00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:04.990
So we're going to go
over some of the code for

3
00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:10.830
Google Assistants Push to Talk file
that we ran in the previous video.

4
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.140
So let's go into our terminal and
let's go into the program.

5
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.150
And I'll give it off to Simon
to explain the first part.

6
00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.686
>> So the first part is just all
the libraries that you'll need,

7
00:00:23.686 --> 00:00:26.474
so you'll need just json,
logging, grpc, and

8
00:00:26.474 --> 00:00:29.876
a bunch of Google libraries to
communicate with their API.

9
00:00:29.876 --> 00:00:33.501
The next part, as you can see, is just
a bunch of constants that we need and

10
00:00:33.501 --> 00:00:35.796
then here we have
the class SampleAssistant.

11
00:00:35.796 --> 00:00:39.850
So this'll be the Google
assistant itself and we have just

12
00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.899
the initializing method just for
the object itself when you create it and

13
00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:49.051
then some helper methods for
entering and exiting the bot.

14
00:00:49.051 --> 00:00:53.849
And then next one is just checking for
an error or if it's unavailable, and

15
00:00:53.849 --> 00:00:57.518
the next part's when we
actually interact with the bot.

16
00:00:57.518 --> 00:00:59.760
So we print out all the stuff
to the terminal and

17
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.840
all the interactions that we have with it.

18
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.440
And finally after that large method,
we have the generate converse request, so

19
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.560
this is actually sending the audio and
the requests and

20
00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.940
messages to the Google API and
getting the responses back.

21
00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.500
>> So the next part is to get all
the credentials that you need.

22
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:30.150
And other specific Google parts
that you need in order to run this.

23
00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.970
And you also need to have an audio
playback and capture mechanic

24
00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.670
such as the microphone
on our USB webcam or

25
00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.680
the HDMI output through your TV or
whatever you're using.

26
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:51.190
So this is the part where you actually
interact with those different parts and

27
00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.390
where it says, you're missing this one
part, so make sure you have that with you.

28
00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.000
So the next part is the main itself and

29
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.340
if you guys don't know what a main method
is, it's the one that actually runs

30
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.470
every single method,
every single function that you've written.

31
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.640
And it's the one that controls everything.

32
00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:20.270
So first thing it wants you to do is
try opening your Google credentials.

33
00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.000
This is what you set up
with your Google Cloud and

34
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.526
with the json file and everything.

35
00:02:29.526 --> 00:02:35.659
If it doesn't, then it will throw an
exception and afterwards it's initializing

36
00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:41.367
the GRPC channel which we mentioned was
during most of the audio processing.

37
00:02:41.367 --> 00:02:46.199
And then afterwards we want to
configure your devices, so

38
00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:50.590
your ear microphone and your speakers.

39
00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.030
And then afterwards, we're actually
creating the conversation stream between

40
00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.880
your input and your output.

41
00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:06.660
And then afterwards, we're just
running the Sample Assistant program.

42
00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.778
And that pretty much concludes
our code walkthrough,

43
00:03:09.778 --> 00:03:11.730
this is just the basic code walkthrough.

44
00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.760
If you guys want to know more about
individual parts of this, just let us know

45
00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.880
or you can check out the 96 Port's
open hours for questions as well.

46
00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.600
In the next video, we'll go over
some assigned homeworks dealing with

47
00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.230
Google Assistant and we will see you then.
