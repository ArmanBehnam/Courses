00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.330
So guys, this will be our assigned homework for Google Assistant,

2
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.552
and here are some of the things we want you to do.

3
00:00:09.552 --> 00:00:11.975
Okay, now to start off so you get

4
00:00:11.975 --> 00:00:15.170
a better understanding of how everything in this project work,

5
00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.980
we want you guys to browse to the Google Assistant website and go through,

6
00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.670
see how the assistant works and just like the idea behind it.

7
00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.750
And then also go through the to Github for Google Assistant,

8
00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.700
so you can understand, you can like see some of

9
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.060
the code and see actually what's happening behind the scenes.

10
00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.030
Afterwards, we want you to go to

11
00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.263
instructions page and just read it over again before proceeding.

12
00:00:38.263 --> 00:00:42.075
There are some intricate details that you might want to go over before,

13
00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:45.385
that we haven't covered that are on this instructions page.

14
00:00:45.385 --> 00:00:49.785
Afterwards, we want you to follow the instructions and run Google Assistant itself,

15
00:00:49.785 --> 00:00:54.140
and we want you guys to test Google Assistant with simple requests like saying,

16
00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.411
Oh hello, how's your day?

17
00:00:56.411 --> 00:01:00.760
Thanks, sorry, and stuff like that.

18
00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.971
This is important because we might actually put some of the answers to Google,

19
00:01:04.971 --> 00:01:10.315
some of the answers that Google Assistant might tell us on future assessments.

20
00:01:10.315 --> 00:01:14.505
So, make sure you guys actually run the program.

21
00:01:14.505 --> 00:01:17.990
Afterwards so we want to just go to a pushtotalk.py,

22
00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.860
the actual file, and look at what the code,

23
00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.780
each individual thing does.

24
00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.130
And if you guys want,

25
00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.590
then you guys can customize the code as well.

26
00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.520
So, make sure you guys do all this and it will

27
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.450
definitely raise your knowledge of

28
00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.090
Google Assistant and how to use it effectively with the drag import.

29
00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:48.000
So, that concludes our video and we will see you in the next video.
