00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.420
Welcome everyone. In this video,

2
00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:04.415
we'll be going over the Google Assistant Project,

3
00:00:04.415 --> 00:00:07.418
describing it and showing the execution of it.

4
00:00:07.418 --> 00:00:11.630
So first, let's just show a brief overview of what we're going to do.

5
00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:16.130
So again, we're going to do hardware requirements, then a description,

6
00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:18.350
instructions, and then after that we're going to do

7
00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.930
the execution of the project and show a demo of it.

8
00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:26.290
So moving on, we have our hardware requirements first, so obviously,

9
00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.280
we need a DragonBoard and we need internet access for sure,

10
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.240
because we need to access Google's API.

11
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.313
Then, we need a keyboard and mouse to interact with the DragonBoard,

12
00:00:35.313 --> 00:00:37.453
and then monitor to see what's happening,

13
00:00:37.453 --> 00:00:39.750
and then we need speakers.

14
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.890
You'd have to get the HDMI output from the monitor

15
00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.835
or the audio out for the monitor or if

16
00:00:44.835 --> 00:00:47.265
your monitor already has speakers, that's great too.

17
00:00:47.265 --> 00:00:51.520
But this is so that we can hear Google Assistant talk to us.

18
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.285
The last thing we need is a microphone.

19
00:00:53.285 --> 00:00:56.930
In this case, we're using our USB webcam as a microphone because it has one built-in,

20
00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.480
and we're going to move on to our next part,

21
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.590
which is the instructions and Andrew will take care of that.

22
00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.945
So, the instructions are provided in the readings

23
00:01:05.945 --> 00:01:09.755
and then we wanted to give credit to the person who wrote it,

24
00:01:09.755 --> 00:01:13.460
which is of 96Boards and that's Radhika Paralkar,

25
00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.690
excuse me if I pronounced that incorrectly, and Google also.

26
00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.435
So the code itself is made by Google and

27
00:01:21.435 --> 00:01:26.480
some important things to know in the instructions are the following.

28
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.950
When restarting the laptop,

29
00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:33.470
you have to rerun "source venv/bin/activate" and that's because you have to

30
00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.305
run this in a virtual environment and if you guys

31
00:01:36.305 --> 00:01:39.825
don't do that then some of the instructions won't work.

32
00:01:39.825 --> 00:01:43.515
So make sure you guys do this every single time you restart it.

33
00:01:43.515 --> 00:01:45.680
Another thing to note is,

34
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.480
you have to remember the path to your.json files and

35
00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:54.440
the instructions it asked you to download the key and the key as a.json file.

36
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:59.455
So make sure you remember where that is.

37
00:01:59.455 --> 00:02:05.055
Another thing is, make sure to change the audio settings and PulseAudio Volume Control.

38
00:02:05.055 --> 00:02:08.750
I'll show you how to do this later.

39
00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.810
Basically, you want to change the inputs so that it takes into webcam as

40
00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.190
input and you want to change the output so that the HDMI is output.

41
00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.230
And another thing is, we had trouble with some of the dependencies

42
00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.870
and we just deleted some of the lines of the code and it started to work.

43
00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:36.245
So if you have this same error where it doesn't know which libraries is importing then,

44
00:02:36.245 --> 00:02:38.475
you can do the same fix that I did,

45
00:02:38.475 --> 00:02:41.325
and I'll show you this through the DragonBoard as well.

46
00:02:41.325 --> 00:02:45.680
Let's get into our DragonBoard to see which steps

47
00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.898
you guys need to do before we run this program.

48
00:02:49.898 --> 00:02:51.515
So the first thing we want to do is,

49
00:02:51.515 --> 00:02:55.775
we want to go to sound video and then PulseAudio Volume Control.

50
00:02:55.775 --> 00:03:02.960
And, this might be hard to see but as you can see in the output devices,

51
00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.240
you want to specify HDMI output,

52
00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.510
and you want it to display all output devices here.

53
00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.210
And in input devices,

54
00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:16.970
you also want it to show all input devices and you want to make sure that this one

55
00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:23.275
is checked for the webcam.

56
00:03:23.275 --> 00:03:25.955
So, as you can see it's not checked for the webcam.

57
00:03:25.955 --> 00:03:32.693
So you guys can just click on this one and exit out of the PulseAudio.

58
00:03:32.693 --> 00:03:34.930
And then, let's go into our terminal to

59
00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:41.863
see some of the stuff that you need to fix in the terminal as well.

60
00:03:41.863 --> 00:03:45.885
So let's open up Q Terminal,

61
00:03:45.885 --> 00:03:48.010
and then let's go to our project directory.

62
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.970
So, it'll tell you to name your directory New Project.

63
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:53.625
So, that's what we called it as well.

64
00:03:53.625 --> 00:03:59.035
And then if you ls, you'll see all the files here and their compiled files as well.

65
00:03:59.035 --> 00:04:07.710
And then, if you just go to pushtotalk.py. Oh Sorry.

66
00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:11.250
I'll open this in "vim" so you guys can see.

67
00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.797
My bad.

68
00:04:16.797 --> 00:04:21.470
So, before there were lines of code that says,

69
00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.440
"From that import. "

70
00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.420
Well, it says, "Try and from that import."

71
00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:30.050
And it sees if it works that way and if it doesn't,

72
00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.165
it does this step anyways.

73
00:04:32.165 --> 00:04:33.530
So, what you can do is,

74
00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:40.232
you can delete that entire part and you can just unindent

75
00:04:40.232 --> 00:04:42.020
these so that they're at

76
00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:47.775
the far left-hand side of your Python file and then it should work fine.

77
00:04:47.775 --> 00:04:51.485
This is only if you are having trouble with the imports.

78
00:04:51.485 --> 00:04:56.296
So, let's run this program to see what it actually does.

79
00:04:56.296 --> 00:05:01.310
So, let's run Python pushtotalk.py.

80
00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:10.650
So, I forgot the step where you have to run this into virtual environment, like I said.

81
00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:20.320
So you have to go back and you have to run source venv/bin/activate.

82
00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.930
As you can see on the left-hand side it shows venv and then,

83
00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:32.290
let's cd entire new project again and let's run that program once more.

84
00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:35.895
As you can see, there are no errors.

85
00:05:35.895 --> 00:05:37.645
So, as for requests,

86
00:05:37.645 --> 00:05:44.030
so let's press enter and then let's just say, "Hello?"

87
00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:46.280
Hey, I'm having the craziest day.

88
00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.620
I just learned that bananas are curved because they grow towards the sun.

89
00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:49.738
Wait what? Really?

90
00:05:49.738 --> 00:05:56.230
So, as you can see, it responded in some manner.

91
00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:57.355
I found a few places.

92
00:05:57.355 --> 00:05:57.581
The first one is Bibigo Fresh Korean Kitchen at 2525 La Jolla Village Drive in San Diego.

93
00:05:57.581 --> 00:06:05.550
So apparently, I can't say anything because Google,

94
00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:07.255
this thing keeps interrupting me,

95
00:06:07.255 --> 00:06:08.795
but you guys get the idea.

96
00:06:08.795 --> 00:06:10.765
So, if you just say something,

97
00:06:10.765 --> 00:06:13.019
it'll respond in some manner and then,

98
00:06:13.019 --> 00:06:16.630
sometimes they won't hear correctly because I was just like,

99
00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:19.908
not talking to her but talking to you guys.

100
00:06:19.908 --> 00:06:22.845
But make sure you guys run this,

101
00:06:22.845 --> 00:06:27.700
implement it in your own programs, and yeah.

102
00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:31.310
In the next video, we'll show you how the code works.
