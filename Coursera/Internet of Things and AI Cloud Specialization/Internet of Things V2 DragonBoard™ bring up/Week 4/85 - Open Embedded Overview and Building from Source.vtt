00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:05.300
Hello. So this is going to start our series of

2
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.649
how to build operating systems from source.

3
00:00:08.649 --> 00:00:12.710
And our first video is going to cover OpenEmbedded.

4
00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:17.045
So just a brief overview of what we're actually going to do.

5
00:00:17.045 --> 00:00:20.335
We're going to start off with a description of what OpenEmbedded is.

6
00:00:20.335 --> 00:00:22.175
And then for building from Source,

7
00:00:22.175 --> 00:00:25.345
we're going to describe why we do this,

8
00:00:25.345 --> 00:00:27.550
the setup for it, and then the procedure for it.

9
00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:33.150
And then, so what is OpenEmbedded?

10
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:38.843
OpenEmbedded is the Linux system that was created for a project called the Yocto Project.

11
00:00:38.843 --> 00:00:43.440
And one of the advantages of OpenEmbedded is that it's very,

12
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.895
very easy to customize.

13
00:00:44.895 --> 00:00:48.370
When you see all the other options,

14
00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.345
you will go back to this one and see how easy it is

15
00:00:51.345 --> 00:00:55.725
to just customize your own operating system.

16
00:00:55.725 --> 00:00:59.790
And it's used primarily for cross-compilation.

17
00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:05.490
So if you're on an operating system or a certain build-up operating system,

18
00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:10.493
that might not compile on another computer,

19
00:01:10.493 --> 00:01:19.590
this one is very useful for compiling other operating system stuff on its own computer.

20
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.170
So that's what cross-compilation is.

21
00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:29.670
And then, it also works on any Linux distribution so it's very versatile in that way.

22
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.625
So reasons for building from source.

23
00:01:31.625 --> 00:01:33.555
So this is basically,

24
00:01:33.555 --> 00:01:40.310
general reasons for building from source for all the videos.

25
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.225
So one of the reasons is,

26
00:01:42.225 --> 00:01:48.630
you're able to customize the code in whatever way fits what you're doing.

27
00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:55.034
So one way is, maybe you didn't want GPU accelerated hardware support,

28
00:01:55.034 --> 00:01:58.500
this means you're doing something graphics-heavy and you don't want

29
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.485
anything else in your operating system that might not cover that.

30
00:02:02.485 --> 00:02:06.780
So doing building from source will help

31
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.090
you achieve whatever goals that you might have with your operating system.

32
00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.925
Another reason, not quite applicable reason,

33
00:02:17.925 --> 00:02:23.276
but maybe you're just really curious about how the operating system works,

34
00:02:23.276 --> 00:02:26.520
so it will give you all the source code and then you can see

35
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.785
first-hand what is happening in the OS and so forth.

36
00:02:31.785 --> 00:02:36.900
And also, we want to stress that if you're not too knowledgeable in the OS,

37
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.730
that you don't try to touch the source code at all and just use

38
00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.955
whatever simple instructions that are provided in the 96Boards websites that we provide.

39
00:02:47.955 --> 00:02:52.110
If you are knowledgeable in OS then go ahead,

40
00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:58.595
you guys can just modify the source code however you guys want.

41
00:02:58.595 --> 00:03:00.510
So for the set-up,

42
00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.484
what you want are your host machine which is your computer,

43
00:03:03.484 --> 00:03:10.860
you're going to be compiling and building the OS on.

44
00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.660
We're going to be using a Linux host machine.

45
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.990
And one way to set up a host machine let's say,

46
00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:17.790
if you're running Windows or Mac,

47
00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.530
you can run it through a Virtual Machine.

48
00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.310
But for Virtual Machine you got to make

49
00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.165
sure the DragonBoard is connected to the Virtual Machine instead of your actual computer,

50
00:03:27.165 --> 00:03:31.355
so then we can actually flash the board through fastbooting.

51
00:03:31.355 --> 00:03:33.878
And another way is just to have a Linux computer.

52
00:03:33.878 --> 00:03:37.725
You can either dual boot or just have a fully Linux computer.

53
00:03:37.725 --> 00:03:40.215
And for all the videos and in this demo,

54
00:03:40.215 --> 00:03:47.255
we'll be using Ubuntu 16.04 and on VMWare Workstation Pro.

55
00:03:47.255 --> 00:03:50.950
So here are some instructions on how to get started.

56
00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.185
So before we start,

57
00:03:53.185 --> 00:03:57.940
we want you guys to understand what fastbooting is,

58
00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.330
and how you want to transfer images

59
00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:08.135
from your computer to the DragonBoard using fastboot.

60
00:04:08.135 --> 00:04:13.655
And you usually need a USB to micro USB connection and so forth.

61
00:04:13.655 --> 00:04:18.420
And we want you to follow the steps

62
00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:23.850
provided in the 96Boards instructions that we give you for fastbooting,

63
00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.381
steps one to four,

64
00:04:25.381 --> 00:04:27.960
because five is but give you an image

65
00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.990
that's not quite the image that you build from source,

66
00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.625
it's just the default image that they provided.

67
00:04:34.625 --> 00:04:37.320
So you just want to follow steps one to four,

68
00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:42.315
and then follow the instructions for building from source that we'll provide.

69
00:04:42.315 --> 00:04:49.621
So let's go to the website to see what the instructions website says.

70
00:04:49.621 --> 00:04:56.225
So here we are in the OpenEmbedded website.

71
00:04:56.225 --> 00:04:58.200
And then if you scroll down,

72
00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:03.594
you'll see a bunch of dependencies that you might need to install.

73
00:05:03.594 --> 00:05:05.820
So let's make this bigger so you guys can see.

74
00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:09.950
Close that big thing.

75
00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:13.325
And here, you want to install git.

76
00:05:13.325 --> 00:05:17.340
We already told you to install git in previous videos.

77
00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.750
But just in case you don't have one.

78
00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:20.818
You don't have one.

79
00:05:20.818 --> 00:05:24.670
Actually you will need

80
00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:28.151
to do this because this is for your host machine not for your DragonBoard,

81
00:05:28.151 --> 00:05:31.550
so you will need to install git.

82
00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:32.581
Yeah.

83
00:05:32.581 --> 00:05:40.002
And then here's all the dependencies that you might need for your specific host machine.

84
00:05:40.002 --> 00:05:41.610
So if you go here,

85
00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:46.931
we're using Ubuntu so you might need to install these,

86
00:05:46.931 --> 00:05:50.250
that's a lot but I guess you need it.

87
00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:55.431
And then here we will need to install whiptail or dialog,

88
00:05:55.431 --> 00:05:58.190
they both do the same thing, just pick one.

89
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:03.540
And then later it

90
00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:09.620
shows you that you need to download the Bootloader and the eMMC partitions.

91
00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:13.080
But these are all part of the instructions for fastbooting,

92
00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.390
so if you just followed the instructions,

93
00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:18.300
you should be cleared on this one.

94
00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:19.710
And then if you go here,

95
00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:23.035
this is the actual instructions for building it.

96
00:06:23.035 --> 00:06:27.470
And then after this it will show you how to customize

97
00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:34.910
all your images to fit whatever role you want your operating system to fit.

98
00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:39.780
So, here we see one of the images that you can build.

99
00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:41.555
It's the console-only image.

100
00:06:41.555 --> 00:06:43.850
And the instructions are really simple,

101
00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:45.800
you just run this one command and it will

102
00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.145
customize it perfectly for whatever need you have.

103
00:06:49.145 --> 00:06:50.960
So the console-only image,

104
00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.961
you just do a bitbake,

105
00:06:52.961 --> 00:06:54.365
and then the image name,

106
00:06:54.365 --> 00:06:56.845
and then it will do it for you.

107
00:06:56.845 --> 00:07:01.760
And then the X11 image with GPU hardware accelerated support,

108
00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:03.620
this one is a little more complicated,

109
00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:05.810
but it's still like five steps.

110
00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:09.200
So after you do bitbake,

111
00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.675
you want to go to your DragonBoard,

112
00:07:11.675 --> 00:07:17.450
and you want to look at all of these and then you're done.

113
00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:21.460
So, as you can see bitbake allows you

114
00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:25.785
to just build an image without actually going into the source code.

115
00:07:25.785 --> 00:07:31.795
And you guys can find more bitbake images that are online to fit whatever roles you have.

116
00:07:31.795 --> 00:07:37.165
We've given you three examples of images that you can use through bitbake.

117
00:07:37.165 --> 00:07:42.340
But if you guys are curious on how to use bitbake more,

118
00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:46.280
then just use your favorite search engine to find out more.

119
00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:50.230
And then one more thing,

120
00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:53.530
let's just go onto our Virtual Machine to see

121
00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:57.616
how to connect the DragonBoard to the Virtual Machine.

122
00:07:57.616 --> 00:08:03.115
So for our purposes we're using the VMWare Workstation,

123
00:08:03.115 --> 00:08:05.790
so let's just power this on for a bit.

124
00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:11.600
It might take a while but let's just wait.

125
00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:27.455
So Virtual Machines are generally very slow as you can see right now.

126
00:08:27.455 --> 00:08:29.120
It's because it's trying to run

127
00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:34.884
your Virtual machine operating system and your host operating system at the same time.

128
00:08:34.884 --> 00:08:38.040
So it's not quite fast but.

129
00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:39.350
What a beautiful rush of speed.

130
00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:46.820
Let's just wait a little bit until it goes to the login screen.

131
00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:49.375
We can probably- okay.

132
00:08:49.375 --> 00:08:54.180
So here we are. So if we go into VMWare and then removable devices,

133
00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:57.024
we see that the DragonBoards not connected.

134
00:08:57.024 --> 00:09:00.495
But if we connect the micro USB to

135
00:09:00.495 --> 00:09:04.825
USB connection to our mezzanine that is connected to our DragonBoard.

136
00:09:04.825 --> 00:09:09.560
Yeah, so this is important. Connect it through the mezzanine and the DSP.

137
00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:14.615
And then if we click on this again,

138
00:09:14.615 --> 00:09:19.830
you'll see that the 96Boards console is there.

139
00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:23.278
It's very hard to see, but it's there.

140
00:09:23.278 --> 00:09:26.705
So let's just click on Connect Disconnect from Host,

141
00:09:26.705 --> 00:09:30.620
and the host meaning that we're disconnecting from

142
00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:35.175
Windows and then we're connecting to the Ubuntu operating system.

143
00:09:35.175 --> 00:09:37.895
Let's just click that and then it will show a message,

144
00:09:37.895 --> 00:09:39.470
and then we just click okay.

145
00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:44.043
And now your DragonBoard is connected to your operating system.

146
00:09:44.043 --> 00:09:49.160
So, that's all the clarification that we wanted to provide.

147
00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:53.308
If you guys need more clarifications on what steps you need to follow,

148
00:09:53.308 --> 00:09:58.460
just check out the 96Boards open hours that happen every week.

149
00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:01.903
Or you can just ask us directly through Coursera.

150
00:10:01.903 --> 00:10:06.380
So look out for more videos on building from source.

151
00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:11.120
This was our building from source for OpenEmbedded.
