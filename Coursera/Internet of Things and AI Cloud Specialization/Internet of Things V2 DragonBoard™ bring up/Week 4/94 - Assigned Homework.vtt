00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
So in this field, we're going to show you guys some homework

2
00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.280
that you guys should do for that after seeing this project.

3
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:06.870
So at this point,

4
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.090
you guys have seen the demo of the projects,

5
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.185
Home Surveillance Projects seeing it in action taking a picture of us recognizing it,

6
00:00:13.185 --> 00:00:15.670
and then, it being spit on a simple Website.

7
00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.810
And even walk through and understood partially some of the code.

8
00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.610
That code walk through a little brisk.

9
00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:29.205
So, we want you to go through the actual tutorial that where this project is from.

10
00:00:29.205 --> 00:00:34.935
It's five parts made by what is ISO six for product developers,

11
00:00:34.935 --> 00:00:36.635
and just go through it.

12
00:00:36.635 --> 00:00:39.410
Run the project follow the instructions.

13
00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.195
After that, we want you to also visit the get help for this project,

14
00:00:43.195 --> 00:00:46.940
and just look through the code try to understand how it works.

15
00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.825
That can have also includes some of the instructions that the tutorial also has.

16
00:00:51.825 --> 00:00:55.690
So, next thing we want you guys to do is familiarize

17
00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.190
yourself with OpenCV on this topic that will show up later as well,

18
00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:06.420
but just read up on some of documentation to get familiar with just this part of it.

19
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.370
And we also want you to get familiar with the facial recognition part of OpenCV as well,

20
00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:16.015
just go to the API documentation and just read up on the methods,

21
00:01:16.015 --> 00:01:23.135
and we want you to do the same thing as well with AWS-S3 Python API.

22
00:01:23.135 --> 00:01:26.995
This should give you a deep understanding of the code.

23
00:01:26.995 --> 00:01:30.945
Yeah. So, be sure to read up on them.

24
00:01:30.945 --> 00:01:35.040
A good way to learn is just doing some examples that they provide.

25
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.050
Yep. Be sure to again,

26
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.210
be sure to read up on all the resources,

27
00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.268
they may or may not be tested on,

28
00:01:41.268 --> 00:01:43.000
so look out for that.
