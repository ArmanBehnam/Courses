1
00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:06.520
So, here we're continuing our series on building from source.

2
00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:12.605
And our next video is on Debian and lets get on with it.

3
00:00:12.605 --> 00:00:15.520
Just a brief overview of what we are going to do.

4
00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.780
We are going to do a description of Debian and then after that we are going to do,

5
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:24.920
building from source and just the procedure for it. Yeah, off to description.

6
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.440
So what exactly is Debian?

7
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.235
So Debian is an operating system that's built from free software,

8
00:00:32.235 --> 00:00:36.375
and the software is licensed under GNU.

9
00:00:36.375 --> 00:00:41.320
And as you guys might have already known Ubuntu

10
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.860
is Debian based and it's one of the most popular Linux operating systems out there.

11
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.675
A lot of Linux computers,

12
00:00:49.675 --> 00:00:53.487
virtual machines/dual boot use Ubuntu.

13
00:00:53.487 --> 00:00:58.065
So Debian is very, very widespread.

14
00:00:58.065 --> 00:01:01.600
And another advantage to Debian is that,

15
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.950
it has a really easy way of updating your software.

16
00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.280
So, the apt command that we might have mentioned

17
00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.660
earlier is just a single line command that you can type into your computer,

18
00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.010
and it just installs,

19
00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:21.775
updates software that you need in your operating system.

20
00:01:21.775 --> 00:01:27.075
And this is also our choice for most of Coursera.

21
00:01:27.075 --> 00:01:28.810
We're going to focus on Debian,

22
00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.900
Android, and Open Embedded,

23
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.815
not quite so much.

24
00:01:33.815 --> 00:01:37.690
But if you really are wondering

25
00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.280
what operating system that we're going to use and like things about it,

26
00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.215
then this is a really good option.

27
00:01:46.215 --> 00:01:49.420
And then let's get to the next slide.

28
00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.480
Yeah. So here are the actual steps I started.

29
00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:59.690
But first familiarize yourself with fastboot.

30
00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.100
The instructions have been mentioned in previous videos.

31
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.500
We're going to restate them here.

32
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.317
So we want to connect the DragonBoard to the host computer,

33
00:02:07.317 --> 00:02:09.094
through the micro USB and USB cable.

34
00:02:09.094 --> 00:02:13.855
Then set up fastboot mode on the DragonBoard

35
00:02:13.855 --> 00:02:19.570
and then follow the instructions on the 96 board instruction website.

36
00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.625
And they'll be read in the readings.

37
00:02:21.625 --> 00:02:23.800
And important things to note is that you want to

38
00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.110
make sure you have space on your host computer because,

39
00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.860
Debian itself is very, very large.

40
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.540
So you want to have enough hard drive space,

41
00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.970
or just space to store that huge OS.

42
00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:41.530
Next thing you want is to patch your GCC cross compiler.

43
00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.275
And it is a directory's bin folder.

44
00:02:45.275 --> 00:02:47.920
And if necessary we need to transfer

45
00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.365
the module files to lib modules folder of the DragonBoard 410c.

46
00:02:51.365 --> 00:02:55.945
Set off to a little bit more.

47
00:02:55.945 --> 00:02:58.874
Yeah.

48
00:02:58.874 --> 00:03:01.450
So here we are at the website,

49
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.370
and this is a very lengthy website that we've provided for you.

50
00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.580
So, we're just going to go over which parts that you need to look at.

51
00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:17.395
So in order to customize your kernel source code,

52
00:03:17.395 --> 00:03:21.440
kernel meaning your operating system.

53
00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.455
This is the place you want to see,

54
00:03:23.455 --> 00:03:25.715
so you want to follow all these steps.

55
00:03:25.715 --> 00:03:29.500
And if you want to customize one way of customizing is,

56
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:35.225
just changing these three tags over here. Sorry let me.

57
00:03:35.225 --> 00:03:39.875
Oh where my mouse cursor is I can't highlight it for some reason.

58
00:03:39.875 --> 00:03:42.670
So, you want to look into that.

59
00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.145
And this is just an easy way of doing it.

60
00:03:46.145 --> 00:03:50.590
Another way of doing it is just get cloning the source code,

61
00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.755
and changing your directory to it,

62
00:03:53.755 --> 00:03:57.610
and you have access to all this source code you need,

63
00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:59.320
in order to modify it.

64
00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:06.820
And then you check out and change to whatever version of Debian you're going to download.

65
00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.000
And this one we're using 17.09,

66
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.685
which is the latest one.

67
00:04:11.685 --> 00:04:21.425
So, and then we can't see that in here it tells you to export cross compile to your path.

68
00:04:21.425 --> 00:04:25.145
And we're going to show you what this path actually means.

69
00:04:25.145 --> 00:04:27.640
As we mentioned in the slides.

70
00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.615
So if we go over here.

71
00:04:29.615 --> 00:04:32.222
Let me clear this real quick.

72
00:04:32.222 --> 00:04:36.130
And then when we downloaded the GCC compiler,

73
00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.575
we put it in our downloads folder. So let's go in there.

74
00:04:39.575 --> 00:04:47.360
And then let's go to our GCC Linaro and then if we go back to the website,

75
00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:55.890
it will tell you that is looking for aarch64-linux-gnu.

76
00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:03.438
But if you go back here in ls it's not there right.

77
00:05:03.438 --> 00:05:05.480
So, we want you to,

78
00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:10.854
put in the past an extra backslash bin.

79
00:05:10.854 --> 00:05:15.895
And if you ls here you'll see that all the GNU files,

80
00:05:15.895 --> 00:05:17.690
GNU programs are there.

81
00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:23.090
So, this is just a clarification on the instructions that might confuse some people,

82
00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:26.845
so we just wanted to clarify that.

83
00:05:26.845 --> 00:05:32.025
Oh my bad. As you scroll down and then,

84
00:05:32.025 --> 00:05:36.190
this is the part for just compiling the software.

85
00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:42.245
And as you can see it tells you to move the modules to your lib modules folder,

86
00:05:42.245 --> 00:05:46.095
and the modules are basically like additional stuff like

87
00:05:46.095 --> 00:05:51.155
some support for video for Linux two.

88
00:05:51.155 --> 00:05:57.335
Video for Linux two is also supported by the modules that you install here.

89
00:05:57.335 --> 00:06:00.470
So, these are some cool things

90
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:05.197
that you guys can just use to customize your operating system.

91
00:06:05.197 --> 00:06:09.590
And then afterwards it tells you how to build the boot image.

92
00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:14.150
And this is creating the image itself that you're going to use fastboot on.

93
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:15.875
And if you scroll down,

94
00:06:15.875 --> 00:06:19.279
it tells you how to do the fastboot.

95
00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:22.015
So, if you just cover steps 1 to 4 of

96
00:06:22.015 --> 00:06:24.915
the fastboot instructions and then run this right after,

97
00:06:24.915 --> 00:06:27.920
you should have the image on your DragonBoard.

98
00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.980
And then if you want to know,

99
00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:34.685
so Debian also gives you an option to work directly from

100
00:06:34.685 --> 00:06:38.775
the DragonBoard and customize the source code on the DragonBoard.

101
00:06:38.775 --> 00:06:41.440
And these are the instructions on that.

102
00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:44.720
So, for this you don't really need a host machine,

103
00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.750
you can just do it on the DragonBoard and then yeah.

104
00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:56.874
So, for that you want to go to how to get a customized Debian packages source code.

105
00:06:56.874 --> 00:07:00.725
Now that's all the instructions that you'll need to look at.

106
00:07:00.725 --> 00:07:03.290
And if you guys need any help,

107
00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:07.370
just check out the open hours as we mentioned in previous videos,

108
00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:09.330
or just ask us directly.

109
00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:10.000
Yeah.
