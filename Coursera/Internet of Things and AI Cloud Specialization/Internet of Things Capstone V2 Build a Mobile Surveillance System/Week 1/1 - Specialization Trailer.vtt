00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:01.507
Hello all.

2
00:00:01.507 --> 00:00:06.055
Welcome to the specialization
on the Internet of Things.

3
00:00:06.055 --> 00:00:15.100
The Internet of Things overview point is
the convergence of multiple technologies.

4
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.560
We will talk about telephone network,
circuit switch and

5
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:24.190
a lot of innovations give rise to
broadcast radio and television.

6
00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:30.060
And that, in turn led to consumer
electronics and the growth of content.

7
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:39.090
Around this time, 1972, DARPA commissioned
the development of Internet to do

8
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.930
one thing that could not be done
with the telephone networks and

9
00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.110
the broadcast networks at that time,
that is reliability.

10
00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.240
And as we all know,
Internet delivered on reliability and

11
00:00:53.240 --> 00:01:00.520
went on to subsume the functionality of
telephone networks and broadcast networks.

12
00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:08.370
So the next big converging technology
was wireless technologies,

13
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.300
and that gave us wireless Internet and
the smartphones.

14
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:18.190
And in this course, we are going
to use the smartphone platform

15
00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:24.570
to teach you the Internet of Things and
what the future might be.

16
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.710
The IOT platform, the indications are,
it will give us new products and

17
00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:36.270
services in the space of automotive
industry, healthcare, robotics.

18
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.530
The unique thing about this course,

19
00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:44.650
this series of courses is completely
hands on and lab oriented.

20
00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:50.690
And I would like to come and
introduce the lab parts about that.

21
00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:51.766
Hello come on in.

22
00:01:51.766 --> 00:01:53.618
>> Hey thanks.

23
00:01:53.618 --> 00:01:56.830
Hey guys, you probably all are looking to
take this course because you're interested

24
00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.748
to build on Internet of Things And
I think you've come to the right place.

25
00:02:00.748 --> 00:02:04.780
This is going to be really hands on
most of the courses here are built by

26
00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:05.998
the students of UCSD.

27
00:02:05.998 --> 00:02:10.206
You're going to be working with
this aero electronics dragon

28
00:02:10.206 --> 00:02:14.580
board potency which runs at
falcon snap dragon processor.

29
00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.962
This is a kind of you can think of it
like if you take out this smart phone

30
00:02:17.962 --> 00:02:19.040
open up the hood.

31
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.740
What you'd find is components in here, so
this will form the core of the course.

32
00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.780
To follow along you would buy one
of these, it's not a big deal,

33
00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.400
it's not that expensive.

34
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.180
But, I want to pause here and kind of give
you a snap shot of what you're going to

35
00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.532
experience throughout this course.

36
00:02:34.532 --> 00:02:38.300
You're going to see some of the lab
projects you'll be building.

37
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.690
And after that, you finally end up
with a Capstone project where you'll

38
00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.660
create your own ideas and
build on it using the.

39
00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.578
Anyway, leave now to give a little trailer
of what you'll experience in the course

40
00:02:50.578 --> 00:02:52.557
and hope to see you in course one.

41
00:02:52.557 --> 00:03:02.557
[MUSIC]

42
00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:24.775
Hey guys, want to introduce you to the
rest of the team, made the move possible.

43
00:03:24.775 --> 00:03:28.020
Want to start with Robert here but
before that I wanted to say this,

44
00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.205
two students are missing here, Randy and

45
00:03:30.205 --> 00:03:32.370
Eukridge,but you'll get to see
them later throughout the course.

46
00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.960
I'll start with the chief
of students Robert.

47
00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:35.870
>> Thanks.

48
00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.070
I'm Robert Wolf.

49
00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.000
I just recently graduated here at
UCSD with electrical engineering and

50
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.370
I look forward to meeting everyone
throughout these courses coming up.

51
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:44.180
>> I'm Eric Urel.

52
00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.510
I'm a grad student in the EC
department here at UCSD and

53
00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.130
I'm here to teach you guys some Parkour.

54
00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.800
Just kidding.
[LAUGH] We're here for Electrical.

55
00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.070
>> My name's Jacob Torrado.

56
00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.820
I'm a third year here studying
computer science at UCSD.

57
00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.109
And I'm ready for the course.

58
00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:05.740
>> And I'm I'm also third year at
UCAD doing computer engineering.

59
00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:09.710
And I'm going to have a great time
doing these courses with you guys.

60
00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:10.230
>> And finally,

61
00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.600
