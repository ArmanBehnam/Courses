00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:01.690
Hello everyone and

2
00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:05.348
welcome back to the Internet of
Things Specialization here at UCSD.

3
00:00:05.348 --> 00:00:10.320
I'd like to start off by welcoming you and

4
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.920
congratulating you on making it to
the Capstone part of this specialization.

5
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.030
So yeah.

6
00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:20.700
In this project or in this last
course of this specialization,

7
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.650
we are going to actually make
something very exciting.

8
00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.800
And in fact,
you can either follow along or

9
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.230
take our tips on what we will be
making ourselves and showing you,

10
00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.940
along with some other examples, or
you can just take our ideas and

11
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.380
we'll kind of brainstorm a little bit and
you can make something else also.

12
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.870
As long as it follows
the criteria that we're asking.

13
00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.580
But yeah, so we are going to make
a self-sustainable work station for

14
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.670
your Dragonboard 410c and
it will be geared towards, hopefully,

15
00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.390
a surveillance system of your own.

16
00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.880
Now, what we will talk about in this
part one of the Capstone course.

17
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.316
So we're going to first
start off with the approach.

18
00:01:03.316 --> 00:01:08.600
Now, the approach is basically
the steps that we went through at least

19
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:14.100
the process that we went through
while wanting to build our system.

20
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.980
So when you're building a self-sustainable
system, you have to think, okay,

21
00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.200
I need power, right?

22
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.080
I need to power all these electronics.

23
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.490
And we chose solar power.

24
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.290
It's everywhere, right?

25
00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.280
So how do we build the solar power system?

26
00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.430
What parts do we need?

27
00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.440
And how will we calculate
the needs of our system?

28
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.790
So we're going to talk
about that a little bit.

29
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.180
Then we're going to talk
about the components and

30
00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.170
how we chose the components based
on the approach that we took

31
00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.250
when we wanted to build the system.

32
00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.100
After that, we're going to go
a little bit into the parts,

33
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:53.300
we're actually going to use for the system
itself but I also wanted to show

34
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:59.480
you some other projects, some other
things that we have done here at UCSD

35
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:04.722
with solar powered systems and
self-sustainable work stations.

36
00:02:04.722 --> 00:02:07.142
So it's really exciting,
we have a bunch of photos that we took.

37
00:02:07.142 --> 00:02:11.860
We hopefully will be able to walk
you through this whole process,

38
00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.300
this is just a kind of fun lesson for

39
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.010
you and hopefully you can kind of see
how we went through this whole process,

40
00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.440
and in later parts of this course,
we will be building it for you.

41
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.330
So I look forward seeing
you in the later videos.
