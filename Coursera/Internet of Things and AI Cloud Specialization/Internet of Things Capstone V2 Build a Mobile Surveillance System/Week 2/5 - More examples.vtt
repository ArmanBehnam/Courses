1
00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:01.640
Welcome back everyone.

2
00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:05.240
Now before we dive into the whole

3
00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.140
prototype that we want to show you
taking all of our components and

4
00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.230
putting it in the box,
getting it all set up to show you.

5
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.110
I wanted to kind of walk you through
another example something that myself and

6
00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.120
a bunch of students built here at UCSD

7
00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.030
not too long ago I think about maybe
about a year, a little over a year ago.

8
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:24.790
The system is very similar to the one
that we're going to be showing you

9
00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:26.060
except a lot bigger.

10
00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.940
Now we wanted the system to power for
a lot more things.

11
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.060
It's going to be a shipping container.

12
00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.200
It's going to be providing
a stem education to kids.

13
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.710
Then we want to learn about DC power.

14
00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:37.930
We want to learn about AC power.

15
00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.800
We want to power fans,
possibly an air conditioner.

16
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.227
We want to make sure that there's
lighting for the whole area outside, so

17
00:00:45.227 --> 00:00:47.632
the system had to be built a lot bigger.

18
00:00:47.632 --> 00:00:51.972
Anyways, right here, we walked through
the whole process that we went through

19
00:00:51.972 --> 00:00:56.505
earlier, the diagram, how many panels we
needed, how many batteries we needed,

20
00:00:56.505 --> 00:00:59.777
what kind of charge controller,
inverter, everything.

21
00:00:59.777 --> 00:01:03.310
And we kind of came up with
this design to meet that.

22
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.890
So you can see, kind of match the numbers
there, the inverter, you have it there,

23
00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:08.691
a little gray box.

24
00:01:08.691 --> 00:01:10.520
Our charge controller.

25
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.243
The battery packs,
which are on the bottom.

26
00:01:13.243 --> 00:01:16.171
And then we wanted to do DC as well,
so we have a 12 volt regulator and

27
00:01:16.171 --> 00:01:17.089
a 5 volt regulator.

28
00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.106
Another view of that is
going to be right there.

29
00:01:21.106 --> 00:01:24.970
Seeing as though it's a workstation,
kind of a semi mobile work station.

30
00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.810
We wanted to provide a place to work on.

31
00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.180
Right?
So you have a drywall,

32
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.220
it's kind of like a mock wall right?

33
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.880
Dry wall you have your little workbench,
computer station.

34
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.980
And then we wanted to have our AC
wall sockets on the bottom, and

35
00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.500
our DC wall sockets on the top.

36
00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.140
This is still a process that you all
at home should work through as well.

37
00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.130
Deciding on how you want to
build your station.

38
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.098
Another little example from the bottom.

39
00:01:51.098 --> 00:01:55.720
And then comes the ultimate goal,

40
00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.880
which was to place it inside
of a shipping container.

41
00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.840
With plenty of access for students or
whoever would like to use this system.

42
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.310
The panels would be either mounted on top,
kept inside the shipping container for

43
00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.120
safe storage, and then pulled out
when they need to be used etc., etc.

44
00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.310
The rest is up to your imagination right?

45
00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.020
So we actually did this.

46
00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.910
There's the shipping container.

47
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.310
It's an 8' x 8' x 20' shipping container.

48
00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.590
And we'll go into a little
bit of the building process.

49
00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.850
Now again you can skip
this video if you like.

50
00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.310
I just wanted to kind of show
you something that we made.

51
00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.048
Hopefully it can spark
some ideas into your head,

52
00:02:34.048 --> 00:02:38.352
because maybe you don't want a rolling
mobile surveillance system capable of

53
00:02:38.352 --> 00:02:40.387
powering the dragon board 410 C.

54
00:02:40.387 --> 00:02:42.970
Maybe you want something bigger,
maybe you want something for your house.

55
00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.832
Maybe you want something for
your shed outside,

56
00:02:46.832 --> 00:02:50.230
something bigger, so this is a good idea.

57
00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:51.780
All right, so here we go.

58
00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.530
This is kind of us working on it.

59
00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.600
I said measure twice cut once.

60
00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.340
We first decided to
mount the solar panels.

61
00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.760
We have these huge Kia-Sarah solar panels,

62
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.060
I think they were capable
of over 200 watts each.

63
00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.480
The top of the line now pushes I think
300 watts on these big solar panels.

64
00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.690
But again, go back 10 years ago,
20 years ago, these things were enormous,

65
00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:13.820
huge, heavy.

66
00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.760
We're very lucky to have
solar panels like this now.

67
00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:18.570
So we mounted them.

68
00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.940
We decided to go with four solar panels,
2 per structure.

69
00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.650
Our system was designed to handle,
I think, 100 solar panels or

70
00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:26.330
something like that.

71
00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.890
So it's still capable for
plenty of expansion,

72
00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.180
something to keep in mind also when
you're designing your capstone project,

73
00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.420
maybe you want to get a big charge
controller, a big inverter,

74
00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:41.400
a bunch of batteries but maybe you only
want to use two solar panels right now.

75
00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.000
You have plenty of time to charge it and
you want plenty of time to use it as well.

76
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.540
So leaving that open for expansion, you
could carry this system around with you.

77
00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.840
Use it for a long time, bring it home,
hook it up to a bunch of solar panels so

78
00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.810
that it charges really fast,
and then go out again.

79
00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.480
Right?
So again, a lot of variables.

80
00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.140
We built our battery bank,
as you can see, we used four batteries.

81
00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.590
Four 12 volt batteries which
makes it 48 volts in series.

82
00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:06.710
We did put it in series.

83
00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.990
And we wanted the battery bank
to be detachable, you know?

84
00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:16.700
So that you could move the batteries by
themselves, and you could move the system

85
00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.620
by itself and then put the batteries back,
or replace the batteries easily.

86
00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.010
Also, for ventilation purposes.

87
00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.350
So you can see it's starting
to come together here.

88
00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:26.400
This was the mock wall.

89
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.459
You saw the 3D image.

90
00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.990
This didn't take a lot of time.

91
00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:32.070
If you have yourself and

92
00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.990
a couple buddies, it'd be really cool
to see what you can come up with.

93
00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.370
This is us kind of drilling
some cabling holes so

94
00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.370
that everything can be maintained,
a little organized.

95
00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.960
As you can see, Eric, I don't know if
you remember him from course 2 and 3.

96
00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.220
There he is mounting up the router.

97
00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.650
We have our charge controller up there,
the inverter.

98
00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.550
And things are starting to come together.

99
00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:00.270
Here is kind of the final product,
I guess you could say, from the back end.

100
00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.010
So from left to right, they're both
the same pictures just zoomed in,

101
00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:06.070
the left side you have your inverter.

102
00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:07.760
Right in the middle is
the charge controller,

103
00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.730
kind of the top right next to the charge
controller on the right that's a router,

104
00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:17.610
below we have a breaker incase something
happens it cuts the current so

105
00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:24.280
that nothing blows up, and
then we have the two DC parts.

106
00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.983
The 5 volt regulator and
the 12 volt regulator.

107
00:05:26.983 --> 00:05:27.830
All right.

108
00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:32.556
So it's starting to come together and we
bring it out to our shipping container and

109
00:05:32.556 --> 00:05:36.150
we setup our solar panels and
it's good to go, right?

110
00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:39.880
So, that's just an example for you, right?

111
00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.109
I wanted to show you something exciting,

112
00:05:42.109 --> 00:05:45.431
something that any one of you
are capable of doing on your own.

113
00:05:45.431 --> 00:05:50.345
And just to let you know this system
in particular is very capable

114
00:05:50.345 --> 00:05:54.713
of doing almost anything that
you could probably need for

115
00:05:54.713 --> 00:06:00.110
your house except obviously we
didn't completely geared it out.

116
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:05.700
But the charge controller, the inverter,
all of that very high end stuff

117
00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:10.680
I think all in all,
this whole project costed us about $3,500.

118
00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:14.910
But as you can tell, it'll probably save
a lot of money in the long run on energy

119
00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:20.780
bills or anything that might be
paying in that, I'm saying there.

120
00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:21.490
But yeah.

121
00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.450
So, what kind of stuff are you capable of?

122
00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:30.820
Are capable of doing at least on the
surveillance end with a system like this.

123
00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:33.550
Or even a system that we're going to
be building in the next module.

124
00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:35.050
What kind of stuff have you used, or

125
00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:40.850
what kind of stuff would you want to learn
about or integrate into your system?

126
00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:47.270
So here we have some lecture components,

127
00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:49.880
sensors, some you have seen,
some may have not.

128
00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:54.920
Now, how could we use this for
our surveillance system?

129
00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:58.230
How could we them for our solar system?

130
00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:02.300
Now you know the stepper motor
we've made programs for it.

131
00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:04.780
We done it on Python using Linux.

132
00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:08.040
An example what could we
use the stepper motor for?

133
00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:11.650
Well stepper motor can be used
to rotate the solar panels.

134
00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:13.800
Say you don't want your solar
panels attached to your box.

135
00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.560
Say you want them detachable and
you want to carry your box around and

136
00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.650
then come back and
charge it at a charging station.

137
00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:23.530
Well you could program the solar panels to
rotate based on the timezone you're in or

138
00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:25.500
whatever, to follow the sun.

139
00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:27.880
Just an example.

140
00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:29.800
You can think of anything else.

141
00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:33.130
You could also get a light sensor and
have it follow the sun.

142
00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:37.650
And I know that there are a lot of
really cool sensors coming out.

143
00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:40.580
And we hope to integrate
these into a future course.

144
00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:41.380
We'll see.

145
00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:45.590
But I2C sensors that we will
hopefully be looking at at one point.

146
00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:50.032
Stepper motor, you have the IR sensors.

147
00:07:50.032 --> 00:07:51.517
You can break the IR sensors.

148
00:07:51.517 --> 00:07:54.338
You could send signals from
the IR transmitter/receiver.

149
00:07:54.338 --> 00:08:00.780
You have the RF identification
key fobs there.

150
00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:07.540
I mean, get close with the RF signal.

151
00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:12.330
Have the stepper motor trigger and
open your box.

152
00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:15.730
The passive infrared sensor,

153
00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:21.070
there's obviously infinite possibilities,
and these aren't even all the sensors.

154
00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:21.890
There's so many more.

155
00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:23.750
I mean,
there's hundreds of sensors out there.

156
00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:27.357
So I just wanted to talk to
a little bit about that, we will be

157
00:08:27.357 --> 00:08:32.660
talking more about the sensors that we
will be using for our project in part II.

158
00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:37.450
But I would recommend you all
keep an open mind and before

159
00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:42.440
moving on to part II, start thinking about
what you want to use for your project.

160
00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:44.190
I know you will have your list.

161
00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:47.230
After this, be sure, we'll have
the conclusion summary as always,

162
00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:49.410
but be sure you look at our list.

163
00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:52.680
Be sure you check to see if any of the
components are available in your area, and

164
00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:58.180
then start thinking about how you want to
