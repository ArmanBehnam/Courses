00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:05.930
As always here we are once
again covering what we saw

2
00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.640
in this particular part of the capstone.

3
00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:10.810
Right, so lets talk about it.

4
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.310
We went over the approach that we took for
building our system, or

5
00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:20.960
getting our system set up
basically deciding on what

6
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.680
we want our system to power,
in general the load I guess you could say.

7
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.520
We went over how we chose our components.

8
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.900
The purchasing process not so much but

9
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.579
I mean, I'm pretty sure most of you have
gone through buying electrical components.

10
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.290
Find the best spot, find the best price,
match your specification,

11
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.290
all part of the approach in
building your capstone project.

12
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.570
We talked about
the components that we use.

13
00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.330
Now in general, these components
should be available to you.

14
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:59.640
I hope they're available to you, but if
not, just use the links that we'll provide

15
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:06.040
you, use the specifications that
we have or just use the ideas and

16
00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.260
the concepts that we're providing
you to pick out your own components.

17
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.140
And if you have any questions, go to the
forums, go to the discussion boards and

18
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.010
talk with your fellow students.

19
00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.000
Talk with us and hopefully we can help you
pick out the components that you want for

20
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.340
your system.

21
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.690
Before jumping on to part two of this
course, I'd suggest spending as much time

22
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.326
as possible figuring out what you
want your project to be in general.

23
00:01:35.326 --> 00:01:41.380
A self-sustainable surveillance system but
maybe you want to focus more on video.

24
00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.050
Maybe you want to focus more on VOIP.

25
00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.430
Maybe you want to focus more on
just general sensing and acuation.

26
00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:55.410
Send something and
trigger a motor to do something.

27
00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.900
Use the bluetooth to network
capabilities of the DragonBoard 410C,

28
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:00.909
whatever you want to use.

29
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.360
Set that aside and focus on that and
then move on to part two.

30
00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.790
We do look forward to seeing you there and

31
00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:12.810
again don't forget to check the links,
the links after this.

32
00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:18.480
And we will see you in the next part where
we get to kind of show you our device and

33
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.840
hopefully you like and get some good
ideas for something of your own.
