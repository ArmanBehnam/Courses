00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:01.900
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:06.740
It's time now to talk to you about
the components that we will be using for

3
00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:13.480
this particular system we plan on building
in part two or later on in this course.

4
00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.020
Here we go.
Now I just want to remind you that

5
00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.580
these components that
we're going to show you,

6
00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.880
we're just showing you kind of an over
all characteristic of the components.

7
00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.470
You will be able to find
links to all of these stuff

8
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.520
that they we're going to show
you later on after the videos.

9
00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.900
But please remember that you can
always go out and search for

10
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.800
components or devices with
these similar characteristics.

11
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.120
Now you might not find that exact
solar panel is available to you,

12
00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.370
maybe a better version is available for
you and even cheaper, you never know.

13
00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.750
By the time you're building your
system you just never know.

14
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.340
Also if you want to build something
more powerful, do that too.

15
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:50.520
So here we go, let's dive in here.

16
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.060
Now you can see here,

17
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.550
we're going to kind of follow the path
that we did in the chart earlier right?

18
00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.520
So we started with the solar panels.

19
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.060
Here's the solar panels
that we chose to use.

20
00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.850
In general we were
restricted not only by what

21
00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.990
we wanted to power the load of
our system but also size, right?

22
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.160
We wanted to make our system
portable enough to roll around.

23
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.380
And we'll talk about
the case we use later but

24
00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.390
these panels were chosen because we
wanted them to fit on the case and

25
00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.490
we also wanted them to fit in our case for
transporting reasons.

26
00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.823
Now these panels, Eco-Worthy Solar Panels,

27
00:01:27.823 --> 00:01:31.090
you can see some other characteristics
there, Power 10 Watts,

28
00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.721
open circuit voltage,
that's what the OC stands for, 20.6 Volts.

29
00:01:34.721 --> 00:01:38.530
Short circuit current which is 0.69.

30
00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:44.600
Now, if we wanted to for example, put
two of these panels in parallel, right.

31
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.930
Well we would be adding two
of the currents, right.

32
00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.870
So then if we put one alone then we would

33
00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.880
have 0.69 amps provided to our
charge controller which comes next.

34
00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.485
But if we put 2 in parallel you
could see there ISC Total, so

35
00:01:59.485 --> 00:02:02.313
I short circuit total would be 1.38 Amps.

36
00:02:02.313 --> 00:02:03.983
You would add them because
they're in parallel.

37
00:02:03.983 --> 00:02:08.034
Same can be said if we added
the voltage in series,

38
00:02:08.034 --> 00:02:12.664
so we put two of these panels in series,
then open circuit

39
00:02:12.664 --> 00:02:17.498
voltage would add and
we would end up with 21 or 41.2.

40
00:02:17.498 --> 00:02:22.120
So, 41.2 Volts, open circuit voltage.

41
00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.200
All the rules have circuit
analysis supply to this as well.

42
00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.570
Now, we wanted to pair this or
at least stay within the boundary of our

43
00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.240
Charge Controller,
the brain of the system.

44
00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.480
And, the panels feeding to
the Charge Controller and

45
00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.620
look what the Charge Controller
is capable of.

46
00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.500
So, Charge Controller is capable of

47
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.870
a open circuit voltage of
a max of 40 volts, right?

48
00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.910
So that being said, we almost couldn't
put these two panels and pair in series.

49
00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:50.420
Sorry.

50
00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.090
because if we put them in series we'll
be pushing that threshold very close.

51
00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.230
Now, the charge controller is
capable of 30 amps short circuit.

52
00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.420
So, we are way under the limit
on the short circuit current.

53
00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.560
That means that if we wanted to,
we could put a bunch more of these

54
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.410
panels in parallel and
beef up that amperage.

55
00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.960
All right.
Cool.

56
00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:19.820
So that's kind of some of the
characteristics of this charge controller.

57
00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:25.680
We wanted it mainly because
it had the built in display.

58
00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.300
You can find I think one was like $32 or
something around there.

59
00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.660
You can find a lot cheaper
charge controllers with

60
00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.250
right around the same characteristics for
$10, $9.

61
00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.600
And then you can buy a little
separate digital voltage display or

62
00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.880
current display, and
you can make your system that way as well.

63
00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:46.640
All right.
So

64
00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.240
next one, next component,
we have the battery and the inverter.

65
00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.070
Now, on the right side,
you see the battery?

66
00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.440
This was tricky to choose.

67
00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.420
And in fact, we reached a lot of problems
because the batteries in general,

68
00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.370
you want more amp hours right and
you want to still keep it at 12 volts.

69
00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:09.000
So, the amp hours allow you to run
the system for a longer period of time.

70
00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.810
But the more amp hours,
the bigger the battery,

71
00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.090
the heavier the dimensions get out
of control and you can no longer

72
00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.290
use a smaller case anymore especially
if you want to store your panels.

73
00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.910
You want to keep that in mind
when choosing your battery.

74
00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.090
You might not need your system to be
powered for that long so maybe you could

75
00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.900
choose less amp hours, keep your voltage
at 12 and choose less amp hours.

76
00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.910
The possibilities are endless on your end.

77
00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:42.720
We chose to use this one and we went
with just a little bit of a bigger case,

78
00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.840
a rolling case that you'll see later.

79
00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.930
After the charge controller
feeds into the batteries,

80
00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:53.830
you have the inverter that then boosts up
your voltage and allows you to use many

81
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:58.140
of your household items that you might
want to take with you with the system.

82
00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:04.360
So, our inverter right there is
Smart &Cool Inverter, 12 volts DC

83
00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:10.160
and the output is 110 volts AC.

84
00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:15.773
So there, you can see that

85
00:05:15.773 --> 00:05:24.300
this inverter 350 watts, is capable of

86
00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.740
I would say almost anything you would
want in your little portable system.

87
00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.080
I don't think, unless you want to power
a microwave or an air conditioner or

88
00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.100
something, you're not going to
get that out of this inverter.

89
00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:37.416
Either you're going to system,
you're going to need more batteries,

90
00:05:37.416 --> 00:05:39.138
you're going to need so much more stuff.

91
00:05:39.138 --> 00:05:42.357
So you're just keeping to your mobile
surveillance dragging board 410C

92
00:05:42.357 --> 00:05:43.490
work station.

93
00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:44.700
I think 350 watts should be enough.

94
00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.641
You can probably get 400, maybe 500,

95
00:05:46.641 --> 00:05:48.590
that'll allow you to do
a little more stuff.

96
00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.660
But then you're going to want to
bring a bigger battery so

97
00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:51.990
that you can power the stuff longer.

98
00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:53.240
It's all up to you.

99
00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.440
Again, so many variables for
you to have fun with.

100
00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:01.250
So now that we've chosen all those
main core components where are we

101
00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:02.120
going to put the stuff?

102
00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.900
Right here.
Well this is what we picked out.

103
00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:07.250
So a DeWalt rolling tool case.

104
00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:12.395
You can see kind of like an example
of the size that it is up there.

105
00:06:12.395 --> 00:06:16.555
We stepped up the size we originally
wanted to carry it around with us.

106
00:06:16.555 --> 00:06:20.805
But instead decided to make it a rolling
case because, again I've told you,

107
00:06:20.805 --> 00:06:23.780
the batteries and the panels, we wanted
everything to be stored in there.

108
00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:28.560
[COUGH] Essentially what we're going to do
is we're going to mount the panels on top

109
00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:29.680
of the case.

110
00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:34.210
All of the circuitry will be in
the bottom end of the case or

111
00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:35.520
the bottom part of the case.

112
00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:40.190
And then you'll have a layer on top for
your workstation.

113
00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:44.600
And the open up, the side that opens up,
you'll have a monitor

114
00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:49.500
in a way to monitor also
the charge of your station.

115
00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:54.130
So you'll have access to your charge
controller which is essentially the core

116
00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:57.910
component that you read off,
how your system is doing, but

117
00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:04.270
you will also have access to
a small screen that the DragonBoard

118
00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:08.800
we'll be using in order for you to kind
of work on your DragonBoard, of course.

119
00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:13.730
Sensors and cameras and
all of that other cool surveillance stuff.

120
00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:16.040
Well, we're going to try doing as
much as possible with that, but

121
00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:21.010
we are also going to leave all
the choices that you might be

122
00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:24.380
able to kind of switch this around and
make it even cooler up to you.

123
00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:27.560
So we will provide some examples but
in the end,

124
00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:32.301
the mobile surveillance system
is your own brainchild.

125
00:07:32.301 --> 00:07:34.220
[LAUGH] So go wild,

126
00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:38.800
do what you can with that and I'm pretty
sure we'll see a lot of really cool stuff.

127
00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:40.440
Talking a little more about this case,

128
00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:43.250
I just want to make sure that you kind of
get an ideas to why we chose this.

129
00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:46.630
The dimensions as you can see up there.

130
00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:47.640
I'm sorry it's in inches.

131
00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:50.620
I know the rest of the world
is in the metric system,

132
00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:53.240
but we're still in inches over here.

133
00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:56.820
So conversion,
one inch is 2.54 centimeters.

134
00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:58.190
You can kind of do the math there.

135
00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:01.950
We wanted weatherproof.

136
00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:04.300
So as you can see it's water resistance.

137
00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:08.280
It's capable of, in the bottom right,
I'm reading the bottom right.

138
00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:09.550
It's water resistant.

139
00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:12.405
It's capable of 88 pounds.

140
00:08:12.405 --> 00:08:16.960
2.2 pounds is 1 kilogram.

141
00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:21.440
So it's capable of holding
enough weight for us.

142
00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:24.300
Essentially we can load in our battery,
load in all our components.

143
00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:26.470
We can load in maybe a few extra things,
the DragonBoard,

144
00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:31.290
the screen and and a tray that we need and

145
00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:36.028
we can just roll it away with no problem
at all, nothing is going to break.

146
00:08:36.028 --> 00:08:39.210
It's lockable and

147
00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:44.410
essentially you can see there that it has
pretty much everything we need in a case.

148
00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:47.992
We are hoping that you like our choice,
and

149
00:08:47.992 --> 00:08:51.759
again feel free to choose anything
that you are comfortable with.

150
00:08:51.759 --> 00:08:55.071
Now just a quick little anecdote
from us is that while we

151
00:08:55.071 --> 00:08:58.959
were choosing our components make
sure you have a tape measure,

152
00:08:58.959 --> 00:09:02.199
make sure you are constantly
measuring everything,

153
00:09:02.199 --> 00:09:07.167
because you are going to need to make sure
you, before you order anything make sure

154
00:09:07.167 --> 00:09:12.079
your components are going to fit nice and
snug and organized inside of your case.

155
00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:16.610
This is a problem because you're also
going to to have to take into account

156
00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:21.300
the cables, the connectors, the wiring,
the positioning of everything and

157
00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:27.540
make sure measure twice, cut once.

158
00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:29.810
Essentially measure twice, order once, and

159
00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:31.870
you will have the right
components that you need.

160
00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:33.710
Most of the time when you are ordering,

161
00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:36.060
there's sheets like this that
show you all the dimensions.

162
00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:38.420
So, you should be okay with that.

163
00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:39.960
I would recommend buying the case first,

164
00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:44.360
and then from there building
your system as you need it.

165
00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:48.370
So, as you've seen, these are all
the components that we will be using,

166
00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:50.180
there will be links provided to you.

167
00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:53.290
I will also be providing
to you the link for

168
00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:58.150
a particular five inch monitor that
we will be using in the system.

169
00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:05.420
I would suggest checking out all of
your options wherever you are and

170
00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:08.480
making this kit, this system, your own.

171
00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:10.717
Because that's what
the caption is all about.

172
00:10:10.717 --> 00:10:14.210
Making it your own and
using this as a guideline.

173
00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:16.190
So we will be providing for you a lot of

174
00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:22.100
really cool examples throughout
this especially in part two.

175
00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:26.700
But just keep that in mind that we will
look forward to seeing your ideas and

176
00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:28.290
your experiments.

177
00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:30.790
So, we'll see you in the next video.

178
00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:31.290
Thank you.
