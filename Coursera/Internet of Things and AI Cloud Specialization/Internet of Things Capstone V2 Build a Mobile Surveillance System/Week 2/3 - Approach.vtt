WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:01.540
All right.

2
00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:06.568
So we're ready to kind of dive
in to the cap stone project.

3
00:00:06.568 --> 00:00:11.497
But, before you just get to building
everything you need to kind of think

4
00:00:11.497 --> 00:00:13.560
about what you're going to do.

5
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.622
Now, lets lets take a work we're
going to do and talk about a little bit.

6
00:00:17.622 --> 00:00:20.973
We are going to build
a self sustainable Mobile,

7
00:00:20.973 --> 00:00:23.845
hopefully mobile surveillance system.

8
00:00:23.845 --> 00:00:25.090
[COUGH] Right?

9
00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.230
And also dragon board 410 C workstation.

10
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.610
So that being said, we're going to
have plenty of electrical components.

11
00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.910
Not only the dragon board 410 c, but

12
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.576
we're going to need to power sensors,
we're going to need a monitor.

13
00:00:39.576 --> 00:00:43.600
We're going to need possibly,

14
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.970
maybe some other, if we're out and about
and we don't have access to any light,

15
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:53.020
maybe it's night time, maybe we
want to power some light, so yeah,

16
00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.960
obviously the possibilities are endless,
right?

17
00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.618
So you can take anything you want and plug
it into the system, we're hoping at least.

18
00:01:01.618 --> 00:01:03.190
[COUGH] So, what do we need for this?

19
00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.640
Now, first we wanted to kind of
walk you through our process.

20
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.710
So wanted to research [COUGH] some
components, the system components,

21
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.840
but we want to research the system
components around the needs of the system.

22
00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.010
So, if we're pulling the DragonBoard,
if we're taking the DragonBoard and

23
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.280
the DragonBoard is obviously
going to be a load of the system.

24
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.670
Well, the power supply for the DragonBoard
and the power adaptor is 24 watts.

25
00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.330
You have 2 amps 12 volts, right?

26
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:37.120
Ohm's law, P = IV, the current times
the voltage, you get the power 24 watts.

27
00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.510
It all make sense.

28
00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.310
So we're going to need 24 watts.

29
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.850
And you can kind of go down
the list of items that you

30
00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.580
want to power with this system.

31
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.970
And basically, kind of mold
the components that you choose and

32
00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.760
research around what you want
the load of the system to be.

33
00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.360
Now since this is, of course,
a workstation for the DragonBoard,

34
00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.170
we are going to need to power that,
we're going to need a power monitor, so

35
00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.090
you're going to have to choose
a monitor that's within the specs.

36
00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.740
And we will be providing you with
a list of components that we used and

37
00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.220
proved to work with our system.

38
00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.680
So, we will be building
a mobile station for you.

39
00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.455
And we will provide you with
the list of components, you can,

40
00:02:15.455 --> 00:02:17.440
[COUGH] work around that list.

41
00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.310
You can choose to use the identical
components if you'd like, or

42
00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.630
you can make it more robust, bigger.

43
00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.900
Add more batteries, add more solar panels,
bigger charge controller, bigger inverter,

44
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.290
whatever you want, all right.

45
00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.150
So, once you've decided how big the load's
going to be for your system, and

46
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.900
you've done research on the right
components, well then you can, you know

47
00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.770
research may be you want to not use just
AC power but you want to use DC power.

48
00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.300
Now, we will go a little bit more in
depth in point two about this but

49
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.710
essentially you know at least for the most
prior we have what I've seen is AC power.

50
00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.810
We will talk about a little bit more
the difference between AC and DC power.

51
00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.950
Suffice to say,
AC power has a lot higher voltage.

52
00:03:03.358 --> 00:03:06.435
And for the most parts, our DC power is
going to be a lower voltage that we're

53
00:03:06.435 --> 00:03:07.970
dealing with in this case.

54
00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.338
So, we will be using a 12 volt battery.

55
00:03:11.338 --> 00:03:16.215
And we will be using an inverter
to step the 12 volts up

56
00:03:16.215 --> 00:03:21.112
to 110 volts and
provide AC current [COUGH] AC power.

57
00:03:21.112 --> 00:03:26.090
So, if you wanted to use, for instance,
only DC, you don't need an inverter.

58
00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.920
And you could just power it
straight from the 12 volt battery.

59
00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:36.670
Most electronics already have
regulators inside their adaptors so,

60
00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:42.620
if you wanted to plug in a, for

61
00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:48.120
instance a cell phone or
something that requires a five volts in

62
00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.360
most cases they have the little regulator
in the device that steps it down for you.

63
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.460
There are lots of other components
you can buy online that

64
00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:00.910
will provide step-downs and regulates
the voltage to whatever you'd like.

65
00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:06.468
If you choose to go DC, we will also talk
about about that in capstone part two.

66
00:04:06.468 --> 00:04:09.607
Giving you some options on some DC
components that you might want to add to

67
00:04:09.607 --> 00:04:10.280
your systems.

68
00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.742
Overall, it saves you a little
bit of power but in the long run,

69
00:04:16.742 --> 00:04:18.828
it's not so substantial.

70
00:04:18.828 --> 00:04:21.230
So yeah,
now you've chosen your components.

71
00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:22.564
You've decided if you want it AC DC.

72
00:04:22.564 --> 00:04:25.058
You're going to purchase your components.

73
00:04:25.058 --> 00:04:25.617
So obviously,

74
00:04:25.617 --> 00:04:28.420
there's going to be a little bit of a gap
there while you order your components.

75
00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:29.690
Figure out what you want.

76
00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.080
Get it all set up.

77
00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.909
Everything shows up to your house and
you're ready to go.

78
00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:36.468
Make sure you read all
your instruction manuals.

79
00:04:36.468 --> 00:04:38.218
Get in tune with your components.

80
00:04:38.218 --> 00:04:44.360
Make sure, double check your math and
then you start to build your system.

81
00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.090
From there, we'll set up our surveillance,
we'll set up our DragonBoard 410 C

82
00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:51.420
on the system, and we'll make
sure that it can run and charge.

83
00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.340
And we'll make sure that it's portable.

84
00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.150
And we'll start having fun with it.

85
00:04:56.228 --> 00:05:01.110
All right, so, I just wanted to
kind of show you a little diagram

86
00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.170
of a mock system that
we came up with here.

87
00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:10.600
So, for those of you who aren't familiar
with all the components that may go

88
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:15.415
into a solar powered,
self sustainable solar powered system,

89
00:05:15.415 --> 00:05:20.060
[COUGH] you can kind of see
up here on the screen, and

90
00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:25.860
I'm going to walk you through it real
quick, what everything is about.

91
00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.768
So if we start on the left side,
you can see it's there, it says Panels.

92
00:05:29.768 --> 00:05:32.240
So that's where your Panels start.

93
00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.710
That's where the original power
from the Sun is collected.

94
00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:41.080
The Panels led out DC power.

95
00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.930
So [COUGH] from the Panels,

96
00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:50.130
you're already collecting energy and you
want to sent it to your batteries, right.

97
00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:54.000
But the problem is, is that with
batteries you can't overcharge them,

98
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.720
you can't undercharge them,
you have to have them properly regulated.

99
00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:02.130
And so in order to do that, we have a
great device called the charge controller.

100
00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:06.630
So in between the solar panels and
the batteries is the charge controller.

101
00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:08.260
Now again we're going to
be providing you lists for

102
00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.610
all the components that we
chose to use for our system.

103
00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:12.990
You can shop around and

104
00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:17.470
find similar specifications or components
with similar specifications more or less.

105
00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:20.880
However you'd like to pair and
set your system up.

106
00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.750
So again, we're going from the solar
panels to the charge controller,

107
00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:27.060
and then from the charge
controller to the batteries.

108
00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:30.965
That is going to basically say, the charge
controller says, hey our batteries,

109
00:06:30.965 --> 00:06:32.619
they're already charged enough.

110
00:06:32.619 --> 00:06:34.960
So let's cut off the solar panels for now.

111
00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.790
We don't want to overcharge our batteries.

112
00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:40.750
Or it'll It will get it input from
the batteries and it will say, hey,

113
00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:44.800
these batteries are running low, quick, we
need to start charging up the batteries.

114
00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.090
In which case it will open it up and
start charging the batteries.

115
00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:50.640
So, hopefully,
I would recommend pausing this and

116
00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:53.870
kind of following along with me kind of
tracing with your finger if you have to.

117
00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:55.620
But right now we are at
the charge controller and

118
00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:00.200
as you can see there is still
DC flowing in to the batteries.

119
00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:06.050
Now, if we just hooked up for
instance a plus and a minus

120
00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:10.060
to the batteries we would hopefully
get somewhere right above 12 volts.

121
00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:13.600
Here I have four batteries in series,

122
00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.460
this just kind of shows that hey you're
going to have as many batteries as you

123
00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:21.470
want as long as the specs
match your other devices.

124
00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:24.410
So you charge until your inverter,
everything has to be kind of match or

125
00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:27.400
within the range of those devices.

126
00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:29.878
For our case, we're only end up using
one batteries, I mean one battery.

127
00:07:29.878 --> 00:07:32.520
So, we'll have right around 12 volts.

128
00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:35.340
So hopefully a little more than
12 volts when we measure that.

129
00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:40.343
If we had the device that requires
12 volts, then we could essentially

130
00:07:40.343 --> 00:07:44.620
hook it up to the batteries and
it would just provide us the DC.

131
00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:49.300
We would be able to charge our item or
run it off from there.

132
00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:52.060
So for example,
the dragon word four ten C, right?

133
00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:53.487
12 volts, one amp.

134
00:07:53.487 --> 00:07:58.267
We would just be able to run a socket
from the batteries, plug it in, and

135
00:07:58.267 --> 00:08:01.469
the adapter will take
care of everything else.

136
00:08:01.469 --> 00:08:03.540
It'll make sure that it's
only getting 12 volts.

137
00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:05.110
It'll make sure that
the amperage is right.

138
00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:11.670
And [COUGH] we will be able to power the
DragonBoard 410c right from the batteries.

139
00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:14.849
However, we don't want to limit our
self to just the DragonBoard 410c.

140
00:08:14.849 --> 00:08:16.820
We want to be able to power anything.

141
00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:18.510
Maybe you're hot and you want to fan.

142
00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:19.890
Again, like I said, you want lights.

143
00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:22.370
So, that's when we need the inverter.

144
00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:27.659
The inverter, the opposite of a converter,
steps up your voltage.

145
00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:33.320
So, what we do is you can
now follow again the screen.

146
00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:36.000
We've gone from the panels
to the charge controller,

147
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.660
which is kind of like the brain that
decides how to charge the batteries.

148
00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:45.310
And then from the DC that the batteries
provide, we run it through the inverter.

149
00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:52.583
It converts between AC and
steps up [COUGH] the voltage.

150
00:08:52.583 --> 00:08:54.950
So, the inverter that we will be using,

151
00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:00.930
we'll talk about later we where
going to pulling 350 watts.

152
00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:04.890
So what you can kind of imagine is,
[COUGH] if we have 350 watts

153
00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:08.060
are capable of 350 watts
the DragonBoard uses 24 watts.

154
00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:09.620
You could be charging a phone.

155
00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:12.900
A phone is usually one amp five volts,
so, five watts.

156
00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:14.470
So now you've got 29 watts.

157
00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:20.610
Add a fan, add a light bulb I don't know,
energy saving 15 watt light bulbs.

158
00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:22.000
So now you're pulling 15 more watts.

159
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.710
Right, so you're going to start adding
these things up and you can kind of say,

160
00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:29.690
okay well my inverter's definitely high
enough to power everything that I need.

161
00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:33.461
But what you would do from
there is you can step up your

162
00:09:33.461 --> 00:09:36.048
inverter to get you more watts etc.

163
00:09:36.048 --> 00:09:39.970
So, this is kind of what we use
to walk through our process.

164
00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:42.990
And we went from the panels.

165
00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:45.850
Well I should say, we went from
our load what we wanted to power.

166
00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:49.760
And then we reach to each
individual component and

167
00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:53.950
made sure that it was capable
of powering what we wanted.

168
00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:57.140
Again, we're going to go more in depth on
this, I just wanted to show you a little

169
00:09:57.140 --> 00:10:02.760
bit of the process and how we thought
our way through creating this system.

170
00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:07.210
[COUGH] So stick around for the next
video, where will talk more specific

171
00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:11.420
about the components that we are going to
be using for our particular project.

172
00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:14.650
And later on, we will actually
go through a fun example of

173
00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:19.890
something we built in the past here
at UCSD and hopefully you enjoy it.

174
00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:22.520
Wait around for part two and
we'll get more involved and

175
00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:23.510
actually build something for you.
