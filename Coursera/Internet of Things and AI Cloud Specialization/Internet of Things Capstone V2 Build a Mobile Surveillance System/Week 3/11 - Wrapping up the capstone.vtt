00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.200
That takes you all to the end
of this awesome capstone.

2
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.530
Hopefully, you learned a lot.

3
00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:10.380
I would suggest you all take
a look at the links and

4
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.140
other resources that we're providing
you at the end of this course.

5
00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:22.110
By this time you should have
hopefully been able to build or

6
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.880
at least get a great idea for
your capstone.

7
00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.720
We hope to see a lot of really cool
stuff from everyone on the discussions.

8
00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.940
Please post pictures,
explain your system as best as possible.

9
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.260
Imagine right here, we have the camera
set up now, but course five when we did

10
00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.030
the multimedia and we set up an
application to constantly take pictures.

11
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.420
I think it was every three seconds or
five seconds or whatever it was.

12
00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.520
You're inside your tent,
you're out camping,

13
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.730
you have this propped
up outside your tent.

14
00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.490
You've already been charging it all day,
right?

15
00:00:54.490 --> 00:01:00.920
So you have access to all the pictures
that this is taking throughout the night.

16
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.465
If anything pops up,
maybe you CV if it detects a face.

17
00:01:04.465 --> 00:01:05.940
Could send you an alert.

18
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.040
All sorts of really cool stuff.

19
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.090
Stuff that you are able to do with
the camera, the the simple CV,

20
00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.970
and the stuff that you learned
throughout the other courses.

21
00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:21.175
Putting in a PIR sensor,
hooking up all sorts of crazy actuators.

22
00:01:21.175 --> 00:01:27.330
Maybe a light sensor that,
we mounted ours on here, but what if you

23
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.740
wanted to put your solar panels over here
and have an actuator with a stepper motor.

24
00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.940
That is guided by the light sensor,
so as the sun moves,

25
00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:42.800
the solar panels will also
shift with the sun, right?

26
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.340
So again, the possibilities are endless.

27
00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.800
We just wanted to provide you with kind
of a template for you to build around.

28
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.660
You don't have to spend
as much money as we did.

29
00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.300
You can spend a lot more and
you can spend less.

30
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:55.580
It's kind of up to you.

31
00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.150
On how intricate you'd like to make your
system and how long you'd like it to last.

32
00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.130
So again hope you had fun.

33
00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.900
We look forward to seeing you in
later courses, other specializations,

34
00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.670
who knows what we'll be doing next.

35
00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.100
But you know, keep with Coursera.

36
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.500
Follow us.

37
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.610
Check us out online anywhere you can
find us and we hope you had a good time.

38
00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.720
We'll see you around.
