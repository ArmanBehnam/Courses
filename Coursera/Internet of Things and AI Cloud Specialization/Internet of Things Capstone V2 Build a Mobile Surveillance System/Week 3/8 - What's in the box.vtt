1
00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.630
We are ready now to kind of look and
see what we have packaged up in here,

2
00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:09.110
as I said in the introduction, we are
going to take a look at some of the tools.

3
00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.130
Most of the tools that I use for building
this, as well as all of the components

4
00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:18.170
that went in to making this happen, so
this is our self-sustainable, solar

5
00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:24.790
self-sustainable DragonBoard 410c work
station and potential surveillance system.

6
00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:26.710
So inside this box,

7
00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.090
as you can see, at least right here,
we have a little flap that comes out.

8
00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:32.740
This is for the wheels, right.

9
00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.640
But we expand our station here.

10
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.610
And you can see we have
our DragonBoard 410c.

11
00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:41.890
Which is kind of the brain of the system.

12
00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.450
We have our power supply for
it which we'll be using later.

13
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.610
We have some cool little sensors and
you went over that in course three.

14
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.200
This is our actuator, I'm sorry,
the stepper motor that we used.

15
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.810
You know in case you wanted to do some
VOIP, we have our head set there and

16
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:11.463
then, you know maybe a little, Live webcam
that you might want to use [SOUND] and

17
00:01:11.463 --> 00:01:17.201
then we have [SOUND] of course the monitor
here which you will definitely

18
00:01:17.201 --> 00:01:23.831
need if you're going to be doing any sort
of programming outside on the desktop.

19
00:01:23.831 --> 00:01:27.360
Or if you're running Android or anything
like that you don't want to use ADB.

20
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.560
I have a full size, almost full size
keyboard, you know, for the programming.

21
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.480
And then I have a little
miniature one here too, so

22
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.810
maybe you want to Make your
system a little more compact.

23
00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:37.810
Those are both bluetooth.

24
00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.990
And a really cool sensor kit
from Grove Sensors here.

25
00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.035
Inside here we have
a bunch of I2C sensors.

26
00:01:47.035 --> 00:01:50.679
Here's light sensors, motion sensors,

27
00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:54.632
[NOISE] pressure sensors,
little LCD screen.

28
00:01:54.632 --> 00:01:56.885
Underneath here, we have the sensor board.

29
00:01:56.885 --> 00:01:59.585
This is new to the 96
boards at our website.

30
00:01:59.585 --> 00:02:01.065
You can check all this out and

31
00:02:01.065 --> 00:02:05.475
I will be providing links at
the bottom of the videos here.

32
00:02:05.475 --> 00:02:06.565
We'll put this over here.

33
00:02:06.565 --> 00:02:12.300
[COUGH] And the power supply of course for
the screen,

34
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.650
so this is just the beginning,
this is the stuff we're going to use.

35
00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.000
Right now, I want to kind of talk
about a little more of the tools here.

36
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.100
So, I use this just a little
all purpose screw driver,

37
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.120
this helped me with putting
some of the stuff together.

38
00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.330
Crimper, wire cutters, some bungees.

39
00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.240
Let me see what we got here.

40
00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.710
These bungees are going to hold down the
battery and I'll explain a little bit more

41
00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:39.170
about why we chose these bungees instead
of building a whole battery casing.

42
00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.330
Have a little volt meter.

43
00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.820
You know,
I noticed that the solar panels we bought,

44
00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:50.820
they didn't have a positive or
a negative side to the connectors.

45
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.460
So I was like how am I going to find out,
you know,

46
00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.200
how to plug it into the charge controller?

47
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.830
So you just use your volt meter there, and
you'll find out where the positive and

48
00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:00.700
the negative sides are.

49
00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.280
And The solar panels.

50
00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.160
Let's move this over here now.

51
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.680
These solar panels right here.

52
00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.140
We have two solar panels, right.

53
00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:16.296
And these are as we talked about in
part one, the ten watts, 17.9 volts.

54
00:03:16.296 --> 00:03:21.440
22.4 open current, open circuit volts.

55
00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.290
And then short circuit amps .61.

56
00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.300
So we're going to kind of decide how we
want to set those up, hooking them up to

57
00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:34.460
the wire of the box after, another bungee
here, after we hook everything up.

58
00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:35.500
And then the battery.

59
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.600
So this is kind of a heavy duty battery.

60
00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.270
We chose 18 amp hours here.

61
00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.640
You can again make your system
as powerful as you want.

62
00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.380
Our system is actually capable of
faking multiple of these batteries and

63
00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:51.490
when you see the inside of this box,

64
00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:54.040
you're going to see how much
extra space we actually have.

65
00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:59.240
So you want your system to be able to,
for emergency cases,

66
00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:03.400
you're out in the wild for two, three
days, and say it's raining, or you're

67
00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:08.130
covered by a bunch of trees in the forest
and you're not getting much sunlight.

68
00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.630
Well, you might want to have
more batteries with you.

69
00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:16.410
This of course adds to the weight, which
in turn, there's always a compromise.

70
00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.450
So let me see here.

71
00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.630
One last thing, this was just kind
of a cool thing that we pick up.

72
00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.820
So we have this kind of
big old clunky monitor.

73
00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.810
And when we show you
the inside of this box,

74
00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.690
you're going to kind of
see why we picked this.

75
00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.300
Because this is a really cool
little monitor, five inch monitor.

76
00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:37.640
I would encourage anyone out there
that want to buy this monitor

77
00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:41.890
It's from Waveshare, and I would encourage
anyone out there who wants to buy this

78
00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:45.040
monitor to get on there,
try to build some STL file.

79
00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:50.260
Let's get a hard shell, 3D printed case
going for this because it's really cool.

80
00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.550
And it would be really nice to get
a nice 3D printed case for this monitor.

81
00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:58.890
Something that we can mount inside
the solar powered system here.

82
00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:00.360
Just going to kind of place
this right here as well.

83
00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.890
So, one last thing.

84
00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:06.830
This is a lot of stuff that
we pulled out of the box but

85
00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:08.700
we're going to kind of
take a look around here.

86
00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.400
And take a look at the last
two components of this box

87
00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:17.280
which are the Inverter here, and
this is a 450 watt inverter.

88
00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.520
I know in part one I talked
about a 350 watt inverter.

89
00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:26.480
We upped it by 100 watts
only because this inverter

90
00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.520
was a little more simple with the two
sockets here that it provides.

91
00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.770
The other one only had a USB socket.

92
00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:38.200
Turns out our charge controller up here,
actually had it's own USB

93
00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:43.805
sockets so we didn't have to, we didn't
really need to install any extra stuff for

94
00:05:43.805 --> 00:05:48.375
that, you can see we have our panels,

95
00:05:48.375 --> 00:05:52.985
our inverter, our battery coming in here
we'll explain all of these later, but

96
00:05:52.985 --> 00:05:57.525
there's ample space inside here and
we're going to start building it so

97
00:05:57.525 --> 00:06:00.955
you can see it all come together in
just a minute in the next video.

98
00:06:00.955 --> 00:06:03.620
So kind of take a look at all this.

99
00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:04.670
Stuff here on the table.

100
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:08.370
And we're going to fit all of this
back in, minus the tools, but

101
00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:11.960
we're going to fit all this
back inside of the case.

102
00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.340
And make it a nice
comfortable workstation for

103
00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:16.860
you to build with your DragonBoard 410c.

104
00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.410
See you in the next videos.
