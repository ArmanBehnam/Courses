00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:01.520
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:08.050
And welcome to part two, the final
part in the capstone course here for

3
00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:14.770
the Internet of things, University of
California, San Diego specialization.

4
00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:21.880
So as promised, you kind of see this big
box here, 15 gallon DeWALT tool box.

5
00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.270
Now, we explained in the first
part of this course that

6
00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.070
you can choose anything you want for
your box,

7
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.310
as long as you match the specifications
for all of the devices and

8
00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.470
components that you want to use and
everything fits inside the box.

9
00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.430
Then you should be good to go, right.

10
00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.530
Now for this introduction video,
to the second part, I wanted

11
00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.590
to just pull out everything I have in
the box and show it to you real quickly.

12
00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.310
After that we are going to walk
through all of the components that we

13
00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:55.240
have in here.

14
00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.050
That includes the tools that I used for
building this.

15
00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.140
Some tools I have on me.

16
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.180
Some tools of course I don't.

17
00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.840
As well as variety of
the components we ended up using.

18
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.960
After that, I'm going to kind of walk
you through the building process as

19
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.540
you can see, I already have a lot
of these wires hooked in here.

20
00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.440
And this will go to the solar panels.

21
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.910
We'll talk about that in the video after.

22
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.130
And then from there,
I'm going to build it for you.

23
00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.590
Once again, putting all the components
back in and we will do a little demo

24
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.790
outside to show that it is in
fact collecting solar energy and

25
00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.250
how much load we might be able to
provide for what we have created here.

26
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.490
As well as maybe hooking
up the DragonBoard and

27
00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:38.850
having some fun with some sensors.

28
00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.500
So I look forward to seeing
you in the next video.

29
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.140
Stay tuned.

30
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.310
While we look at everything
that's inside the old box here.
