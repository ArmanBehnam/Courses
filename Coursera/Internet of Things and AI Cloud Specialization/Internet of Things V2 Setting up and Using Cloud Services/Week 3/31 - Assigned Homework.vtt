Hello, and welcome to the assigned
homework video for the Greengrass lesson.

2
00:00:05.294 --> 00:00:09.200
And we're just going to be going over
some stuff that we want you to look at.

3
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.010
So first part is that all these links and
everything that we mention

4
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.920
will be provided in the reading
sections of Coursera, so

5
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.070
be sure to look there for links.

6
00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.830
We will not be providing it on this slide.

7
00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.280
So the first thing we want you to do for
the homework is read up on Greengrass.

8
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.860
Go to their documentation and
go to their about page and

9
00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.110
just try to read up on how it works and
how to use API.

10
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.685
And the next part is trying
the Greengrass demo for yourself.

11
00:00:34.685 --> 00:00:39.135
So what we have set up,
set that up on your own devices,

12
00:00:39.135 --> 00:00:42.785
your own laptop and your own dragon
board and just get it working.

13
00:00:42.785 --> 00:00:45.343
And after that,
after you've built the small demo project,

14
00:00:45.343 --> 00:00:48.005
you should have a pretty good
understanding of how it works.

15
00:00:48.005 --> 00:00:51.695
So we want you to build a small
project using AWS Greengrass.

16
00:00:51.695 --> 00:00:56.630
And our requirements are that it has to
use AWS Lambda running on the Greengrass

17
00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.230
core, and
AWS IoT running on that core also.

18
00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.470
You can use it in any way you want,
just have it running on there.

19
00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:04.250
And yep.

20
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.990
So after that you should have a pretty
good understanding of just how to use

21
00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.080
Greengrass.

22
00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.740
I can't wait to see what
projects you guys come up with.

23
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.860
And stay tuned for more videos as we
also have more interesting projects

24
00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:15.860
ourselves to present to you.
