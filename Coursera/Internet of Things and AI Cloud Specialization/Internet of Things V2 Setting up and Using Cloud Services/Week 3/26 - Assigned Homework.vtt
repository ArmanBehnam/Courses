00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.506
Welcome, everyone, you've made it to
the end of the MNIST API project.

2
00:00:04.506 --> 00:00:08.082
And we just wanted to give you some
homework to do while waiting for

3
00:00:08.082 --> 00:00:09.065
the next lesson.

4
00:00:09.065 --> 00:00:11.504
So here the first part is some readings.

5
00:00:11.504 --> 00:00:14.652
So we'll provide some links
to each of these readings and

6
00:00:14.652 --> 00:00:16.440
the topics that we want to cover.

7
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.820
But you'll be reading about machine
learning, the Tensorflow framework,

8
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:27.290
the MNIST data set, and
the Flask web server framework for Python.

9
00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:30.240
And the next two parts that we want
you to do are actually try this part

10
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:30.898
just for yourself.

11
00:00:30.898 --> 00:00:34.990
So git clone the project, download
the weights, set it up on a server, and

12
00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:39.280
just send in an image using
the client that we've provided.

13
00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.770
And the next part, the last part,
just try using it as part of a project.

14
00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.248
Maybe you can make a small project
using it, and just callbacks,

15
00:00:47.248 --> 00:00:49.109
just try integrating into something.

16
00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:52.447
Integrating something else into it or
add this to another project.

17
00:00:52.447 --> 00:00:55.362
So yeah, that's all we have for
the assigned homework here, and

18
00:00:55.362 --> 00:00:57.750
make sure you read everything
that we've provided.
