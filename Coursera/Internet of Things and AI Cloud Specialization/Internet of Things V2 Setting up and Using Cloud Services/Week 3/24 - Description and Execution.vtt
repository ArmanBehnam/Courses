Hello, everyone. In this video we're going over the Environment Alert System.

2
00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:08.360
It actually uses the DragonBoard sensors,

3
00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.965
and sends us a notification whenever one of the sensors reads over,

4
00:00:12.965 --> 00:00:15.245
or below us in the threshold.

5
00:00:15.245 --> 00:00:19.370
So here are some of the hardware requirements that we need for this project.

6
00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:21.160
First, you would need the Sensors Mezzanine,

7
00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.820
and then the three Grove Connectors.

8
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.205
And then here we specified where you need to connect your temperature, light,

9
00:00:28.205 --> 00:00:33.600
and sound sensors which is A0, A1, A2, respectively.

10
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:42.885
And then this uses the same parts that we showed on the sensor stream demo.

11
00:00:42.885 --> 00:00:47.525
And this time we're going to use AWS's SNS or

12
00:00:47.525 --> 00:00:52.490
Simple Notification Service to trigger not really text,

13
00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.685
but email under certain conditions.

14
00:00:54.685 --> 00:00:58.700
And these conditions are defined by the light, temperature, and sound.

15
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.345
So basically, if it's really dark in the room

16
00:01:02.345 --> 00:01:07.040
below 100 then it will send us a notification saying that the light is too low.

17
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.110
And then for temperature and sound,

18
00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:15.425
the thing needs to be above threshold in order for us to get the notification.

19
00:01:15.425 --> 00:01:22.015
So, let's go to the DragonBoard to see how everything is connected.

20
00:01:22.015 --> 00:01:25.355
So, here we are at the camera shot of our DragonBoard.

21
00:01:25.355 --> 00:01:30.341
And the first sensor which is connected to this one over here,

22
00:01:30.341 --> 00:01:32.835
is the temperature sensor.

23
00:01:32.835 --> 00:01:35.559
And the one connected to this one over here,

24
00:01:35.559 --> 00:01:37.685
this would be the light sensor.

25
00:01:37.685 --> 00:01:42.025
And then the one connected to A2 over here is the sound sensor.

26
00:01:42.025 --> 00:01:45.974
So, let's check out how this thing works.

27
00:01:45.974 --> 00:01:52.520
Here we are at our directory for module two of course three.

28
00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.650
And then let's look for alert system.

29
00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:02.300
And then let's move into our DragonBoard Directory. And then here we are.

30
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.695
And if you ls, you see a bunch of security stuff that we're not going to cover.

31
00:02:06.695 --> 00:02:12.153
But what we're really worried about is the setAlert.py script.

32
00:02:12.153 --> 00:02:17.735
So, let's just run this and see what it does.

33
00:02:17.735 --> 00:02:23.467
And then if we run this it should display streaming to AWS as it does right now,

34
00:02:23.467 --> 00:02:26.330
this means that everything is going into AWS.

35
00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.291
If we jump to my computer,

36
00:02:28.291 --> 00:02:32.930
we can see here that on the IoT Testing,

37
00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.540
we have subscribed to the environment topic which is

38
00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.005
the same topic that the DragonBoard is set on.

39
00:02:39.005 --> 00:02:44.980
So you can see all the streaming data here.

40
00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.155
We can see sounds changing relevant.

41
00:02:47.155 --> 00:02:49.730
So if you just clap will make it louder.

42
00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:56.855
Yeah. So let me just do a really embarrassing yell into the sound sensor.

43
00:02:56.855 --> 00:03:00.270
Yeah. So it went to 800 and it hurt my ears.

44
00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.330
Let's see.

45
00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.820
Now, we set an alert for this,

46
00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:08.855
so that on this one it changes it too.

47
00:03:08.855 --> 00:03:11.283
So this one's for the light,

48
00:03:11.283 --> 00:03:12.370
it takes the light, temperature,

49
00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.635
and sound and sets it to the environment topic.

50
00:03:15.635 --> 00:03:18.605
And if the light goes under 100 it will send me an email.

51
00:03:18.605 --> 00:03:21.185
So let's just try that right now.

52
00:03:21.185 --> 00:03:25.500
So let's just cover the light sensor with [inaudible].

53
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.735
195.

54
00:03:27.735 --> 00:03:29.964
So if you jump over here and we refresh,

55
00:03:29.964 --> 00:03:31.280
it should send me an email.

56
00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.160
It might take a sec.

57
00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.115
Wait light is it under 280?

58
00:03:37.115 --> 00:03:41.530
It's 295 actually. Try to make it lower.

59
00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:49.905
512. Let me see.

60
00:03:49.905 --> 00:03:52.930
So if you cover it well

61
00:03:52.930 --> 00:04:00.160
with no light getting in, that should trigger an email.

62
00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.850
And then you can see here we got this email,

63
00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.315
it wasn't the one we wanted.

64
00:04:06.315 --> 00:04:08.120
Okay. These are some old ones.

65
00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.319
This the new email right here,

66
00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:12.135
the light under 73,

67
00:04:12.135 --> 00:04:16.110
and we've got some other ones under 89, under 78.

68
00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:19.060
So, we can use this on some of the other sensors

69
00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.090
too to trigger certain things about your environment.

70
00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.770
Let's say you're monitoring your lizard or

71
00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.264
something and you want to keep the temperature at the exact temperature,

72
00:04:27.264 --> 00:04:30.590
and if it ever went too hot or too cold for it might die.

73
00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.590
So, you want to alert yourself if that ever happens,

74
00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.825
so you can come back home and make sure your lizard doesn't die.

75
00:04:37.825 --> 00:04:45.435
So that was an example of how to use sensors with SNS integration.

76
00:04:45.435 --> 00:04:48.125
You can also include text.

77
00:04:48.125 --> 00:04:49.700
Make sure not to hit the limit on that,

78
00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:51.350
because it's actually much lower than email limit.

79
00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.120
You can use text to notify you or email.

80
00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.080
And you can integrate this to any of

81
00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.000
your projects and make it a little bit more exciting.
