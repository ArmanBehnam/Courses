00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:07.928
Hello everyone. In this video we'll be going over the Facebook chatbot project.

2
00:00:07.928 --> 00:00:13.555
Essentially, it's an automated chatbot that you can interact with on Facebook.

3
00:00:13.555 --> 00:00:17.265
We're just going to give a brief overview first.

4
00:00:17.265 --> 00:00:22.070
And the first thing we're going to go over is a chatbot structure;

5
00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.905
the structure using Facebook and the structure using AWS.

6
00:00:25.905 --> 00:00:28.175
After that, we're going to go over a description of what the project

7
00:00:28.175 --> 00:00:32.235
is and then, execution.

8
00:00:32.235 --> 00:00:37.615
So, first off, the chatbot structure has two parts: Facebook and AWS.

9
00:00:37.615 --> 00:00:38.880
The first part is Facebook.

10
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.820
You need a Facebook page to message something to message to.

11
00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.640
And then a Facebook app so that

12
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.375
it can take in the messages from the page and send it to AWS.

13
00:00:49.375 --> 00:00:51.135
Just a quick note, if you don't have Facebook

14
00:00:51.135 --> 00:00:53.620
available you can use it with other services such as Slack or

15
00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.920
Kik or even some other services that just have a chat integration.

16
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.000
And then the second part that we need,

17
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.190
as you've been using alot, is AWS.

18
00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.455
We need to first create a Lex Bot,

19
00:01:05.455 --> 00:01:11.860
which will process the messages and create intents from Facebook and then you need

20
00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:18.755
a Lambda function to process those intents and that will trigger an SNS topic.

21
00:01:18.755 --> 00:01:23.405
And then that SNS topic or Simple Notification Service,

22
00:01:23.405 --> 00:01:26.990
sends that invoice to owner through text message and email.

23
00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.980
And, just to note, all services for this bot should be in

24
00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.360
US East one that's north Virginia.

25
00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:40.790
I tried using SNS on Oregon region and then Lex Bot on the US East region.

26
00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.610
It couldn't actually access it.

27
00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.835
So we have to keep them all in the same region and

28
00:01:45.835 --> 00:01:48.310
Lex Bot is only offered in two regions: I think

29
00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.685
Ireland for EU and US East One which is north Virginia on the US side,

30
00:01:53.685 --> 00:01:55.750
those are the only two endpoints that we have.

31
00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.090
So we just go on to the description.

32
00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.850
Basically, it's an easy chatbot to allow users

33
00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.380
to use their favorite messaging platforms to access certain services.

34
00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.415
It makes it a lot better user interaction.

35
00:02:06.415 --> 00:02:07.630
So, in this specific demo,

36
00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.730
we'll be ordering just food from

37
00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:13.680
a restaurant and sending it to a specific location for delivery.

38
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.650
And we'll just go to the execution right now on my computer.

39
00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.550
As you can see here, we are just on Facebook.

40
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.310
This is a Facebook page I created specifically for this project.

41
00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.260
You can just easily create one as long as you have Facebook account and it's

42
00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.720
important that if you're doing this with Facebook you don't click

43
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.170
the send message button because that does something different.

44
00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.780
You want to do test button because you are an admin,

45
00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.200
so you actually have permit.

46
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:47.310
And then here, we have a nice, just a chat interface to talk with the Facebook page.

47
00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.535
So, let's say I want food,

48
00:02:49.535 --> 00:02:52.540
I'll even misspell it and you can see it'll work fine.

49
00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.009
And it will understands with

50
00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:58.945
Amazon's Natural Language Processing that it means I want food,

51
00:02:58.945 --> 00:03:03.030
because it's one of the sample utterances as we will see in the future.

52
00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.350
Basically asks, "What do I want the food from?"

53
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.665
So let's say, " McDonald's",

54
00:03:08.665 --> 00:03:12.620
and then it asks, "What would I like to order?"

55
00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.905
So let's say, "Just fries."

56
00:03:15.905 --> 00:03:19.805
And, where would I like to have the order delivered to?

57
00:03:19.805 --> 00:03:21.455
So, since I'm at UCSD right now,

58
00:03:21.455 --> 00:03:25.380
we'll just send it to UCSD.

59
00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:29.796
And just confirming everything that I've said,

60
00:03:29.796 --> 00:03:34.345
so do I want to order fries from McDonald's and have it all delivered to UCSD?

61
00:03:34.345 --> 00:03:38.290
Yes. And it's processed it.

62
00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.560
And it says "Your order has been placed. "

63
00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:46.806
Now just a quick note, it also sends an email and a text to the owner per se,

64
00:03:46.806 --> 00:03:48.430
like owner of this Facebook page.

65
00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.705
For example, if I own a McDonald's and I wanted to deliver food to people,

66
00:03:52.705 --> 00:03:56.390
I can just have an email service set up so that I can check it every now and then.

67
00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.140
And if there's a new message that tells me an order,

68
00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.245
then I can actually see it and then place the order.

69
00:04:02.245 --> 00:04:07.360
So we can see here, here is the e-mail and it says order placed and restaurant that it

70
00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.020
wants is McDonald's and the food that they want to order

71
00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.855
is fries and where I send it to is UC, San Diego.

72
00:04:13.855 --> 00:04:16.820
That says address but it's just working on a general thing.

73
00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.745
You can make it all more complex to accept

74
00:04:18.745 --> 00:04:22.300
only certain user inputs and just ask, basically,

75
00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.160
if I said UCSD, you'd say "Oh,

76
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.620
what specific location that you want it to?"

77
00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.420
Another thing is, it also sends it to my phone.

78
00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.050
You cant really see it well but it does send

79
00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:37.390
a text using the Simple Notification Service.

80
00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:42.190
So again, this is just a quick demonstration of how you could integrate

81
00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.170
natural language processing offered through

82
00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:48.595
Amazon Lex into platforms that you may use everyday such as Facebook.

83
00:04:48.595 --> 00:04:53.470
And how it can be, used for a business or some kind of other applications.

84
00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:56.435
And the video after this we'll be going over

85
00:04:56.435 --> 00:05:01.000
just general setup and like tips and tricks about creating this chatbot.
