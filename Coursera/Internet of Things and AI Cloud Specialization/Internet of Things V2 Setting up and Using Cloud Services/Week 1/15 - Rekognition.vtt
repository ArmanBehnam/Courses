00:00:01.252 --> 00:00:07.200
Hello, in this video, we'll be going
over the Amazon web service Rekognition.

2
00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.837
>> And first, we're going to
describe what Rekognition is, and

3
00:00:13.837 --> 00:00:19.260
then we're going to upload the image
through S3, which is another service.

4
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.380
And then we're going to
detect labels using AWS CLI.

5
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.836
And then we're going to also show how to
detect labels using AWS SDK for Python.

6
00:00:28.836 --> 00:00:32.780
>> Yeah, so [COUGH] we're just
going to jump to my laptop.

7
00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:38.480
And then we can see here, and
we're going to go the Rekognition.

8
00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.002
So you can see here on the console that-
>> You might want to make it bigger.

9
00:00:43.002 --> 00:00:45.193
>> Yeah, it's a little small, so

10
00:00:45.193 --> 00:00:51.290
you can see here that Rekognition's all
the way under Artificial Intelligence.

11
00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:56.820
So if you click it, you'll head to this,
just a brief description of what it is.

12
00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.110
Essentially, you can give Amazon an image,
and it can detect some labels in it,

13
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.078
like what objects it sees inside it.

14
00:01:03.078 --> 00:01:06.290
And then whatever services
like detecting faces and

15
00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.670
seeing whether or
not there's a face inside.

16
00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:15.470
So we're just going to try it out with
our own image that we find off Google.

17
00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.282
So here you can see just a description,

18
00:01:19.282 --> 00:01:23.710
all those nice graphics to make you
think it's a brain looking thing.

19
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.440
I'm just going to go to
the Get Started guide.

20
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.960
Now here, you can go to
getting started using the API,

21
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.720
and detecting labels API.

22
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.727
So here is the code you guys can use for

23
00:01:38.727 --> 00:01:43.830
running this,
I'll just close out some of these.

24
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.945
And [COUGH] so here is a command
line version, where if you have

25
00:01:48.945 --> 00:01:55.150
an image in an S3, bucket which
is basically just a hard drive.

26
00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.660
You can run the detect
labels on it through this,

27
00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.500
or you can do it through Java,
or you can do it through Python.

28
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.410
As said before, we're going to do it
through the command line version and

29
00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.150
through the SDK for Python.

30
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.640
So first thing first, as you see here,
we need an image inside an S3 bucket.

31
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.503
So we're just going to go to the S3,
create a new bucket, and

32
00:02:20.503 --> 00:02:22.986
try to figure out a new
name that's not been taken.

33
00:02:22.986 --> 00:02:28.290
courserademo, all right,
courserademo, that works,

34
00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.604
and no it does not, okay,
courserademo0, there we go.

35
00:02:33.604 --> 00:02:37.254
And you can set that one up,
let's click Next,

36
00:02:37.254 --> 00:02:42.170
click through everything, and
you can see I click into this.

37
00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:43.700
And I'm going to upload a new image, so

38
00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.950
we're just going to grab
that off Google Images.

39
00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.036
So for this, we'll just try a hot dog or

40
00:02:50.036 --> 00:02:55.460
something, so hot dog, and Google Images.

41
00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.250
Yeah, that one looks good and
delicious, so

42
00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.850
we're just going to grab that,
download it here.

43
00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.108
As you can see here, we've tried it before
with banana, but you can just ignore that.

44
00:03:05.108 --> 00:03:10.880
Hot dog, [COUGH]
and now we have a hot dog,

45
00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.780
so just jump back to the S3 and
upload that hot dog.

46
00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:22.087
That is somewhere else, so we wanted
this one, and here's our hot dog.

47
00:03:22.087 --> 00:03:28.510
And this is a quick part of S3 demo,
and just uploading to it.

48
00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.915
So now we have a hot dog and
a bucket that we can access.

49
00:03:31.915 --> 00:03:35.350
So if we just go back to
the instructions that they give us,

50
00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.560
we can just copy this command.

51
00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.630
We do want to edit some parts of this, for
example, the region and the profile user.

52
00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.070
So we want to just go into a text editor,
and just any general one.

53
00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:53.454
I'm on Ubuntu, so this one is GEdit,
but if you're on any other system,

54
00:03:53.454 --> 00:03:54.960
just use the native one.

55
00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.058
I know Windows has Notepad, and

56
00:03:58.058 --> 00:04:03.012
I think Apple has Codex or something,
>> I'm not too sure myself.

57
00:04:03.012 --> 00:04:06.670
>> Xcode, but I'm sure they have
their own basic text editor.

58
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.850
So you can just copy this
to change the command, and

59
00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:16.180
you want to change the bucket
name to whatever bucket we set.

60
00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.851
So if we go here,
you can see that our bucket name is

61
00:04:20.851 --> 00:04:25.203
couserademo0, so
we just change it to that.

62
00:04:25.203 --> 00:04:28.460
And then we want to change
whatever image we're going to do.

63
00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:34.260
So this time, we want to do hot dog,
and the next part is, what region?

64
00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.956
So we are currently in US region west,

65
00:04:37.956 --> 00:04:43.800
I think you can check through,
we can check up here.

66
00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.930
Region US west two, so
you can change it from there.

67
00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.810
So we just want to change
this to US west two,

68
00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.190
to reflect where we actually
are adding the bucket.

69
00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.117
And then we are going to use the default
one we just used to configure our

70
00:04:58.117 --> 00:05:01.770
credentials, we just used
AWS configure for the CLI.

71
00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:07.370
And you use the default one, and
I did not spell default right, my.

72
00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:15.613
Yeah, so just Ctrl+A and
copy all that, go into command line,

73
00:05:15.613 --> 00:05:22.094
and then I used a virtual environment for
installing the Python SDK,

74
00:05:22.094 --> 00:05:27.260
so in this instance,
I'm going to go and activate that.

75
00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:35.142
And let's go to this and go to Coursera,

76
00:05:35.142 --> 00:05:38.857
and I'm going to do source.

77
00:05:38.857 --> 00:05:45.350
If this is strange, you can look up more
about virtual environments and Python.

78
00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:51.581
This is useful for having some
certain packages in one place only.

79
00:05:51.581 --> 00:05:56.580
So yeah, if we run this,
it should work, crossing my fingers.

80
00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:04.040
Yeah, and then it returned
a JSON data about what it sees.

81
00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:08.557
[COUGH] So the first thing it thinks is
that it's 99% confident that it's food,

82
00:06:08.557 --> 00:06:12.000
and also 99% confident
that it's a hot dog.

83
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.960
And something about rotation,
and that it's rotated, 0.

84
00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.275
You can look more into that, but yeah,

85
00:06:18.275 --> 00:06:22.800
this gives you the ability
just to see basic objects.

86
00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:27.108
So next we're going to try it more
programmatically through Python.

87
00:06:27.108 --> 00:06:32.510
because command line might not be as
useful for most people in applications.

88
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:39.100
So for Python, we can easily just go
back here, and ignore the Java one.

89
00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:41.814
If you want to do the Java one,
you can, it's here, so

90
00:06:41.814 --> 00:06:44.064
you can see here the many
packages involved.

91
00:06:44.064 --> 00:06:48.672
The Python one's a little smaller, and so

92
00:06:48.672 --> 00:06:54.826
we're going to just go in here and
make a new file, whoops,

93
00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:01.815
And just copy all that, and
we're going to save this as rekog.py,

94
00:07:01.815 --> 00:07:06.169
and we're saving it in this
folder that we've been using.

95
00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:15.240
So as you can see here, here's the basic
file, this file name's used, where is it?

96
00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:20.910
Yeah, it's just used here
in the s3bucket object, so

97
00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:23.964
we just want to change this and
put hot dog.

98
00:07:23.964 --> 00:07:27.845
And our Coursera thing, couserademo0,

99
00:07:27.845 --> 00:07:32.490
so just save that,
now if we actually go into that,

100
00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:43.235
And we do python rekognition, Yeah,

101
00:07:43.235 --> 00:07:49.160
there we go, [COUGH] it did the same
thing, but it did a smaller thing.

102
00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:51.330
And from here,
you can actually use it in other,

103
00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:57.510
you just stick it in other Python scripts
and programs, and do other things with it.

104
00:07:57.510 --> 00:08:01.990
Maybe just if you really don't
want hotdogs in your food or

105
00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:07.130
near you, just have a camera that checks
constantly whether it sees a hot dog or

106
00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:11.670
not, and roast that hot dog if you see it,
or something.

107
00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:17.380
So one thing to note is that
I am using the Amazon SDK,

108
00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:21.530
you can follow their instructions for
installing that.

109
00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:27.442
It's a pretty simple PIP
command [INAUDIBLE].

110
00:08:27.442 --> 00:08:35.500
So yeah, that's the demo of Amazon
Rekognition, and letting you see images.

111
00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:39.261
So stay tuned while we do the rest
of our [COUGH] AI services
