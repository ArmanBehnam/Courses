00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:05.890
Hello! So, we're going to continue going over

2
00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:10.780
some AWS projects and our next one is going to be focused on Polly.

3
00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:18.735
So, let's go onto the overview slide to see what we're doing.

4
00:00:18.735 --> 00:00:24.330
So first, we're going to describe the service that is Polly and then we're

5
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.815
going to show how to use Polly through Python, using two examples.

6
00:00:29.815 --> 00:00:33.730
The first one would be using Polly with different phrases,

7
00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:39.270
and then the second one would be using Polly with two distinct speakers.

8
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.460
Let's just go to my computer.

9
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.610
So here we have Amazon Polly and basically it

10
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.285
just turns text into life-like speech using deep learning.

11
00:00:48.285 --> 00:00:50.910
So, I might be a little bit better than some of

12
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.560
the synthesizers you guys have used before,

13
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.605
maybe some low or very robotic.

14
00:00:56.605 --> 00:00:59.990
I remember in the past using one that's just not

15
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:03.950
life-like or human at all but it just gets the job done.

16
00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.680
The benefit of this one is, you can use it as a service.

17
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.272
You just give Amazon some text and then it will just

18
00:01:10.272 --> 00:01:14.265
hand back an MP3 file with audio said.

19
00:01:14.265 --> 00:01:16.295
And you can do it in different languages,

20
00:01:16.295 --> 00:01:18.575
English, Danish, Spanish, Japanese.

21
00:01:18.575 --> 00:01:22.100
And even different voices, female,

22
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.750
male, or just different people that they've had.

23
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.416
If you want to use Amazon Polly just for a record test,

24
00:01:29.416 --> 00:01:31.535
you can go to the console and go here,

25
00:01:31.535 --> 00:01:33.205
and then just run one of these.

26
00:01:33.205 --> 00:01:35.150
Hi, my name is Joanna.

27
00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:40.200
Yeah. So, you can just choose different people to test it out and different languages.

28
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.540
Even let's say, Japanese,

29
00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.970
like they had. Whatever that says.

30
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.690
Konnichiwa. Mizuki desu.

31
00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.500
Yeah, stuff like that.

32
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.950
Using this way to synthesize is useful.

33
00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.280
But say, you're in a project because we can't really like go into this.

34
00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.280
But they do have a API for it,

35
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.040
so we can use their STK and access it that way.

36
00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.741
So, you see here we can vim into we have this program called Polly,

37
00:02:15.741 --> 00:02:20.270
and here's the other recognition program we used before.

38
00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:26.395
Here, it's just the Python file that they gave us to use starting.

39
00:02:26.395 --> 00:02:28.280
So just adding some parts.

40
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.245
Like we edited this part to say different things like, "Hello, everyone."

41
00:02:33.245 --> 00:02:37.105
And you can choose which voice person you want.

42
00:02:37.105 --> 00:02:38.505
We'll change them in a bit.

43
00:02:38.505 --> 00:02:40.430
But for now we just run it.

44
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.705
So here, we request from Amazon the MP3 file,

45
00:02:45.705 --> 00:02:52.895
and then here, we save it in our temporary directory.

46
00:02:52.895 --> 00:02:59.380
And last part is just executing or running that sound file

47
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:05.955
through the system's default MP3 player.

48
00:03:05.955 --> 00:03:09.040
So, just go there and just run this.

49
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.000
Hello, everyone.

50
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.070
How has your day been?

51
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:18.550
No, it's a bit robotic-ish, but not bad.

52
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.767
So, if you want change it with people, as before,

53
00:03:20.767 --> 00:03:25.800
you just go over here and change Salli,

54
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.200
and like one who's Brian.

55
00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.800
If not, it would just give me an error.

56
00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.210
Just tell me which option's there.

57
00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:34.850
Hello, everyone.

58
00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:36.340
How has your day been?

59
00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.564
Yeah. I think, British accent?

60
00:03:39.564 --> 00:03:39.686
Yeah, I think it's a British accent.

61
00:03:39.686 --> 00:03:43.310
Yeah, you can do the different accents

62
00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.143
because they'll sound more better or if you like that accent.

63
00:03:47.143 --> 00:03:53.770
It's really easy just to change what it is. Let's see, how has your day been.

64
00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:59.765
Let me just make it say like,

65
00:03:59.765 --> 00:04:01.010
I like apple or something.

66
00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:10.070
Or stop, intruder, and drop your stuff.

67
00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:14.514
I see you.

68
00:04:14.514 --> 00:04:17.750
Yeah, let's say for

69
00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.230
like the home surveillance project you might want to add this on or something.

70
00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:23.440
Stop, intruder, and drop your stuff. I see you.

71
00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.540
Yeah. It will just be a little creepy for

72
00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.550
the intruder and some sudden voice talking to them.

73
00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.015
Or, you can make a welcoming for someone at your door,

74
00:04:32.015 --> 00:04:33.590
instead of a doorbell.

75
00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.162
I don't think it will be welcoming, to be honest.

76
00:04:36.162 --> 00:04:38.920
If you just have it on loud blasting speakers.

77
00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.926
It will be very sudden and creepy, okay.

78
00:04:40.926 --> 00:04:43.340
Or how to talk to your dog or something.

79
00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.120
So, you don't really exit and save the file here.

80
00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.865
It actually saves it in a temporary directory.

81
00:04:48.865 --> 00:04:52.425
You can change that in the program itself

82
00:04:52.425 --> 00:04:57.420
because the program itself is saving it like in a CD.

83
00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:00.675
Yeah, there it is, speech dot MP3, that's where it saves it.

84
00:05:00.675 --> 00:05:03.235
Say, if you wanted to get it and use this for another program,

85
00:05:03.235 --> 00:05:04.890
you can just save it here and then,

86
00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:06.744
just grab the file, open it.

87
00:05:06.744 --> 00:05:09.645
So, that was Amazon Polly,

88
00:05:09.645 --> 00:05:12.275
and you can use it.

89
00:05:12.275 --> 00:05:14.505
Try to use it in some of your projects.

90
00:05:14.505 --> 00:05:16.560
Make it more interesting and life-like.

91
00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.000
So, yep, stay tuned for some other services.
