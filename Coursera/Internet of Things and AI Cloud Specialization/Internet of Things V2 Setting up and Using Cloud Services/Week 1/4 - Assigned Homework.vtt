00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.185
Congratulations everyone.

2
00:00:02.185 --> 00:00:04.531
You've made it to the end of lesson one,

3
00:00:04.531 --> 00:00:08.180
which is The Introduction to Cloud.

4
00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:10.830
So, we're just going to use some assigned homework to do,

5
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.495
so that you can do some reading and understand it in more in-depth level.

6
00:00:15.495 --> 00:00:18.220
So the first thing that you do is look up Virtual Machines,

7
00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.110
and read about them in our resources.

8
00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.980
So we'll give you links to specific pages that we want you to look into.

9
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.550
And then after that, we want you to check out the other cloud services.

10
00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:33.123
So, I know we've chosen Amazon Web Services as our main tool to teach cloud services,

11
00:00:33.123 --> 00:00:37.710
but there are other platforms out there such as Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud.

12
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.720
They offer a few slightly different services that Amazon doesn't have.

13
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.935
So you want to check them out, see what they offer,

14
00:00:44.935 --> 00:00:47.380
and just so that you know what's out there,

15
00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.435
and what can be done with the cloud so far.

16
00:00:49.435 --> 00:00:54.470
And after that, we want you to create your own EC2 Instance as we've shown earlier.

17
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:55.705
So just follow through with that,

18
00:00:55.705 --> 00:00:57.195
and just create it,

19
00:00:57.195 --> 00:00:59.590
SSH in to it, do a couple of things,

20
00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.890
maybe make a program and then SSH out,

21
00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.845
and then delete the instance,

22
00:01:05.845 --> 00:01:07.835
or stop it, either one.

23
00:01:07.835 --> 00:01:09.610
And after you do all that,

24
00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.000
please come back, to continue learning about the cloud.
