00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.287
Congratulations, everyone, you finished
lesson three of module one and

2
00:00:04.287 --> 00:00:06.972
now we want to get to you
some assigned homeworks so

3
00:00:06.972 --> 00:00:10.356
you can learn more about
the topics we've discussed so far.

4
00:00:10.356 --> 00:00:14.699
So the first thing I want you to do
is read about the REST API's and

5
00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:18.491
then after that write some JSON and
then write some XML.

6
00:00:18.491 --> 00:00:21.994
The next three parts we want
you to do are play with

7
00:00:21.994 --> 00:00:25.935
the GroupKt Countries API
that Gonz was playing with.

8
00:00:25.935 --> 00:00:31.510
And then after that,
read about MQTT and read about AWS IoT.

9
00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:34.190
Again, these readings will be
provided in the resources section.

10
00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.830
So just go in there, look for the correct
title, and then click on the link and

11
00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:38.939
just go through the readings.

12
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.890
So after you go through all this homework,
you'll have a better understanding of how

13
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.820
this IoT SDK and
how the communication protocols work.

14
00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.660
And you can start creating your
own projects using these services.
