1
00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.480
In this lesson we're going to show you how
to get setup with Amazon Web Services,

2
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.150
AWS for short.

3
00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:13.820
going to show you how to sign up for an
account, set up users, policies and keys.

4
00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.540
So the key things
are going to be permissions,

5
00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:21.520
how to download key pairs, and
show you a little bit of the SDK.

6
00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.078
So it's going to be mostly hands-on.

7
00:00:23.078 --> 00:00:26.750
We're going to walk you,
screen cast the entire process.

8
00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.270
Sergio Luna here is going to
walk you through this.

9
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.800
So it'll help If you sign up for
an account and

10
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.110
then follow along with this lesson.

11
00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.710
Having said that,
I'll let Sergio take it from here,

12
00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.480
we're going to switch to the web now.

13
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.620
>> Okay, so
the first thing you're going to

14
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.250
want to do is create your account.

15
00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.162
It's important to know that you're
going to need a credit card and

16
00:00:48.162 --> 00:00:49.885
the free tier is only 12 months long.

17
00:00:49.885 --> 00:00:50.665
So after 12 months,

18
00:00:50.665 --> 00:00:54.270
they're going to start charging you if
you're currently using their services.

19
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.490
When you click Create Account, you're
going to come to this page right here.

20
00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:01.880
Where you're going to enter your account
name, your email, and a password.

21
00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.280
Once you hit Continue, it'll go to
this next page where, initially,

22
00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.710
it's going to be on Company Account.

23
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.130
You're probably going to want a personal
account, because this just for

24
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.480
your own personal use.

25
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.990
You fill out all this information,
and then you fill

26
00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.500
out the credit card info on the next page
and you are going to be ready to go.

27
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.520
It's important to note also that you are
probably going to want to set up a billing

28
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:28.430
alarm just in case you go over
the free tier's alloted services.

29
00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.738
Say you have an EC2 instance and
It's being used too much,

30
00:01:31.738 --> 00:01:35.587
or you have a size that's too big, so
you're going to want to know that.

31
00:01:35.587 --> 00:01:40.168
And you can set up billing alarms so
that Amazon emails you or

32
00:01:40.168 --> 00:01:45.124
notifies you however you want to so
you can cancel it right away.

33
00:01:45.124 --> 00:01:47.235
>> We know there's a free
tier account in the US.

34
00:01:47.235 --> 00:01:51.485
But if some of you are watching
from China, India, Brazil or

35
00:01:51.485 --> 00:01:55.045
any other country I'm sure there
is some free tier for you guys.

36
00:01:56.482 --> 00:01:59.032
See if not, just post on the board,
see what you can do.

37
00:01:59.032 --> 00:02:02.964
But you can also use other cloud services,
like Microsoft or

38
00:02:02.964 --> 00:02:05.057
Google as I mentioned earlier.

39
00:02:05.057 --> 00:02:08.552
But we chose Amazon because it was
the most popular service out there.

40
00:02:10.692 --> 00:02:13.297
>> And now, you're going to be on
the home page after you log in.

41
00:02:13.297 --> 00:02:16.448
And the first thing you're going to
want to look at are user roles and

42
00:02:16.448 --> 00:02:18.512
policies that you can create.

43
00:02:18.512 --> 00:02:20.800
You can click up here on Services.

44
00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.432
And down here which is a security identity
and compliance, you can click on IAM.

45
00:02:26.432 --> 00:02:28.652
And here is where you can create users, so

46
00:02:28.652 --> 00:02:31.330
that you can collaborate
with other people.

47
00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.588
When you're logged in, as now, you're
the root account, you own this account.

48
00:02:35.588 --> 00:02:38.274
And you can create users who can view and

49
00:02:38.274 --> 00:02:41.458
use your services as much
as you allow them to.

50
00:02:41.458 --> 00:02:45.060
You create policies that denote how
much they're allowed to use it.

51
00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.570
To create one, you just go right here
on this tab where it says Users, and

52
00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.720
up top you would add a user.

53
00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.870
Create the user name, and it's going to
flow through Permissions, you're

54
00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.530
going to review, and it's going to say do
you want to create the password for them?

55
00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.480
Do you want them to write
their own password?

56
00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.617
Give us their email.

57
00:03:03.617 --> 00:03:09.610
Information like that and then you're
going to end up with a user, like this.

58
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.420
You would have already created
some permissions for them but

59
00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.850
you can also go back in and
edit them whenever you want.

60
00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.260
So you would just come in to where
it says Users, click on your user,

61
00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.990
the user your created.

62
00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:24.232
And then in the permissions tab
you can go to Add Permissions.

63
00:03:24.232 --> 00:03:27.082
You're going to want to look at
existing policies directly because

64
00:03:27.082 --> 00:03:29.210
those are policies that Amazon writes for
you.

65
00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:32.710
You don't have to worry about
coding it exactly as they want it.

66
00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:37.810
So let's say you wanted to give
this user EC2 instant services.

67
00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.950
You will type in EC2/ right here
in the search bar, look for

68
00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.500
Amazon EC2 Full Access.

69
00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.570
Click on it and you just continue
through here, you add permissions.

70
00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.770
And there you go, now this user's
allowed to create, edit, and

71
00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:55.860
do anything that EC2 is allowed to do.

72
00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.974
And it's important to note that when
you give a user access like this,

73
00:03:59.974 --> 00:04:02.917
it's going to allow them
to use your credit card.

74
00:04:02.917 --> 00:04:04.726
So they can create instances and

75
00:04:04.726 --> 00:04:08.880
maybe they're going to create one
that's not allotted in the free tier.

76
00:04:10.512 --> 00:04:12.170
It's going to be all on your information,

77
00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.320
your credit card is used even
though it's their user account.

78
00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:17.470
From there,

79
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:23.320
once you have a user if you want to be
able to use AWS Client in a terminal.

80
00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.530
What you would want to do is,
first setup what are called access keys.

81
00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.510
There's an access key,
a public one and a private one.

82
00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.220
It's very important to note that
you can only download this once.

83
00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.750
Once you've downloaded it,
you can't download it again.

84
00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.950
So I recommend backing it up more than
once, backing it up onto a device and

85
00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:43.990
then onto a different device,
just in case you lose it.

86
00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.200
The way you would do that is once again,
you go to the,

87
00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.490
actually you can come up here,
where your username is.

88
00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.020
Go to my security credentials.

89
00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.080
You can skip this.

90
00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.210
And where it says access keys, right here,
you're going to want to click on that and

91
00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:00.690
say create new access key.

92
00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.680
It's going to tell you
download this file now and

93
00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.410
you're not going to be
able to download it again.

94
00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:08.070
So go ahead and download it and
there's the access key.

95
00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:13.680
If you want to take a look at what it
looks like, it's just a comma separated.

96
00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.490
It's going to show you your access
key right here, this one's public.

97
00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:19.530
You can find this on
Amazon on your account.

98
00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:22.430
But down here, the secret key,
only you have this.

99
00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:24.220
That's why you want to back this up and

100
00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:27.980
download it to a couple of secure
devices so that you don't ever lose it.

101
00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:32.254
And if it were the case that you do
lose it, you can always come in here and

102
00:05:32.254 --> 00:05:36.406
make an active on one of your older
keys that you're no longer using.

103
00:05:36.406 --> 00:05:39.240
Or that you forgot the information for.

104
00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.240
And once it's inactive,
you can no longer use it.

105
00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.520
The reason you have to make one inactive
is because you're only allowed to have two

106
00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.660
at a time,
that's the max you can ever have.

107
00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:51.165
And if you need another one,
the only option you have is to delete

108
00:05:51.165 --> 00:05:54.005
one of your older ones and
create one of the newer ones.

109
00:05:54.005 --> 00:05:56.435
So now using your AWS access key

110
00:05:57.435 --> 00:06:02.365
you can download the AWS
client onto your terminal.

111
00:06:02.365 --> 00:06:10.481
To do that on Ubuntu it's pseudo
app get install aws play.

112
00:06:10.481 --> 00:06:11.982
Hit downloads, go ahead and say yes.

113
00:06:16.615 --> 00:06:20.360
And while that's downloading
you can go ahead and copy and

114
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:24.660
paste your values because we're
going to need those right now.

115
00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:29.600
Okay, so now you have AWS and
you're going to want to run AWS Configure.

116
00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:33.460
So it's going to ask you right here,
what is your access key?

117
00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:34.960
Go ahead and paste that one in.

118
00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:38.280
And then it's going to ask you,
well what's your secret key?

119
00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.827
So we're going to copy that.

120
00:06:43.263 --> 00:06:47.540
And paste that one in, then it's going to
ask you what region you want to use.

121
00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:50.865
We're going to go ahead and use US West 1.

122
00:06:50.865 --> 00:06:53.250
And then it's going to ask
you the output format.

123
00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:55.990
I recommend you use JSON,
because it's the easiest to work with.

124
00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.640
>> So for regions,
people in other countries,

125
00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:01.390
where do they find their
available regions?

126
00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:05.932
>> You can Google AWS regions And

127
00:07:05.932 --> 00:07:10.660
it'll show you a list of everything
that they have right here.

128
00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:15.760
These regions are the denoted in your
account when you look up to the top right.

129
00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:18.820
Let's say I want to go into a service,
it's not important.

130
00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:21.090
Up here is the region that
you're currently working in.

131
00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:27.980
So we're in US West,
which happens to be US West 1, right here.

132
00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:34.632
And once you've done that for
your AWS client you can use

133
00:07:34.632 --> 00:07:37.320
any of the services that they have, like-
>> You

134
00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:38.005
may want to increase your screen size.

135
00:07:38.005 --> 00:07:38.518
>> Yeah.

136
00:07:38.518 --> 00:07:39.897
>> Control plus, there you go.

137
00:07:43.345 --> 00:07:47.100
You run AWS S3, so
you want to list what you have.

138
00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:51.650
And it's going to show you, these
are the buckets you have for, say, S3.

139
00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:55.610
And you can just check the type of
commands you can run with AWS help.

140
00:07:55.610 --> 00:08:00.370
And it'll show you a whole list
of things you can do on here,

141
00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:03.220
and that's for the AWS client.

142
00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:06.780
So if you want to work with your AWS
account through the terminal, and

143
00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:12.260
you don't want to have to download some
third party library, you can use that.

144
00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:16.050
And the only thing aside from that,

145
00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:21.570
is if you wanted to write code for
your AWS services.

146
00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:26.700
Like let's say you want to write something
in PHP, You look for the AWS SDK for PHP.

147
00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:32.810
You go ahead and go in here, and you would
just follow the instructions on here to be

148
00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:37.790
able to write actual code that will pull
information from any of your AWS services.

149
00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:42.480
In this, you're also going to need
to supply your access keys and

150
00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:43.930
your secret key.

151
00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:45.350
It's just going to be written in code and

152
00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:47.420
you're going to want to
make sure that's secure.

153
00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:51.070
So that's how you set up AWS Client and
your users and

154
00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:54.390
the overlook at the SDKs that they have.
