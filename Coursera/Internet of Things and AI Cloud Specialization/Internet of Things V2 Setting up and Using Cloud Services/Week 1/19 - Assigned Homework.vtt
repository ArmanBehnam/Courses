00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.955
Welcome everyone to the end of lesson five about AI services.

2
00:00:03.955 --> 00:00:08.880
So, now we want to give you some assigned homework to do for this lesson.

3
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.695
So we want you to read about Rekognition,

4
00:00:12.695 --> 00:00:15.640
Lex, Polly, and the Machine Learning AMI's.

5
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.095
And even though we kind of did a brief description of all of them,

6
00:00:19.095 --> 00:00:22.800
they were pretty brief so we want you to go back to each of the web pages and

7
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.885
just kind of read over it and see how exactly they work behind the scenes.

8
00:00:27.885 --> 00:00:29.480
You don't need to get too deep understandings,

9
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.135
just a general understanding of it.

10
00:00:31.135 --> 00:00:34.784
And just for the Machine Learning AMI's specifically,

11
00:00:34.784 --> 00:00:40.230
you just want to see what AMI's are out there and kind of what each one offers.

12
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.385
Like for example, the deep learning AMI's have a lot of libraries

13
00:00:44.385 --> 00:00:49.770
or frameworks for machine learning preinstalled such as TensorFlow and Keras.

14
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.410
So, after you've played with all the services,

15
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.890
you should have a pretty good understanding of how to integrate it to your own projects.

16
00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.430
So stay tuned for seeing how we integrate some of these services

17
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.030
into our own projects and some basic projects to show.
