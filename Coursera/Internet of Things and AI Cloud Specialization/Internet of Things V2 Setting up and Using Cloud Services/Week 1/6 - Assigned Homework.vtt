Hello everyone, now that we've
kind of walked you through how to

2
00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:07.310
create an account, and
set up your IM users, and

3
00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:10.490
install the AWSTLI,
we want you to actually do it yourselves.

4
00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:12.960
So, we're just going to give you a quick

5
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.310
assignment list of what you should
get done by the end of this lesson.

6
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.740
So we'll just start off with

7
00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.400
the first task that's written
down is create an AWS account.

8
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.060
Make sure you get free tier,
remember this is for 12 months free, so

9
00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.200
you do kind of have a ticking
clock once you create it.

10
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.120
After that, you'll want to create
an IAM user with Admin Access, so

11
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:42.240
that it can access everything on
the console or on AWS that you have.

12
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.310
You can create other IAM users for limited
access to some other services but for

13
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:51.560
now just create IAM user with admin
access and save these API keys.

14
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.930
Next you want to install the AWS CLI and

15
00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.060
configure it using the correct API keys
that you've gotten with your IAM user.

16
00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.600
And then you'll also want to choose
the correct region that's best for you.

17
00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:05.160
So after you do all that,

18
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.270
we can actually continue to build
more interesting projects with AWS.
