00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.530
In this lesson, we're going to talk about how to set up

2
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.735
some of the core EC2 Services, AWS Services.

3
00:00:07.735 --> 00:00:14.460
In particular we going to cover how to launch EC2 Instance virtual machine,

4
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.510
and also set up what's called a LAMP stack,

5
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.815
Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP.

6
00:00:20.815 --> 00:00:24.390
We will set up an Apache Web Server,

7
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.415
also set up a MySQL Database along with PHP what's called a middleware,

8
00:00:29.415 --> 00:00:32.890
which sits between your HTML and Database.

9
00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.975
And all these are pretty easy to configure.

10
00:00:35.975 --> 00:00:40.230
However, we won't dive into depth to any of these topics,

11
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.930
we won't cover Database, or PHP, MySQL.

12
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.820
However, what we want to show is how to spin off an Instance which machine of

13
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.135
these pretty quickly and set up REST API using PHP.

14
00:00:54.135 --> 00:00:58.190
On that note, I'll hand it of to Sergio who'll kind of walk through the steps.

15
00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.215
I'll switch the slides here.

16
00:01:02.215 --> 00:01:07.435
As Gan said, the first thing we're going to do is set up our EC2 Instance.

17
00:01:07.435 --> 00:01:09.779
And to do that, we need to download a key pair.

18
00:01:09.779 --> 00:01:13.060
The key pair acts as a password so that only you or

19
00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.080
anyone who has that key pair can log in to your EC2 Instance via SSH.

20
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.110
Then we're going to actually configure and launch an Instance.

21
00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:21.745
Then we want to associate an IP address,

22
00:01:21.745 --> 00:01:24.160
because we're going to set it up as a website and we

23
00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.668
want to connect to it through a browser,

24
00:01:26.668 --> 00:01:28.465
and to do that we need an IP address.

25
00:01:28.465 --> 00:01:32.095
Then after that we're actually going to connect and it will install

26
00:01:32.095 --> 00:01:36.250
the rest of Apache, MySQL, and PHP.

27
00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.060
So, if we go on over to my screen,

28
00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.275
you can see this is the homepage for when you log in to your AWS account.

29
00:01:45.275 --> 00:01:49.525
What you're going to want to do is up here you hit services and you go to EC2.

30
00:01:49.525 --> 00:01:52.535
The first thing, like we said is to create a key pair.

31
00:01:52.535 --> 00:01:55.015
So right here, on the EC2 dashboard,

32
00:01:55.015 --> 00:01:58.630
you click on key pairs and you go ahead and just create one.

33
00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.240
Name it anything you want.

34
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.980
You could probably name it the name of your application.

35
00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.020
And what's very important to note is that,

36
00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.280
when you create it it's a lot like the access key for your AWS account.

37
00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.765
You can only download it once,

38
00:02:10.765 --> 00:02:13.891
and once you've downloaded it that's going to be stored.

39
00:02:13.891 --> 00:02:18.560
You want to back it up probably more than once just for safety.

40
00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.873
So you get a key pair for your account and a key pair for EC2?

41
00:02:21.873 --> 00:02:23.080
Yeah. For each EC2.

42
00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.260
And you can use the same key pair for different servers for an EC2.

43
00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.670
And it's also important that when you download it,

44
00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.580
it automatically takes the file permissions that

45
00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.310
your desktop or whatever machine you're currently running sets it to.

46
00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:38.770
And Amazon doesn't want that.

47
00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.700
Amazon wants it to be a very specific set of permissions.

48
00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.655
So what you're going to do is open up your terminal,

49
00:02:45.655 --> 00:02:51.640
and go into the directory where you downloaded it, I have it right here.

50
00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.180
And you're going to want to change the permissions,

51
00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.885
you're going to write chmod.

52
00:02:56.885 --> 00:03:02.230
The specific portions that Amazon wants is 400 and then the name of your pem file.

53
00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.150
So you go ahead and hit enter and there we go.

54
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.925
Now it's ready to be used.

55
00:03:05.925 --> 00:03:10.104
The next thing we're going to want to do is actually configure and launch the Instance.

56
00:03:10.104 --> 00:03:13.715
So you're going to go ahead and go back to your EC2 dashboard,

57
00:03:13.715 --> 00:03:19.050
and you can see this big blue button says Launch Instance, go ahead and click that.

58
00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.561
And since we're on Linux, we're going to use Ubuntu right here.

59
00:03:22.561 --> 00:03:24.370
You click that select.

60
00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.490
Okay. Is it possible to go back to that screen?

61
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.760
Yeah.

62
00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.548
Okay.

63
00:03:28.548 --> 00:03:31.914
This is what I mentioned they can pick.

64
00:03:31.914 --> 00:03:34.530
Here is the screen which if you don't want Ubuntu,

65
00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.375
you want to use a Windows Instance, you can do that here.

66
00:03:37.375 --> 00:03:40.850
This is a virtual machine you choose what type of OS you want to launch here.

67
00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.070
Since we've been using Ubuntu here, we chosen Ubuntu.

68
00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:46.485
But you can see, there are all flavors of operating systems here.

69
00:03:46.485 --> 00:03:49.505
In fact, in the future you can create

70
00:03:49.505 --> 00:03:52.995
specific machine images called Amazon Machine Image,

71
00:03:52.995 --> 00:03:56.100
which has the required software installed in there.

72
00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.030
For example, you may want to create an Instance with the next Apache, MySQL,

73
00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.920
PHP preinstalled in there,

74
00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.310
and all these community images available which makes life easier for you.

75
00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.327
But here, we just launching a Core Ubuntu,

76
00:04:08.327 --> 00:04:12.940
Bear Ubuntu, and we're going to install software on top of it.

77
00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.055
So you go ahead and hit that select from the Ubuntu.

78
00:04:16.055 --> 00:04:20.565
And lucky for us the configurations we need we can use all the default.

79
00:04:20.565 --> 00:04:22.818
Everything default is going to be free to your eligible.

80
00:04:22.818 --> 00:04:26.320
So if you have that 12-month free tier you can go ahead and use that.

81
00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.900
The only thing we're going to have to change

82
00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.365
is up here number six, configure security group.

83
00:04:31.365 --> 00:04:35.480
This is basically showing you what you're allowing your server,

84
00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.035
your EC2 Instance to be connected through.

85
00:04:38.035 --> 00:04:43.230
As you can see, all we have right now is SSH which happens to be on port 22.

86
00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:45.630
We want to add HTTP because we're going to want to

87
00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.990
be accessing this through the browser and that's done through HTTP.

88
00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.645
So you go ahead and click Add Rule,

89
00:04:50.645 --> 00:04:54.593
you find HTTP and that's it.

90
00:04:54.593 --> 00:04:56.020
It's on port 80 as it should be,

91
00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.485
you can go ahead and click review launch.

92
00:04:58.485 --> 00:05:00.170
This takes you to a review page where you

93
00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:02.075
can look at everything that you might have changed.

94
00:05:02.075 --> 00:05:05.480
But for us, since our default configurations are perfect,

95
00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:09.355
the only thing we changed was adding HTTP as a way to connect.

96
00:05:09.355 --> 00:05:11.420
And you go ahead and click launch.

97
00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:14.825
Now, right here it's going to ask you what key pair do you want to use?

98
00:05:14.825 --> 00:05:17.270
If you hadn't created one up until this point,

99
00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.270
you can create one right here and download it from here.

100
00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:21.440
But since we already made one,

101
00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.177
we're going to go ahead and use that one.

102
00:05:23.177 --> 00:05:24.740
So myapplication.

103
00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.640
And it asks you to acknowledge that you already have this because if you don't have this,

104
00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:32.475
you're not able to log in to your EC2 Instance at all.

105
00:05:32.475 --> 00:05:34.245
And you go ahead and click launch.

106
00:05:34.245 --> 00:05:36.910
Now, you can go back to view instances,

107
00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:38.268
and you see that it's pending.

108
00:05:38.268 --> 00:05:39.790
It's currently initializing.

109
00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:41.080
While it's doing that,

110
00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.000
we're going to associate an IP address with this because we want to connect to a browser,

111
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.405
we want to have an IP address that we can connect to it with.

112
00:05:47.405 --> 00:05:49.195
So over here on the left,

113
00:05:49.195 --> 00:05:54.890
you go down to Elastic IPs in the Network and Security,

114
00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:58.070
and you allocate a new address.

115
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.605
It's as easy as just telling it to allocate.

116
00:06:00.605 --> 00:06:02.308
And there you have an IP address.

117
00:06:02.308 --> 00:06:04.220
So you go ahead and close that.

118
00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:06.645
And what you want to do with this IP address,

119
00:06:06.645 --> 00:06:10.780
is you want to click actions and associate it.

120
00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:13.410
You want to associate it with an Instance,

121
00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:16.805
being the Instance we just created that would be this one.

122
00:06:16.805 --> 00:06:20.365
And you want to associate it to that Instance as private IP,

123
00:06:20.365 --> 00:06:22.135
and there's only going to be one right here.

124
00:06:22.135 --> 00:06:23.820
So you just go ahead and click that one,

125
00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:28.815
and you click associate and succeeded. So you can close that.

126
00:06:28.815 --> 00:06:31.755
Now, we can go back to our EC2 dashboard,

127
00:06:31.755 --> 00:06:35.246
and now you notice it says we have one running Instance.

128
00:06:35.246 --> 00:06:37.890
That means it's set up and ready to go, it's running.

129
00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:40.050
We're going to go ahead and copy this IP address,

130
00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:41.880
which is that same IP address that we just

131
00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:46.280
created so that we can actually SSH into our server.

132
00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.330
So you go ahead and open a new terminal,

133
00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:49.600
or the one you had already,

134
00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.155
and you want to type in ssh.

135
00:06:52.155 --> 00:06:57.280
And whenever you use the pem file it's -I and the name of your pem file.

136
00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:00.625
And then EC2 automatically names

137
00:07:00.625 --> 00:07:05.110
your user for the server Ubuntu if you chose the Ubuntu AMI.

138
00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:08.110
If you chose the Amazon AMI,

139
00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:10.130
it would be EC2 user.

140
00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:12.580
And if you chose the Red Hat one it's another one I think

141
00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:15.130
it's redhat@ and then your IP address.

142
00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:20.480
For us, we're going to type ubuntu@ and then our IP address that we were just given.

143
00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:24.570
Go ahead and click enter, you say yes.

144
00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:32.360
Oh, it denied us because the chmod didn't go through. One second.

145
00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:38.425
We're going to add IP address.

146
00:07:38.425 --> 00:07:40.575
And there we go. We're in.

147
00:07:40.575 --> 00:07:42.561
Now that we're in,

148
00:07:42.561 --> 00:07:46.095
we've completed the Linux portion of our installation.

149
00:07:46.095 --> 00:07:49.995
So we have the server running Linux and it's ready to go.

150
00:07:49.995 --> 00:07:53.940
The next thing would be to install Apache, MySQL and PHP.

151
00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:55.890
You may want to show them one since you're in

152
00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:58.095
the command window like you're inside the virtual machine.

153
00:07:58.095 --> 00:08:00.650
right now you can glimpse it on them.

154
00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:03.675
Oh yeah you can look, this is clearly not my machine.

155
00:08:03.675 --> 00:08:08.175
It shows right here you're logged in as Ubuntu at IP 172.

156
00:08:08.175 --> 00:08:12.165
This is the private IP that your instance has created for you.

157
00:08:12.165 --> 00:08:15.480
If you look at everything in here you can see that we're in

158
00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:22.440
Ubuntu terminal and it's completely blank right now. There's nothing in here.

159
00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:25.431
And what we want to do is install Apache2,

160
00:08:25.431 --> 00:08:30.990
MySQL and PHP but before we do that we want to run apt get update.

161
00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:33.615
If we don't run this so we forget to do this,

162
00:08:33.615 --> 00:08:38.310
some of the PHP installation is going to fail because it's not up to

163
00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:41.280
date and that's an issue that needs to be fixed but for now

164
00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:45.025
as long as you do apt update it's going to be fine.

165
00:08:45.025 --> 00:08:46.730
The first thing we do is Apache.

166
00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:52.425
So that would be sudo apt get install Apache2.

167
00:08:52.425 --> 00:08:57.525
You're going to get that, you go ahead and say yes and it begins installing.

168
00:08:57.525 --> 00:09:01.500
What it's doing now is installing all the configuration files and

169
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:06.655
setting everything up so that you can connect via HTTP.

170
00:09:06.655 --> 00:09:12.038
It's already set to go and if you want to test this you can already go into a browser,

171
00:09:12.038 --> 00:09:15.510
type in your IP address and look at it run.

172
00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:18.750
I highly recommend that you read this page because it

173
00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:21.885
gives you a lot of information about how Apache works.

174
00:09:21.885 --> 00:09:24.570
For example if I just typed in an IP address,

175
00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:26.880
at first you may not know,

176
00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:28.345
how does it know to go here,

177
00:09:28.345 --> 00:09:30.235
where's all this coming from.

178
00:09:30.235 --> 00:09:37.350
If you read this you'll see that this file is located at var/ww/html/index.

179
00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:41.380
So if we go into our terminal and look at that directory,

180
00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:46.015
var/ww/html we see the index file.

181
00:09:46.015 --> 00:09:51.840
You can look at that index file and if you were to make any changes in this file,

182
00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:55.295
those changes would be shown on your website over here.

183
00:09:55.295 --> 00:09:56.920
So I do highly recommend you read this.

184
00:09:56.920 --> 00:10:00.455
It's very important to know.

185
00:10:00.455 --> 00:10:02.220
Now, that's it for Apache.

186
00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:06.345
It's all set up to run and host off of this directory.

187
00:10:06.345 --> 00:10:10.490
And what we want to install next is the MySQL server.

188
00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:11.970
That's also a simple install.

189
00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:18.630
You just do sudo apt get install MySQL dash server.

190
00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:22.385
You go in and say yes and it's going to ask you for a password.

191
00:10:22.385 --> 00:10:25.935
You want to set up an account for this user, for this MySQL.

192
00:10:25.935 --> 00:10:29.175
The default is root and that's going to be obviously the root user.

193
00:10:29.175 --> 00:10:31.275
So go ahead and type in a password.

194
00:10:31.275 --> 00:10:33.564
It's going to ask you to repeat it,

195
00:10:33.564 --> 00:10:34.935
and there we go.

196
00:10:34.935 --> 00:10:40.153
It's unpacking and setting everything up.

197
00:10:40.153 --> 00:10:48.505
Once it's done we'll go ahead and log in.

198
00:10:48.505 --> 00:10:54.445
We can test that it's working fine by logging in using the command MySQL dash U.

199
00:10:54.445 --> 00:10:56.700
Dash U is denoting which user you want to use.

200
00:10:56.700 --> 00:11:00.880
We're going to go ahead and use root and then dash P. Now you could type in whatever

201
00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:03.370
your password was right here but it's not

202
00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:06.435
typically not a good idea to write your password in the terminal.

203
00:11:06.435 --> 00:11:10.195
So you just write dash P and then it prompt you for your password,

204
00:11:10.195 --> 00:11:11.875
and you type that.

205
00:11:11.875 --> 00:11:14.725
Now you're logged into MySQL secure and you would use

206
00:11:14.725 --> 00:11:21.340
regular SQL query language to parse through your databases.

207
00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:24.340
It shows that we have those. And this is just

208
00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:27.550
to show that MySQL is functioning properly on our server.

209
00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:31.060
So now from the lamp stack we have the Linux server

210
00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:34.400
running and we have Apache and MySQL installed.

211
00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:36.380
The next thing to do is to install PHP.

212
00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:40.020
Now, if you want to use PHP with Apache,

213
00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:44.620
there are certain configurations that you have to change in your Apache file and

214
00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:50.270
that's located in etc/apache2/apache2conf.

215
00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:52.900
But luckily if you install it the way we're about to install it,

216
00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:54.675
you don't have to do any of that.

217
00:11:54.675 --> 00:12:00.190
All you have to do is sudo apt get install PHP.

218
00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:03.130
That's going to start PHP, the latest version of PHP.

219
00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:06.080
And now what I was talking about where you

220
00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:09.085
won't have to go into the Apache configuration files,

221
00:12:09.085 --> 00:12:17.865
you just type libapache2-mod-php and PHP mcrypt.

222
00:12:17.865 --> 00:12:21.150
These are two things that are going to set up Apache to be able

223
00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:25.320
to take in PHP files and not just plain HDMI files.

224
00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:28.470
And we also since we're going to want to use PHP with MySQL you

225
00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:32.223
also want install PHP there we go,

226
00:12:32.223 --> 00:12:40.735
PHP crypt script and

227
00:12:40.735 --> 00:12:46.985
you also want to install PHP MySQL because we're going to want to use MySQL through PHP.

228
00:12:46.985 --> 00:12:50.270
You want to go ahead and say yes all this and let it install.

229
00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:54.785
What it's doing is automatically going through the Apache configuration files

230
00:12:54.785 --> 00:13:01.585
and inserting some lines that say PHP is okay to use for our purposes.

231
00:13:01.585 --> 00:13:07.110
And there we go. And that's it for installing lamp.

232
00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:08.840
Now you have Linux Apache, MySQL and PHP.

233
00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:16.360
If you wanted to say create a new file or a new link on your website,

234
00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:18.915
say you want to do info.php.

235
00:13:18.915 --> 00:13:21.390
Currently it's not found because it doesn't exist.

236
00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:23.775
The way you do that is go into this directory var/ww/html

237
00:13:23.775 --> 00:13:28.005
and that's where Apache is saving your file and

238
00:13:28.005 --> 00:13:37.180
you simply create info.php and we're going to make a very simple php file.

239
00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:43.850
This command right here really is a command to test

240
00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:47.204
whether or not php is working on your machine.

241
00:13:47.204 --> 00:13:51.260
You type php.info and it's just going to output a bunch of information about PHP.

242
00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:54.030
You save that and now if you try going onto

243
00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:59.720
this website you'll see all this information on this new file that you just created.

244
00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:05.375
And one last thing to know about using Apache is that right now we're in

245
00:14:05.375 --> 00:14:08.440
a similar directory and if we wanted to

246
00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:11.950
say create a new link so that it's not just info.php,

247
00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:14.935
say you want to be able to access some user data.

248
00:14:14.935 --> 00:14:17.545
You do users/user.

249
00:14:17.545 --> 00:14:24.310
You want to append something so that you have a directory style in your URL.

250
00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:26.890
The way you would do that is you actually make a directory called

251
00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:30.755
users in this HDMI directory.

252
00:14:30.755 --> 00:14:34.360
So now you can see that it's there but an issue with

253
00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:38.780
the Apache and is something that you should really take note of every time.

254
00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:40.731
Now that I've created this user directory,

255
00:14:40.731 --> 00:14:46.320
if I log into that link I'm going to get this really weird looking index.

256
00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:48.835
It's just a text file that shows me the directory.

257
00:14:48.835 --> 00:14:52.600
You don't want this because then you might have someone log in your website

258
00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:56.770
and be able to parse through your directories and that's typically not safe.

259
00:14:56.770 --> 00:15:01.405
So what you should do is every time you create a new directory like users,

260
00:15:01.405 --> 00:15:05.580
you want to also create a file called index in there.

261
00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:10.690
Now you can make it index.html or index.php because we have done that for all of them.

262
00:15:10.690 --> 00:15:17.120
So we're going to go ahead and call it index.php and we'll make another simple PHP file.

263
00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:19.456
This time we'll just have it say,

264
00:15:19.456 --> 00:15:24.560
this is my user's directory.

265
00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:29.370
And now if we go ahead and go back to

266
00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:32.940
this user's page it'll automatically take us to that index.php.

267
00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:35.370
This is just so that people won't be able to parse through

268
00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:39.300
your actual files and it's going to look more like a website.

269
00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:43.765
Make sure you have an index.php in every directory that you put there.

270
00:15:43.765 --> 00:15:51.000
And that kind of does it for installing lamp on an EC2 server and getting it ready to go.

271
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.330
And one last thing you want to add is you want to talk about

272
00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:56.634
parsing the virtual machine when not in use so they don't get charged for it?

273
00:15:56.634 --> 00:16:00.830
Yeah, if you have the free tier it's fine to leave going as long as you use

274
00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:05.740
that specific instance but if you don't want it to keep running,

275
00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:10.405
you're going to want to go ahead and go back into the EC2 dashboard,

276
00:16:10.405 --> 00:16:15.610
look at the one running instance you have and then this is the one right here.

277
00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:17.335
You want to do actions,

278
00:16:17.335 --> 00:16:20.545
instance state and stop.

279
00:16:20.545 --> 00:16:23.604
It's going to stop it and

280
00:16:23.604 --> 00:16:27.530
you go ahead and click yes and it's going to tell you it's stopping.

281
00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:29.015
Now, once it's stopped,

282
00:16:29.015 --> 00:16:30.790
you can start it up again.

283
00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:32.630
If you want to completely delete one of

284
00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:38.355
your instances you're going to want to hit actions state and terminate.

285
00:16:38.355 --> 00:16:41.915
That'll completely delete it and you won't be able to recover the information on there.

286
00:16:41.915 --> 00:16:44.840
It's also important to note that if you want to

287
00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:48.335
make sure you're not being charged say when you're 12 months tiers over,

288
00:16:48.335 --> 00:16:52.460
you're also going to want to go into your elastic IPs and

289
00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:57.435
since you have an IP right here you click actions and disassociate address.

290
00:16:57.435 --> 00:17:00.170
And once you've disassociated the address,

291
00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:05.450
you right click on there again on the address itself and you're going to want to click

292
00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:08.030
release address so that you're no

293
00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:11.175
longer using it and Amazon is free to use that IP address whenever they want.

294
00:17:11.175 --> 00:17:13.970
And that's how you would parse any sort

295
00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:19.395
of things that require money for your EC2 instances.

296
00:17:19.395 --> 00:17:22.870
And that just about does it for setting up EC2 instance

297
00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:26.990
with a lamp stack and creating a very simple website.
