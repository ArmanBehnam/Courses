Welcome everyone to lessons four assigned Homework video.

2
00:00:03.415 --> 00:00:09.215
And we'll just be go over the steps you need to do to the assessments for this section.

3
00:00:09.215 --> 00:00:14.525
So, we want you to read the EC2 documentation, read about Apache,

4
00:00:14.525 --> 00:00:17.530
write some MySQL code to get the hang of it a bit,

5
00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:21.542
you don't have to do something too complex just some inserts,

6
00:00:21.542 --> 00:00:24.420
updates in it and reads.

7
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.595
And then write some PHP code,

8
00:00:26.595 --> 00:00:35.315
just like some playing around with it and then we want you to read the RDS documentation,

9
00:00:35.315 --> 00:00:41.606
the S3 documentation, and lastly Read Code Commit documentation.

10
00:00:41.606 --> 00:00:43.285
For all these documentation readings,

11
00:00:43.285 --> 00:00:45.304
you don't have to read too in-depth just kind of like

12
00:00:45.304 --> 00:00:48.000
the general understanding unless you actually want to go through

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.665
the whole thing and you're really interested about this topic

14
00:00:50.665 --> 00:00:53.965
then you can read the whole thing and understand how it works.

15
00:00:53.965 --> 00:00:55.260
But for our purposes,

16
00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.285
you don't need too far in-depth.

17
00:00:57.285 --> 00:01:00.510
And after you go through all the readings,

18
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.170
we want you to play around using all the above and just getting hands on with it.

19
00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.000
After that you should have a pretty good understanding of how to use those services.
