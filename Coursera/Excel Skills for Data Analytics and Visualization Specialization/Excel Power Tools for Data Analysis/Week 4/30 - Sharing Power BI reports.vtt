[MUSIC]

2
00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:06.215
In this video,
we're going to get a quick overview

3
00:00:06.215 --> 00:00:10.491
of some of the options for sharing power.

4
00:00:10.491 --> 00:00:12.440
BI reports.

5
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.658
We've created this fantastic content, and

6
00:00:14.658 --> 00:00:17.440
chances are we want to
share it with colleagues.

7
00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.090
So what are our options?

8
00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.840
Well, in power BI desktop,
they're actually quite limited.

9
00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.780
We can share the PBIX file itself,
much like we'd share an Excel workbook.

10
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.440
And in a small organization,
this might be fine.

11
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.810
Another option we have is
we can exported to pdf.

12
00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:41.801
So if you click on your final tab and
come down to Export, there's the options.

13
00:00:41.801 --> 00:00:47.630
Export PdF and there's my exported PDF.

14
00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.411
You can see each page from the report
becomes a page in the pdf file, and

15
00:00:52.411 --> 00:00:54.540
it looks pretty good.

16
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.980
This is great if you need a snapshot,
but we cannot filter or interact with

17
00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:05.350
the data in anyway, so it is a little
bit limited coming back to my power.

18
00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:06.390
BI report.

19
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.405
If you want to give users
an interactive experience,

20
00:01:10.405 --> 00:01:16.340
probably your best bet is going to be
to publish it to the power BI service.

21
00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.340
And that's what we're
going to look at next.

22
00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:19.611
But before we published,

23
00:01:19.611 --> 00:01:23.240
I'd like you to see what the power
BI service actually looks like.

24
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.189
So if you like to do this, come to your
browser and you're going to need to

25
00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:33.058
type in www.powerbi.com and
this will bring you to the log in screen,

26
00:01:33.058 --> 00:01:37.601
and from here you can sign in if
you have an educational or company,

27
00:01:37.601 --> 00:01:41.440
sign in or
you can get a free trial license.

28
00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.920
Once you have logged into power, BI you're
automatically come to your home page,

29
00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.570
which gives you quick access to
your favorites and your frequents.

30
00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.903
But when we publish content, we're going
to need to publish it to a workspace,

31
00:01:55.903 --> 00:01:57.800
so let's see what they look like.

32
00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.418
I'm going to come down on the left
workspaces and click to expand the panel,

33
00:02:02.418 --> 00:02:04.890
and at the top you'll see my workspace.

34
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.039
Everybody has their own work space where
they can put their own private content.

35
00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.891
You may also have been given access
to other workspaces, and of course,

36
00:02:13.891 --> 00:02:16.540
you can create your own work spaces.

37
00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.145
When you want to share content or
collaborate on content,

38
00:02:20.145 --> 00:02:23.391
you're better off using
one of the app workspaces.

39
00:02:23.391 --> 00:02:26.420
That's these workspaces rather
than your my workspace.

40
00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.710
That's because nobody else has
access to your my workspace.

41
00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.902
So if you go on long service, leave or
leave the company, they're not

42
00:02:33.902 --> 00:02:38.391
going to be able to maintain or update
those reports to create a workspace.

43
00:02:38.391 --> 00:02:38.911
You just click.

44
00:02:38.911 --> 00:02:43.080
They'll create workspace button,
and here I can give it a name and

45
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.351
a description and.

46
00:02:44.351 --> 00:02:46.138
If you'd like to work along with me,

47
00:02:46.138 --> 00:02:49.940
just create a temporary workspace
called sales report or something.

48
00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:55.740
And, I've already created it, So
I'm going to come back to work spaces.

49
00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.740
And I'm going to select sales report.

50
00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.664
Haven't added any content yet, but

51
00:03:00.664 --> 00:03:04.540
this is where I'm going to publish
my sales report in a moment.

52
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.401
And if you don't have access to power,
BI service don't worry.

53
00:03:07.401 --> 00:03:12.131
You can just watch this video,
if I'd like to be able to have other

54
00:03:12.131 --> 00:03:17.340
people access the space that
we can collaborate together.

55
00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.182
If you come to the access tab,

56
00:03:19.182 --> 00:03:23.331
you can invite other people in
your organization or even outside.

57
00:03:23.331 --> 00:03:27.560
The organization is guests to
collaborate in this workspace.

58
00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.879
You'll just need to pop in their email
address and then you can also specify

59
00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:38.050
their permissions, so That's a very,
very quick of yuan workspaces.

60
00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.371
Let's now go back to power BI and

61
00:03:41.371 --> 00:03:47.410
publish our report on
the Home Ribbon in Power BI desktop.

62
00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.670
You will find a great big publish
button and went click on that.

63
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.361
It may ask you to save your report.

64
00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.290
If you haven't really signed in, you'll
also be asked to sign into the service.

65
00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.561
And then you'll be asked
to select the workspace.

66
00:04:01.561 --> 00:04:04.140
You want to publish the report to.

67
00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.581
And I'd like to publish
it to my sales reports.

68
00:04:06.581 --> 00:04:09.261
I'm going to select that and
click the select button.

69
00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.244
Once it's published the report,
you'll get a little success message, and

70
00:04:16.244 --> 00:04:18.030
it will even give you, a hyperlinks.

71
00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.070
You can navigate directly to
the report on the Power BI service.

72
00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.779
We're actually going to
go in the manual way, so

73
00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:27.961
I'm just going to close that and
coming back to my browser.

74
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.395
It might need a second to refresh,
but there it is, and

75
00:04:33.395 --> 00:04:36.048
you'll notice that my report and

76
00:04:36.048 --> 00:04:41.190
my data model my data actually
come in as two separate entities.

77
00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.921
And that's great because it means I can
actually generate multiple reports using

78
00:04:45.921 --> 00:04:47.740
the same data model.

79
00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.504
So For example, if I come to the ellipsis
and click on it, I can create a brand

80
00:04:52.504 --> 00:04:57.361
new report and we can create reports and
edit thumb right here in the service.

81
00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.226
What we're going to do now is we're going
to actually open up Our sales report and

82
00:05:03.226 --> 00:05:07.491
the navigation has moved to the left
rather than at the bottom of the report.

83
00:05:07.491 --> 00:05:11.751
But otherwise it's almost
identical I can edit it and.

84
00:05:11.751 --> 00:05:14.940
Of course, I can interact with it.

85
00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:20.540
I also have a lot of options for
either exporting or sharing the report.

86
00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:22.980
Let's look at the export options first.

87
00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:26.961
So coming to the top, I'm going to click
the drop down next to Export Ondas.

88
00:05:26.961 --> 00:05:33.240
Well, as Pdf and Excel, we also have
the option to export to power point.

89
00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.912
Now, if you spent hours copy pasting
individual visuals into Power point,

90
00:05:37.912 --> 00:05:40.840
this could be a great time saver.

91
00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.121
Now it will take a minute or two.

92
00:05:42.121 --> 00:05:44.119
But once it's created the power point,

93
00:05:44.119 --> 00:05:48.640
if we're automatically downloaded to your
downloads folder, so check that out.

94
00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.150
You also have the option to.

95
00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.760
Send a link to this report in your teams.

96
00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.320
So if you click on that,

97
00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:00.840
you can select the channel that
you want to send the message to.

98
00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:07.070
Alternatively, if you come to the share
option, you can share the report directly.

99
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:10.890
This is great if you need to share it
with one or two other collaborators.

100
00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:11.761
Developers.

101
00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:16.884
If you want a broad audience,
you can actually get an embed code, and

102
00:06:16.884 --> 00:06:20.440
from there you can share
it on SharePoint online.

103
00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:24.339
You can share it on a website or
portal with a security level log in so

104
00:06:24.339 --> 00:06:27.540
they'll have to actually log in to see it.

105
00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:31.361
Or you could go for
a published to Web public again.

106
00:06:31.361 --> 00:06:33.103
This will give you an embed code,

107
00:06:33.103 --> 00:06:36.110
which you could put in a blogger
on your company website.

108
00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:39.720
But just be aware that that will
be available to the public.

109
00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:43.651
There's no security around that, so
don't use that unless it's public data.

110
00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:46.800
So quite a few options there.

111
00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:52.774
But if you want to make this available to
a broader audience off business users,

112
00:06:52.774 --> 00:06:56.940
probably your best option
is to create an app.

113
00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:59.933
Now that sounds really complicated, but

114
00:06:59.933 --> 00:07:05.833
it isn't an app is really just a container
where we can combine related reports and

115
00:07:05.833 --> 00:07:10.040
dashboards in one place for
easy distribution.

116
00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:14.190
We've got our report, but
we don't actually have a dashboard yet.

117
00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:16.024
So let's first create a dashboard,

118
00:07:16.024 --> 00:07:18.940
and then we'll look at how
we can create the app.

119
00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:21.840
Creating a dashboard in
the service is really easy.

120
00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:26.474
All you need to do is grab the visuals
from whichever reports they sit in and

121
00:07:26.474 --> 00:07:28.090
pin them to a dashboard.

122
00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:32.302
So, for example, if you come to
your mat visual and hover over it,

123
00:07:32.302 --> 00:07:35.110
you see a little pushpin
appears at the top.

124
00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:38.980
Now, this isn't available in desktop only,
in the service.

125
00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:40.688
So if you click the pin visual,

126
00:07:40.688 --> 00:07:45.640
it's going to ask you if you want to pin
it to an existing dashboard or a new one.

127
00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:48.450
I don't have any existing one, so
we're going to create a new one.

128
00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:50.761
I'm going to call it Sales Dash.

129
00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:53.361
Then I'm going to select Pin.

130
00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:57.497
Now.
It's giving me the option to go straight

131
00:07:57.497 --> 00:08:01.081
to the dashboard or create a phone
view because you can view these on

132
00:08:01.081 --> 00:08:04.729
Mobile App as Well, we're just
going to close that for the meantime,

133
00:08:04.729 --> 00:08:06.781
and I'm going to pin something else.

134
00:08:06.781 --> 00:08:09.140
Let's do our orders.

135
00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:14.930
So I'm just going to select the pin and
pin and just close it up again.

136
00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:21.371
We'll do revenue as well, and
let's get something from a different page.

137
00:08:21.371 --> 00:08:23.180
I'm going to come to sales trends.

138
00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:29.780
Alright, that and we're also going
to Pinar Waterfall Chart and Pin.

139
00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:32.050
And this time I want to see the dashboard.

140
00:08:32.050 --> 00:08:34.461
So we're going to click
the goat dashboard button.

141
00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:39.740
There's my brand new dashboard,
really easy to create.

142
00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:43.640
So what's the difference between
a dashboard and a report?

143
00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:46.530
A dashboard is intended as an overview.

144
00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:48.834
You're limited to a single page, and

145
00:08:48.834 --> 00:08:51.861
you don't have the same
level of interactivity.

146
00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:57.868
You'll also notice that the dashboard
is constructed out of a set of tiles so

147
00:08:57.868 --> 00:09:01.740
you don't have the same
flexibility in terms of the size.

148
00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:03.631
So, for example,
if I come to my map chart,

149
00:09:03.631 --> 00:09:05.281
come to the bottom right hand corner.

150
00:09:05.281 --> 00:09:07.740
You get that little white,
double headed arrow.

151
00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:12.620
If I click and drag it down to about
halfway down the waterfall when I release,

152
00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:15.940
it actually goes the whole way down.

153
00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:17.941
So not quite the same flexibility.

154
00:09:17.941 --> 00:09:21.440
But you do end up with
a very neat solution.

155
00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:24.440
If I want to see one of
these visuals in focus mode.

156
00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:28.805
I can still do that if you come up to
your lips, is top right hand corner and

157
00:09:28.805 --> 00:09:30.461
choose open in focus mode.

158
00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:38.335
There we have it and I can exit Focus mode
with your card visuals in the dashboard

159
00:09:38.335 --> 00:09:42.771
view, you actually get additional
option that we don't have.

160
00:09:42.771 --> 00:09:46.834
In reports, If I come to one of my
cards and click the three dots,

161
00:09:46.834 --> 00:09:49.090
there's an option to add alerts.

162
00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:54.264
So, for example, if I wanted to receive
an alert when I hit 1300 orders,

163
00:09:54.264 --> 00:09:59.040
I could click and alert rule and
going specify my criteria.

164
00:09:59.040 --> 00:09:59.790
Really cool.

165
00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:02.721
All right, I'm going to cancel out of
that because I don't actually want to say

166
00:10:02.721 --> 00:10:04.140
that option.

167
00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:07.367
If you click on any of
the visuals in a dashboard,

168
00:10:07.367 --> 00:10:12.172
it will automatically drill down to
show you the full detail in the report

169
00:10:12.172 --> 00:10:14.961
where that visual originally came from.

170
00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:18.900
So that was how we could
create a dashboard.

171
00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:22.040
Now let's see how we create an app.

172
00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:25.974
I'm going to come back to my
sales report workspace and

173
00:10:25.974 --> 00:10:28.130
on the top right hand corner.

174
00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:32.861
You'll see the option to
create app that easy and.

175
00:10:32.861 --> 00:10:36.054
When we click on it, it's going to ask
us what we want to call the APP, and

176
00:10:36.054 --> 00:10:37.700
it's going to ask for a description.

177
00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:39.750
Something called on both sales report.

178
00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:43.270
You can specify a logo and a theme color.

179
00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:47.267
If you come to navigation,
you can also choose by moving these up and

180
00:10:47.267 --> 00:10:51.540
down, whether you wanted to open
the dash first or the report first.

181
00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:56.160
We're happy with Dash, so we're going to
leave that and then coming to permissions.

182
00:10:56.160 --> 00:11:01.303
You can choose who this report is going
to be available to, and you could share

183
00:11:01.303 --> 00:11:07.130
it with your entire organization or
just some specific individuals or groups.

184
00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:10.430
This is just test, so
I'm just going to share it with myself.

185
00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:15.174
I'm just going to pop my
own address in there,

186
00:11:15.174 --> 00:11:20.047
and then I'm going to click,
publish app and

187
00:11:20.047 --> 00:11:26.091
then I'm going to click
publish when it's published.

188
00:11:26.091 --> 00:11:30.060
It will give you a link to that app,
and you can copy that and

189
00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:34.230
paste it into an email to make it easy for
people to access it.

190
00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:39.029
But it's actually pretty easy anyway,
so I'm just going to close that and

191
00:11:39.029 --> 00:11:44.140
now let's see how we would access
an app that had been shared with us.

192
00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:48.199
I'm going to come to APPS
on the left hand side and

193
00:11:48.199 --> 00:11:53.660
at the top right hand corner is
a button to allow us to get our APPs.

194
00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:56.124
I'm going to click on that now,

195
00:11:56.124 --> 00:12:00.881
and this will show me all the APPS
that are available to me now.

196
00:12:00.881 --> 00:12:03.345
The sales report I've only
shared with myself, so

197
00:12:03.345 --> 00:12:06.440
nobody else in my organization
will be able to see that.

198
00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:08.320
But I'm going to go and get that now.

199
00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:10.030
So just click on it and

200
00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:15.641
it will immediately add your selected
app to your APPS to open the app.

201
00:12:15.641 --> 00:12:21.510
We just click on it and
there's my dashboard to drill down.

202
00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:24.896
I can just click on any of the visuals and

203
00:12:24.896 --> 00:12:30.961
that will bring me into my report,
which is completely interactive.

204
00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:35.681
So we've seen how we can publish a power.

205
00:12:35.681 --> 00:12:38.533
BI report to the power BI service, and

206
00:12:38.533 --> 00:12:43.793
from there we can create a dashboard and
a nap for a very user friendly,

207
00:12:43.793 --> 00:12:48.640
interactive experience That brings
us to the end of the course.

208
00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:53.328
But the beginning of your journey
with power Query, power pivot and

209
00:12:53.328 --> 00:12:55.561
power BI Thanks for joining us.

210
00:12:55.561 --> 00:12:56.768
And we wish you powerful success.
