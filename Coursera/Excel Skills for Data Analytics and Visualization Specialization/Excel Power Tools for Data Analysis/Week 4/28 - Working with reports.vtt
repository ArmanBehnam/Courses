00:00:00.103 --> 00:00:07.577
In this video, we're going to
look at a range of features for

2
00:00:07.577 --> 00:00:11.543
working with power BI reports.

3
00:00:11.543 --> 00:00:14.881
We're going to start by
coming to our map visual and

4
00:00:14.881 --> 00:00:20.220
at the top right hand corner, if you hover
of the little icon called focus mode.

5
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.580
When we click on it, it actually
brings that visual into focus so

6
00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.936
we can concentrate on the detail.

7
00:00:26.936 --> 00:00:31.834
To come out of focus mode, you can either
click the back to report button or

8
00:00:31.834 --> 00:00:34.689
press the escape button on your keyboard.

9
00:00:34.689 --> 00:00:38.477
Similar to focus mode,
if you click the little ellipses,

10
00:00:38.477 --> 00:00:43.740
the three dots top right hand corner,
you have the option to show as table.

11
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.384
And this looks very similar to focus mode,

12
00:00:46.384 --> 00:00:51.460
but it also gives you a table with the
actual values represented in the graphic.

13
00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.840
So great way of drilling down and
seeing the detail.

14
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.780
And again we could just
press escape to come out.

15
00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.430
If you want to actually stay on the report
page but focus on an individual visual,

16
00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:08.249
another option we have is to come
to ellipsis and clicked spotlight,

17
00:01:08.249 --> 00:01:12.487
and that will white out everything
other than that visual and

18
00:01:12.487 --> 00:01:15.089
then again just escape to come back.

19
00:01:15.089 --> 00:01:18.551
Now, we're going to come
back to focus mode again.

20
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.421
And some of you may have already noticed
that a piece of France has ended up in

21
00:01:24.421 --> 00:01:28.381
Africa and a piece of Canada seems
to have wandered off as well.

22
00:01:28.381 --> 00:01:33.155
Now that's because we are working with
state and while it has recognized as

23
00:01:33.155 --> 00:01:38.251
being geographical data, there's some
ambiguity about where that state is.

24
00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.640
So we're going to look at options for
fixing this.

25
00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.740
The first option, which is worth trying,
is categorizing the data.

26
00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.220
Let's see how that works.

27
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.721
So we got to come to our customer
table on the right hand side.

28
00:01:53.721 --> 00:01:56.800
And we're going to select the state field.

29
00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.982
When you do,
it opens up your column tools panel, and

30
00:01:59.982 --> 00:02:03.640
you'll see the state of
the moment is uncategorized.

31
00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.940
I'm going to click the drop down, and
I'm going to categorize it as county.

32
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.265
And when I selected, you'll see it
has fixed the problem with France but

33
00:02:14.265 --> 00:02:18.626
we seem to have created more of
a problem in the Americas, so

34
00:02:18.626 --> 00:02:22.540
without data, it hasn't worked perfectly.

35
00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.765
Another option is to remove the ambiguity
by creating a calculated column

36
00:02:27.765 --> 00:02:33.420
that has country and stayed in it, and
that's what we're going to do next.

37
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.700
Now we've actually seen two ways
of creating a calculated column.

38
00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.236
We can do it in our data
model using decks, or

39
00:02:40.236 --> 00:02:45.140
we can do it in the query
editor using our M language.

40
00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.850
And at this point you're
probably wondering which is best.

41
00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:55.620
Well, the answer is, it depends, but let
me try and explain as simply as possible.

42
00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.510
Dax is a data analysis language.

43
00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.904
So if you're creating a calculated column
to work out your sales to date, for

44
00:03:02.904 --> 00:03:06.096
example, you're probably
better off doing it in Dax.

45
00:03:06.096 --> 00:03:11.970
M, which is our power query language,
is a transformational language.

46
00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.017
It's ideal for making data
transformations like concatenation,

47
00:03:16.017 --> 00:03:18.740
which is what we're trying to do here.

48
00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.919
So for this scenario, we're better
off doing an in power query, and

49
00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:28.340
it gives us an opportunity to see how we
can get into our query editor in power BI.

50
00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.844
So we're going to come to our home
ribbon and you're going to look for

51
00:03:32.844 --> 00:03:37.271
the transformed data button, and
I'm going to click the top half,

52
00:03:37.271 --> 00:03:41.091
and that is going to bring me
back to my power query editor.

53
00:03:41.091 --> 00:03:44.396
Now making sure you've got
the customer table selected,

54
00:03:44.396 --> 00:03:46.091
we're going to add a column.

55
00:03:46.091 --> 00:03:50.561
So select add column in your ribbon and
we're going to add a custom column.

56
00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.833
We're going to call our
new column region and

57
00:03:56.833 --> 00:04:01.630
then clicking in the box
where our formula goes.

58
00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.911
We're going to start by grabbing country.

59
00:04:04.911 --> 00:04:08.232
So if you could just double select
country from the available columns and

60
00:04:08.232 --> 00:04:09.780
then we get a concussion-ate.

61
00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.724
So for this,
we're going to need our M percent and

62
00:04:12.724 --> 00:04:14.941
we're going to want to put a comma.

63
00:04:14.941 --> 00:04:18.456
But this is text so
openly double quotes, type of comma and

64
00:04:18.456 --> 00:04:21.640
a space just to make it more readable.

65
00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.594
And then on the other side
of your double quotes,

66
00:04:24.594 --> 00:04:29.651
we're going to need another M present and
then we're going to double click on state.

67
00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.854
We're now going to click okay and

68
00:04:33.854 --> 00:04:38.940
are calculated column with country and
state has been added.

69
00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.303
We're down in the query editor, so
coming back to our home ribbon,

70
00:04:42.303 --> 00:04:45.190
we're going to click close and apply.

71
00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:50.669
We'll give it a moment
to apply the changes and

72
00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:56.310
now we're going to replace
state with region.

73
00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.727
So in your visualizations panel,
we're going to remove state and

74
00:05:00.727 --> 00:05:03.361
instead we're going to select region.

75
00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:06.640
Problem is fixed.

76
00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.260
We can now go back to our report.

77
00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:14.340
So clicking back to report,
let's not heckle a different problem.

78
00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.797
Our area chart is showing
us our revenue by year, but

79
00:05:17.797 --> 00:05:22.640
we'd like a slightly more fine
breakdown by month within year.

80
00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:27.840
And the best way to do this in
power BI is to use a hierarchy.

81
00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.390
We did see how to create hierarchies
in power pivot last week.

82
00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:35.659
What we going to see now is it's
even easier in power BI, so

83
00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:40.731
coming to our calendar table now,
we're going to just expand that.

84
00:05:40.731 --> 00:05:46.140
What we would like is a hierarchy with
fiscal year, fiscal month and day.

85
00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:49.491
I'm going to find fiscal month and
if needs be, make this a little wider.

86
00:05:49.491 --> 00:05:52.714
So you can check it's month and
not month number, and

87
00:05:52.714 --> 00:05:57.311
I'm going to grab fiscal month click drag
and just drop it onto fiscal here on.

88
00:05:57.311 --> 00:06:01.500
Whenever you drop one field onto another,
it creates hierarchy for you.

89
00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.040
So really easy.

90
00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:08.409
Let's do the same with day, so I'm just
going to find a click drag on drop that

91
00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:13.510
onto my hierarchy this time and
there's my hierarchy, really easy.

92
00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:18.246
If you want to rename it,
just click the ellipsis or

93
00:06:18.246 --> 00:06:21.329
right click and you can rename and

94
00:06:21.329 --> 00:06:26.961
I'm going to call my new hierarchy
at fiscal date and present.

95
00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:34.472
Now clicking on the area chart, what we're
going to do is remove fiscal year and

96
00:06:34.472 --> 00:06:40.097
replace it with our fiscal date hierarchy
to begin with, the chart looks identical,

97
00:06:40.097 --> 00:06:45.020
but you'll notice some new icons have
appeared at the top of the chart.

98
00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:50.332
And the one we're looking for is expand
all down one level in the hierarchy,

99
00:06:50.332 --> 00:06:56.140
and when we click on that, we can actually
now see revenue by month and year.

100
00:06:56.140 --> 00:07:01.200
If we expand again, we're going to get by
day as well, which is maybe too detailed.

101
00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:04.051
So to drill up,
just click on your drill up error.

102
00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:07.981
And, of course, you're not limited
to date with your hierarchies.

103
00:07:07.981 --> 00:07:12.269
You could have country data,
whatever it is you need.

104
00:07:12.269 --> 00:07:17.440
Within the chart,
it should have sorted by month and year.

105
00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.370
But if you find your sort,
order is not correct.

106
00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:24.851
If you come to ellipsis, you'll see
you have the option to sort, and

107
00:07:24.851 --> 00:07:28.430
I could sort by revenue or
fiscal year in fiscal month.

108
00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:32.351
So just make sure that sort order is
set correctly for your visualization.

109
00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:37.621
Within a matrix on the table,
you have another option.

110
00:07:37.621 --> 00:07:42.580
You can sort by column heading at the
moment, the status sorted by fiscal month.

111
00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:47.760
But if I come to total and click on
the heading, it will sort descending.

112
00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:51.140
If I click again,
it will switch it to ascending.

113
00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:55.550
And if I click back on fiscal month,
it was solved by month.

114
00:07:55.550 --> 00:08:02.240
So very easy to sort in our visualizations
and, of course, also very easy to filter.

115
00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.990
We've already seen one option.

116
00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:08.508
So, for example, if I click on
a category or a series say, bikes,

117
00:08:08.508 --> 00:08:12.648
it will filter that entire page
to show me the data for bikes.

118
00:08:12.648 --> 00:08:17.352
To clear that filter, I can click
anywhere in that visual all back on my

119
00:08:17.352 --> 00:08:20.561
original selection, and
that will remove it.

120
00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:26.414
What about if I wanted to filter my
donut chart to show all categories other

121
00:08:26.414 --> 00:08:27.266
than bikes?

122
00:08:27.266 --> 00:08:32.743
For that, what I'm going to need to do is
go to my filter's panel, so we're going to

123
00:08:32.743 --> 00:08:38.067
expand our filters pain, and I'm going to
tuck visualizations away for a moment and

124
00:08:38.067 --> 00:08:42.860
all the fields that have been added to
that visual we can use to filter by.

125
00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:46.995
But we can also add any other
fields from our field list.

126
00:08:46.995 --> 00:08:50.668
Coming to my category,
I'm going to click the drop down and

127
00:08:50.668 --> 00:08:54.861
I'm going to choose select all and
then I'm going to unselect bikes.

128
00:08:56.440 --> 00:09:00.040
And that is now shown me all
the categories other than bikes.

129
00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:04.377
To clear that filter,
I can either click select all again or

130
00:09:04.377 --> 00:09:09.085
I can click on the small eraser,
and that will clear the filter.

131
00:09:09.085 --> 00:09:11.630
So very much like a pivot table.

132
00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:17.117
But what makes the filters in power
bi I very interesting is we also have

133
00:09:17.117 --> 00:09:23.180
the option to add filters for the entire
page, or even for the entire report.

134
00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:29.340
So that's all pages in the report, so
a huge amount weaken do with filters.

135
00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:34.140
And if you're wondering,
we can also add slices.

136
00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:35.530
Let's go and do that now.

137
00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:40.161
So I'm going to close up the filters
pain and expand the visualizations pane.

138
00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:46.238
And we're going to need to make
a bit of space for our slicer, so

139
00:09:46.238 --> 00:09:52.821
I'm going to select my area chart and then
I'm just going to bring in a little bit.

140
00:09:52.821 --> 00:09:56.540
So I've got some space to put my slicer.

141
00:09:56.540 --> 00:10:01.597
Then just click onto the canvas,
come to a visualization section and

142
00:10:01.597 --> 00:10:07.500
we're looking for the slicer visual and
we would like to filter by fiscal year.

143
00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:13.340
So in your fields panel, can you please
find fiscal year and just tick to select.

144
00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:15.374
I'm now going to resize that.

145
00:10:15.374 --> 00:10:20.903
So I'm going to move that into place and
because it is numeric data we're filtering

146
00:10:20.903 --> 00:10:25.797
by, it has given us the slider, but
you're not limited to the slider.

147
00:10:25.797 --> 00:10:29.860
If you come to the top right hand
corner and click the drop down,

148
00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:35.007
they're actually five options you can
choose from and the one we want is a list.

149
00:10:35.007 --> 00:10:38.240
So I'm going to select list and
there's my slicer.

150
00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:40.890
If I now select 2018,

151
00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:46.561
it is filtered my entire
page to show data for 2018.

152
00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:51.350
And the slices worked quite
happily alongside other filters.

153
00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:54.712
So if I come down to my donut chart and
select bikes,

154
00:10:54.712 --> 00:10:57.940
both filters have now been applied.

155
00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:01.276
Now it could become a little confusing
trying to work out which filters haven't

156
00:11:01.276 --> 00:11:02.450
hadn't been added.

157
00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:04.255
If you come to any of your visuals,

158
00:11:04.255 --> 00:11:07.495
you'll see their little filter icon and
when I hover over it,

159
00:11:07.495 --> 00:11:12.140
it's telling me all the filters that
have been applied to this visual.

160
00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:15.240
I'm going to turn
the bikes filter off again.

161
00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:20.224
Okay, now it's also quite possible
that you'll want your slicer

162
00:11:20.224 --> 00:11:23.270
to not be connected to certain visuals.

163
00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:26.373
So, for example, when I filter by year,

164
00:11:26.373 --> 00:11:31.740
I don't actually want to change
my violin plot or my matrix.

165
00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:35.239
We can actually choose which
visuals filter other visuals, and

166
00:11:35.239 --> 00:11:37.330
I'm going to show you how to do that now.

167
00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:40.061
So let's clear the slicer
from fiscal year.

168
00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:44.140
They were going to come
to our format ribbon.

169
00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:48.380
We're going to edit interactions, so
I'm going to click Edit interactions.

170
00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:52.042
And two icons have appeared at
the top of all my other visuals,

171
00:11:52.042 --> 00:11:55.840
giving me the option to either filter or
not filter.

172
00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:59.378
I'm going to come to my violin plot and
select no filter and

173
00:11:59.378 --> 00:12:04.940
the same with my matrix, and then I'm
going to turn off headed interactions.

174
00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:07.931
And now, if I come down and select 2018,

175
00:12:07.931 --> 00:12:12.355
everything's filtered except for
my violent plot and my matrix.

176
00:12:12.355 --> 00:12:17.615
By default, slices only work on the
current page, but we do have the option

177
00:12:17.615 --> 00:12:23.540
to create synchronized slices across
different pages in the report.

178
00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:27.091
To do this, we're going to come
to our view tab on our ribbon and

179
00:12:27.091 --> 00:12:30.575
on the far right we're going to
turn on our sink slices paint, so

180
00:12:30.575 --> 00:12:33.861
just click on that button and
a new panels being opened up.

181
00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:39.789
This will show all the pages in the
report, and if we choose to synchronize

182
00:12:39.789 --> 00:12:44.510
the slicer, it will actually
synchronize the slices across the two.

183
00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:46.823
Now it does actually add the slicer, but

184
00:12:46.823 --> 00:12:50.440
you can choose whether you
want it to be visible or not.

185
00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:52.866
I do want to be visible, so
I'm going to take that, and

186
00:12:52.866 --> 00:12:54.641
I'm going to take sales report as well.

187
00:12:54.641 --> 00:12:57.340
So it synchronizes both ways.

188
00:12:57.340 --> 00:13:02.417
I'm going to close my sink slices panel
now, and if you come to sales trends,

189
00:13:02.417 --> 00:13:07.340
you'll see a slice has been added and
it has filtered the report.

190
00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:10.511
If I flipped the server to 2019,

191
00:13:10.511 --> 00:13:16.630
that changes it on sales trends and
it changes it on the sales report.

192
00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:20.440
So that's how we can create
synchronized slices.

193
00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:24.829
One last little thing we're going to
look at, can I ask you to click on

194
00:13:24.829 --> 00:13:28.919
your area chart again and
coming to your visualizations panel,

195
00:13:28.919 --> 00:13:32.370
we've looked at the first button,
which is Fields.

196
00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:36.957
We've looked at the formatting tools, but
there's one more button called analytics,

197
00:13:36.957 --> 00:13:38.621
which we haven't had a look at.

198
00:13:38.621 --> 00:13:40.400
So we're going to take
a quick peek of that.

199
00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:45.141
So clicking on analytics,
there are few options we can adhere on.

200
00:13:45.141 --> 00:13:47.081
What we'd like is an average lines.

201
00:13:47.081 --> 00:13:50.061
I'm going to click the drop down and
I'm going to click add.

202
00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:55.796
And it is now added an average
line to our area chart so

203
00:13:55.796 --> 00:14:00.461
we can see where our revenue was above or
below average.

204
00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:07.971
We have seen quite a range of tools now,
including slices, filters, hierarchies and

205
00:14:07.971 --> 00:14:13.350
analytics that will help us work more
effectively without power Bi I reports.

206
00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:18.311
It has been quite a quick overview, but
now that you know where all these tools

207
00:14:18.311 --> 00:14:22.060
are, you can take some time
to investigate them further.
