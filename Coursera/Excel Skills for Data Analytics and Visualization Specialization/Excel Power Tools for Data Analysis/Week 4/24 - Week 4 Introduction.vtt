00:00:05.472 --> 00:00:09.097
Over the last few weeks,
we have worked with Power Query for

2
00:00:09.097 --> 00:00:11.272
cleaning and preparing our data and

3
00:00:11.272 --> 00:00:15.840
Power Pivot for performing
powerful data analysis in Excel.

4
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.455
These new tools introduce us to new
approaches in working with data on a whole

5
00:00:20.455 --> 00:00:23.840
new range of functions in the DAX library.

6
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.710
It is quite a lot to learn, but
here's some really great news.

7
00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.350
We are actually learning two tools for
the price of one.

8
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.704
Power Query and
the data model also form the heart of

9
00:00:34.704 --> 00:00:39.540
Microsoft's business intelligence
tool called a Power BI.

10
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.564
And for the final phase of our analysis,
plating up and

11
00:00:42.564 --> 00:00:47.940
presenting our analytics, we're going
to introduce you to this amazing tool.

12
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.968
So what is Power BI?

13
00:00:49.968 --> 00:00:54.689
Power BI is actually a collection of
services that allow us to model, analyze,

14
00:00:54.689 --> 00:00:56.640
and visualize data.

15
00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.099
The main tool for
achieving this is Power BI Desktop, and

16
00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:02.851
that is what we will be
focusing on this week.

17
00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.411
Power BI Desktop is a free tool that
can be downloaded for Windows 32 or

18
00:01:08.411 --> 00:01:10.740
64 bit platforms.

19
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.040
Power BI Desktop allows us to connect to
data from an almost unlimited range of

20
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:22.002
sources, including Excel, SQL databases,
cloud services, and even Salesforce.

21
00:01:22.002 --> 00:01:26.506
Power BI uses Power Query to get and
transform the data, and

22
00:01:26.506 --> 00:01:31.371
then loads it into the same database
engine used by Power Pivot,

23
00:01:31.371 --> 00:01:33.821
where we can build a data model.

24
00:01:33.821 --> 00:01:36.941
In Power BI Desktop with
a little help from DAX,

25
00:01:36.941 --> 00:01:41.855
we can create stunning interactive
reports with a much bigger selection of

26
00:01:41.855 --> 00:01:45.055
visualizations than Excel
pivot tables offer.

27
00:01:45.055 --> 00:01:48.351
And tools better tailored for
creating a visual experience.

28
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.240
Having created these stunning reports,
we will probably want to share them.

29
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.094
Microsoft provides two platforms for
hosting finished Power BI reports.

30
00:01:59.094 --> 00:02:04.021
The Power BI service, which is
an online software as a service portal,

31
00:02:04.021 --> 00:02:06.577
accessible through PowerBI.com.

32
00:02:06.577 --> 00:02:11.526
And the Power BI reports server,
which is an on premises application

33
00:02:11.526 --> 00:02:15.895
that an organization can host
on their own infrastructure.

34
00:02:15.895 --> 00:02:20.354
The Power BI service is the most
widely utilized option and

35
00:02:20.354 --> 00:02:25.940
in turn has three licensing options,
free, pro, and premium.

36
00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.882
But even to access the free option,
you will require a company or

37
00:02:29.882 --> 00:02:31.197
educational log in.

38
00:02:31.197 --> 00:02:34.661
For more details on this,
check out this week's toolbox.

39
00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.777
In our last video, we will have a quick
look at how to publish to the server and

40
00:02:40.777 --> 00:02:42.740
create a dashboard.

41
00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.740
But this video is one you can just
watch and don't need to work alongside.

42
00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.672
This week, we will cover
getting started with Power BI,

43
00:02:52.672 --> 00:02:58.736
building report in Power BI Desktop,
working with Power BI reports,

44
00:02:58.736 --> 00:03:05.932
adding a calendar table using DAX, time
intelligence and predictive analytics,

45
00:03:05.932 --> 00:03:10.999
and finally creating a dashboard
in the Power BI service.

46
00:03:10.999 --> 00:03:15.724
Before getting started this week, please
follow the link in this week's material to

47
00:03:15.724 --> 00:03:19.140
download and
install the Power BI Desktop app.

48
00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.241
Now get your exercise files and
get fired up,

49
00:03:22.241 --> 00:03:25.350
because we've got one
more great week to go.

50
00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.850
