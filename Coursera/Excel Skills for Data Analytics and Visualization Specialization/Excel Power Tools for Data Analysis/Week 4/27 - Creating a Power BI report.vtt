00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.740
In this video, we're going
to focus on developing

2
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.690
our Power BI report and some

3
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.210
of the tools that
can help us do this.

4
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.490
To begin with, we would like

5
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.500
to add our corporate branding,

6
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.145
so we want to put our company
logo onto our report.

7
00:00:20.145 --> 00:00:23.445
We're going to come up
to our insert ribbon.

8
00:00:23.445 --> 00:00:25.380
There's some great tools that we

9
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.150
can insert from this ribbon.

10
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.475
For example, the Q&A will provide

11
00:00:29.475 --> 00:00:31.710
report users with the option

12
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.825
to interrogate the data directly.

13
00:00:33.825 --> 00:00:35.820
We can add text boxes, buttons,

14
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.060
shapes, or what we're looking
for, which is an image.

15
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.210
We're going to click, "Image" and

16
00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.720
just navigate to your
downloads folder,

17
00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.880
and select the AW Banner.

18
00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.950
It has inserted the image,

19
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.290
and we're going to move it to

20
00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.270
the top left corner and then

21
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.515
resize it so it runs the
whole way across the report.

22
00:00:57.515 --> 00:00:59.540
The other thing
you may wish to do

23
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.810
is change the color scheme.

24
00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.040
We do this from our view ribbon.

25
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.215
I'm going to come to
the view tab this time,

26
00:01:06.215 --> 00:01:08.120
and there's a gallery of themes.

27
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.560
If you click the drop-down,

28
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.630
quite a few options
which will change

29
00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.695
your color scheme
throughout the report.

30
00:01:14.695 --> 00:01:18.105
If none of these
themes are suitable,

31
00:01:18.105 --> 00:01:19.790
there's actually a theme gallery

32
00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.070
available on the
Microsoft website.

33
00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.505
Some of these are
really stunning.

34
00:01:25.505 --> 00:01:27.190
They can be downloaded

35
00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.590
or you can just use
them as inspiration.

36
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.300
Alternatively, you
can just grab one of

37
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.505
the existing themes
and customize it,

38
00:01:36.505 --> 00:01:38.005
and that's what
we're going to do.

39
00:01:38.005 --> 00:01:40.570
Clicking the drop-down,
we're going to go for

40
00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.740
the high contrast and

41
00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.350
just see it's changed our
color scheme throughout.

42
00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.180
But our main colors are actually

43
00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.185
the light blue and the dark blue,

44
00:01:51.185 --> 00:01:54.760
so I want to make a small
customization to the theme.

45
00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.205
I'm going to come
back to my drop-down

46
00:01:57.205 --> 00:02:01.160
and I'm going to select,
"Customize current theme."

47
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.140
Here is where you can specify
the colors for your theme.

48
00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.690
For example, if I come to

49
00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.535
the light blue and
click the drop-down,

50
00:02:09.535 --> 00:02:12.790
you can either enter
hex code or an RGB.

51
00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.950
I'm just going to
copy that hex code,

52
00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.015
so Control C, because

53
00:02:17.015 --> 00:02:19.465
I'm going to swap the light
blue and green around.

54
00:02:19.465 --> 00:02:21.280
I'm then going to
come to color one.

55
00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.515
I'm going to check the RGBs,

56
00:02:23.515 --> 00:02:25.720
that's 16 124 16,

57
00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.580
and then I'm going
to paste my blue.

58
00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.805
Then coming back
to the light blue,

59
00:02:30.805 --> 00:02:32.995
I'm going to type in the RGB.

60
00:02:32.995 --> 00:02:38.170
That was 16 124 16.

61
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.215
If I then click, "Apply",

62
00:02:42.215 --> 00:02:45.075
that will then swap the
blue and the green around.

63
00:02:45.075 --> 00:02:49.340
Very easy to create
your own color scheme.

64
00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.060
By default, reports are
only a single page,

65
00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.985
but there's nothing to
stop us adding more pages.

66
00:02:55.985 --> 00:02:58.640
If you come down to the
bottom of the screen,

67
00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:59.930
you'll see this page is called,

68
00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.995
"Page 1". Not a great name.

69
00:03:01.995 --> 00:03:03.254
We're going to double-click,

70
00:03:03.254 --> 00:03:07.750
and I'm going to change
this to Sales Report.

71
00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.285
Then to add another page,

72
00:03:11.285 --> 00:03:14.990
I can either right-click on
this one and duplicate it,

73
00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:19.975
or I can click on the plus to
add a completely new page.

74
00:03:19.975 --> 00:03:23.220
I'm going to name this
one Sales Trends.

75
00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.740
Double-click, Sales Trends.

76
00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.155
Then coming back to
my sales report,

77
00:03:30.155 --> 00:03:31.610
I can copy paste any of

78
00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.595
the components on this
page onto the other one.

79
00:03:34.595 --> 00:03:36.335
I'm going to do
that with a banner,

80
00:03:36.335 --> 00:03:37.685
to selecting my banner,

81
00:03:37.685 --> 00:03:39.515
control C to copy,

82
00:03:39.515 --> 00:03:43.840
on to Sales Trends and
control V to paste.

83
00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.560
Terrific. Now, back
in my sales report,

84
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.310
on the banner, I actually want
to see three key metrics.

85
00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.300
I want to see my total revenue,

86
00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.445
the number of orders placed,

87
00:03:55.445 --> 00:03:58.885
and how many items
were actually sold.

88
00:03:58.885 --> 00:04:00.480
Now, if I come to

89
00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.970
my Order_Items on the
right-hand side and expand it,

90
00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.680
I already have a
measure for revenue,

91
00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.155
but I don't have measures
for the other two.

92
00:04:09.155 --> 00:04:12.385
Guess what? We're going
to create a few measures.

93
00:04:12.385 --> 00:04:15.075
Making sure you've got
all the items selected,

94
00:04:15.075 --> 00:04:16.950
come up to table tools ribbon,

95
00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.920
and we're going to
click, "New measure".

96
00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:25.050
The first one we're going
to add is our items sold.

97
00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:30.000
I'm going to call this,
"Items Sold" and equals.

98
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.460
This is going to be a sum, and

99
00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.755
I'm trying to add up
my order quantity.

100
00:04:34.755 --> 00:04:37.815
We're just going to
type qty and tab,

101
00:04:37.815 --> 00:04:41.980
close your bracket for your
sum, and press "Enter".

102
00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:45.260
You'll see another
measure has been added.

103
00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.085
Now we also want the
number of orders placed.

104
00:04:49.085 --> 00:04:52.380
Once again, can you
click, "New measure".

105
00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.830
We're going to call this one

106
00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.195
orders and equals but
this time it's a count,

107
00:05:00.195 --> 00:05:04.590
so COU and tab to select
count and we're going to

108
00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.335
count is our sales order ID

109
00:05:07.335 --> 00:05:10.125
because that uniquely
identifies each order.

110
00:05:10.125 --> 00:05:12.645
I'm just going to type SAL,

111
00:05:12.645 --> 00:05:15.240
the sales order ID

112
00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.180
and close our bracket
and press "Enter".

113
00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.490
Now something very interesting
I'd like you to notice,

114
00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.055
although the sales order ID

115
00:05:26.055 --> 00:05:29.235
is actually on our orders table,

116
00:05:29.235 --> 00:05:33.075
because we had selected all
the items in the first place,

117
00:05:33.075 --> 00:05:37.050
it has added that measure
to our order items table.

118
00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.180
Unlike calculated columns,

119
00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.970
measures are not tied
to a particular table,

120
00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:43.830
we can actually
store them anywhere.

121
00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:45.720
The default is to store them with

122
00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.075
the table where the
original data came from,

123
00:05:48.075 --> 00:05:50.970
it gives us context and
makes it easier to find,

124
00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:53.160
but we don't have to.

125
00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.810
As you can see here,
the measures are

126
00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:56.040
now being all scattered around.

127
00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.150
They can become hard to

128
00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.640
find and make it trickier
to work with them.

129
00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.370
So a lot of people will
actually recommend that you

130
00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:05.820
create a separate measures table.

131
00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:08.535
Some of the approaches
to doing this

132
00:06:08.535 --> 00:06:10.770
are quite clumsy and they can

133
00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:12.405
end up with downsides like

134
00:06:12.405 --> 00:06:14.610
either people end up hiding
a whole bunch of columns

135
00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:16.440
they might need later or it's

136
00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.780
quite hard to recognize where the

137
00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:21.180
data's coming from in
those measures when they

138
00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:24.075
are no longer associated
with the original table.

139
00:06:24.075 --> 00:06:27.750
Matt Allington, who is the
MI Power BI hero has come up

140
00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:29.685
with really neat solution

141
00:06:29.685 --> 00:06:31.545
and that is what
we're going to do.

142
00:06:31.545 --> 00:06:33.555
We're actually going to create

143
00:06:33.555 --> 00:06:36.930
a folder and put all of
our columns that are not

144
00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:39.510
measures inside the
folder so that all of

145
00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:40.680
our measures are grouped nicely

146
00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:43.065
together and quick to get to.

147
00:06:43.065 --> 00:06:44.610
Now that sounds complicated,

148
00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:46.665
but it's actually
really easy to do.

149
00:06:46.665 --> 00:06:48.150
On the left-hand side,

150
00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:50.520
can you come back to data model,

151
00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:54.165
find your order items table

152
00:06:54.165 --> 00:06:56.340
and we're going to click
the three little dots,

153
00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:59.520
the ellipses top-right corner
and you'll see we have

154
00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.050
the option to select all of

155
00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:03.570
our measures and put them
in a folder on their own,

156
00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:05.310
which a lot of people
will recommend,

157
00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:07.785
but the problem is it
makes them hard to get to,

158
00:07:07.785 --> 00:07:10.395
and it's the measures we
normally need to get to.

159
00:07:10.395 --> 00:07:12.480
Alternatively, we can reverse

160
00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:15.735
the thinking and
select more columns,

161
00:07:15.735 --> 00:07:16.860
and that's what
we're going to do.

162
00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:18.495
So select columns.

163
00:07:18.495 --> 00:07:21.495
If you're properties
panel is still hidden,

164
00:07:21.495 --> 00:07:24.060
can you just click
to expand that?

165
00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:26.745
We're going to create
a display folder,

166
00:07:26.745 --> 00:07:28.620
so click in that box.

167
00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:31.695
We're going to call it
underscore columns.

168
00:07:31.695 --> 00:07:34.725
We can't call it columns
because that's a reserved word.

169
00:07:34.725 --> 00:07:36.810
When we press "Enter",
it's going to

170
00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:38.790
take all the columns and put

171
00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:40.425
them in their own folder

172
00:07:40.425 --> 00:07:42.930
which you can now see has
happened on the right.

173
00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:46.360
Coming back to our report,

174
00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:49.500
you will see that
the columns folders

175
00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.330
automatically collapsed and

176
00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:53.220
now all of our measures
are still with

177
00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:55.635
the order items so still
in a logical place,

178
00:07:55.635 --> 00:07:58.500
but really easy to
find and get to.

179
00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:01.365
All right, great.
We are organized.

180
00:08:01.365 --> 00:08:03.105
Let's go and create
those metrics.

181
00:08:03.105 --> 00:08:04.920
I'm just going to
shrink this table up a

182
00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:07.870
little bit so we've got
some space to work in.

183
00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:11.775
We're going to start
with our orders.

184
00:08:11.775 --> 00:08:13.335
Can you grab orders, drag it,

185
00:08:13.335 --> 00:08:15.210
and drop it onto your canvas

186
00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:17.400
and we are automatically
getting a column chart,

187
00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:21.285
which in this case is not
telling us very much.

188
00:08:21.285 --> 00:08:23.910
What we'd prefer to have
is the actual number

189
00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:27.345
itself and there's a great
visualization for doing this,

190
00:08:27.345 --> 00:08:28.815
it's called a card,

191
00:08:28.815 --> 00:08:31.710
so come up to
visualizations and select

192
00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:34.170
card and just see it

193
00:08:34.170 --> 00:08:37.110
changes to just give
us the actual number.

194
00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:38.775
I'm going to resize that,

195
00:08:38.775 --> 00:08:43.690
drag and drop it onto my banner.

196
00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:47.895
You can use your arrow
keys to reposition.

197
00:08:47.895 --> 00:08:51.345
The black on the dark blue
is quite hard to read.

198
00:08:51.345 --> 00:08:53.520
Now we need to make
a bit of a change to

199
00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:55.800
some of the properties
of that visualizations.

200
00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.360
To do that, we're
going to come back

201
00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.950
to our visualizations panel,

202
00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:01.140
and under the visuals
themselves you'll see

203
00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:03.870
a button format looks like
a little paint brush.

204
00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:06.510
We're going to click
on the Format and what

205
00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:09.195
we need to do is
change the data label,

206
00:09:09.195 --> 00:09:11.430
and I'm going to
make that white to

207
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:14.620
see there are loads of options
you can change in here.

208
00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:17.730
Nice and easy to read.

209
00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:21.075
I don't have to repeat that
process three more times.

210
00:09:21.075 --> 00:09:23.025
I can just copy
paste this visual,

211
00:09:23.025 --> 00:09:25.470
so just make sure it's
selected and then

212
00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:29.230
Control C and Control V twice.

213
00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:33.200
Then grabbing the one
you added most recently,

214
00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:35.510
we're going to click and
drag it to the other side of

215
00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:38.405
the banner and you see
those red dotted lines?

216
00:09:38.405 --> 00:09:41.390
Those are Intelliguides that
help you line your visuals

217
00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:44.650
up with other visuals
nearby. Really handy.

218
00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:47.050
I'm going to do the same
with the middle one,

219
00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:50.075
just making sure that's
nicely lined up.

220
00:09:50.075 --> 00:09:53.160
Then all we need to do
is swap out the metrics.

221
00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:55.355
Back in the visualizations pane,

222
00:09:55.355 --> 00:09:57.439
can you switch back to fields?

223
00:09:57.439 --> 00:10:00.550
We're going to remove
orders and add revenue.

224
00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:02.880
Then for the last
one, we can remove

225
00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:06.350
orders and add items sold.

226
00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:08.770
Clicking away, you can see.

227
00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:10.630
That's looking really good.

228
00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:13.045
If we wanted to see
the same metrics

229
00:10:13.045 --> 00:10:14.990
on our other report page,

230
00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:16.420
same as we did before.

231
00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:17.995
Holding "Control down".

232
00:10:17.995 --> 00:10:21.665
I'm going to select all
three, "Control C".

233
00:10:21.665 --> 00:10:27.950
Click on sales trends and
"Control V". Too easy.

234
00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:30.440
I'm back in my sales report

235
00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:33.520
and there's one last
thing we're going to do.

236
00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:36.100
There is a fantastic selection of

237
00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:38.485
visualizations
right-hand Power BI.

238
00:10:38.485 --> 00:10:40.600
But if none of those
meet your needs,

239
00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:42.965
there are actually an
increasing number of

240
00:10:42.965 --> 00:10:45.230
third party visuals that you can

241
00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:47.915
download directly
from Microsoft Store

242
00:10:47.915 --> 00:10:51.245
or from Power BI itself.

243
00:10:51.245 --> 00:10:53.570
To get them from Power BI,

244
00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:56.025
we're going to come to
our visualizations panel,

245
00:10:56.025 --> 00:10:58.015
click the three little dots.

246
00:10:58.015 --> 00:11:02.525
The top option will allow us
to go direct to get them.

247
00:11:02.525 --> 00:11:05.075
If you have downloaded
them from the store,

248
00:11:05.075 --> 00:11:07.270
you'll just need to
click import a visual.

249
00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:10.040
We're going to click
get more visuals.

250
00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:13.915
At this point you may
be prompted to sign-in.

251
00:11:13.915 --> 00:11:16.105
You'll need to provide
your Microsoft

252
00:11:16.105 --> 00:11:18.040
Sign-in for either
your user account

253
00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:19.450
or your education count.

254
00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:20.960
For more information on that,

255
00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:22.750
check out the toolbox.

256
00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:25.135
Now, in this search box,

257
00:11:25.135 --> 00:11:27.250
we can search for
particular visual or you

258
00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:29.470
can just scan through and
see what's out there.

259
00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:31.789
We're actually looking for
something quite specific.

260
00:11:31.789 --> 00:11:34.250
We'd like to add a violin plot.

261
00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:36.860
I'm going to type in violin

262
00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:40.905
and press "Enter" to
search. There it is.

263
00:11:40.905 --> 00:11:42.280
Now to add it, all I need to

264
00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:44.830
do is click the "Add" button.

265
00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:47.170
It's going to double-check

266
00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:49.670
and I'm going to say,
yes, that's great.

267
00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:51.970
If you have a look
in your panel now,

268
00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:53.770
you'll see a new visualization

269
00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:55.795
has been added called
a violin plot.

270
00:11:55.795 --> 00:11:57.835
We better make a bit
of space for this guy.

271
00:11:57.835 --> 00:12:03.040
I'm going to just
shrink down my treemap.

272
00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:06.395
Then I'm going to
pop my violin chart.

273
00:12:06.395 --> 00:12:09.180
Let's just pop that in here.

274
00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:17.090
If you've never come across
a violin chart before,

275
00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:19.565
there is a bit more
information again in

276
00:12:19.565 --> 00:12:22.685
the toolbox that you can
read up a bit about it.

277
00:12:22.685 --> 00:12:25.090
But put simply, it will allow us

278
00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:27.520
to present statistical
information

279
00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:29.710
called long statistical
information in a

280
00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:32.695
very easy to understand way.

281
00:12:32.695 --> 00:12:36.265
What we'd like to see is
some statistics around

282
00:12:36.265 --> 00:12:40.630
how the different subcategories
of items are selling.

283
00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:43.705
First thing I'm going to
do is in my fields panel,

284
00:12:43.705 --> 00:12:45.620
I'm going to come
down to products

285
00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:47.080
because that's going
to tell me about

286
00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:51.875
my subcategory and I'm going
to select subcategory.

287
00:12:51.875 --> 00:12:54.245
It's just telling me
that it's going to use

288
00:12:54.245 --> 00:12:56.620
that information as my sampling,

289
00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:59.135
but now I need the
actual measurement.

290
00:12:59.135 --> 00:13:03.040
For that we're going
to use items sold.

291
00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:05.290
How many items were
actually sold?

292
00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:06.895
Can you just select that?

293
00:13:06.895 --> 00:13:08.860
Finally, we'd also like to add

294
00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:12.190
a category and this is going
to be our fiscal year.

295
00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:17.635
If you can come up to Calendar
and select fiscal year.

296
00:13:17.635 --> 00:13:20.725
Now, you see why it's
called a violin plot.

297
00:13:20.725 --> 00:13:23.525
Now, if you hover over one
of the little violins,

298
00:13:23.525 --> 00:13:25.810
you will see it's
telling me the min,

299
00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:26.920
the max, the median,

300
00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:29.165
the mean and the
standard deviation.

301
00:13:29.165 --> 00:13:30.760
To understand a little better,

302
00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:34.270
picture it as a
histogram on its side.

303
00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:37.600
This is telling me
that the most of

304
00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:40.940
the subcategories sold
about 2,000 items,

305
00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:43.840
but there were a few
in 2019 that actually

306
00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:47.440
sold nearly 20,000 items.

307
00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:50.565
Just like we saw with the
other visualizations.

308
00:13:50.565 --> 00:13:53.124
Third-party visuals
can be formatted.

309
00:13:53.124 --> 00:13:54.829
With it's still selected,

310
00:13:54.829 --> 00:13:59.105
I'm going to come over to my
paint brush, my format tool.

311
00:13:59.105 --> 00:14:02.785
I'm going to come
down to data colors.

312
00:14:02.785 --> 00:14:06.020
I want each category
to be its own color.

313
00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:08.860
I'm going to turn that on
and then I'm going to change

314
00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:12.775
my transparency to zero so
they look a little brighter.

315
00:14:12.775 --> 00:14:16.370
There's my finished violin plot.

316
00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:20.335
We still have one
empty space left.

317
00:14:20.335 --> 00:14:22.170
That's your homework challenge.

318
00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:25.440
I'd like you to create
an appropriate visual to

319
00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:29.700
show the breakdown of
sales by category.

320
00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:31.745
When you're done, join us for

321
00:14:31.745 --> 00:14:33.490
our next video where we start

322
00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:35.035
looking at some of the tools for

323
00:14:35.035 --> 00:14:37.990
working with our reports.
