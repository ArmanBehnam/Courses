[MUSIC]

2
00:00:05.315 --> 00:00:07.344
Welcome back.

3
00:00:07.344 --> 00:00:11.944
In this video, we're going to start
introducing Power BI desktop.

4
00:00:11.944 --> 00:00:16.540
We're going to see how we can use it
to get transform and model our data.

5
00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:20.561
We're then going to start building some
amazing interactive visualizations.

6
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.430
When you first open up Power BI desktop,
you'll be greeted with this friendly

7
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.180
yellow start screen, which allows you to
quickly get data or open recent reports.

8
00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:32.910
But for now,
we're just going to close it up.

9
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.140
So just hit the cross top right hand
corner and welcome to Power BI desktop.

10
00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.801
Unlike Excel, when you open up Power BI,

11
00:00:41.801 --> 00:00:44.701
you just confronted
with this white canvas.

12
00:00:44.701 --> 00:00:49.918
But that's because this tool is not
designed for data entry, it's designed for

13
00:00:49.918 --> 00:00:53.998
creating reports, and
a white canvas is exactly what we need.

14
00:00:53.998 --> 00:00:58.249
Before we can do that though,
we're going to need to get some data.

15
00:00:58.249 --> 00:01:02.208
And Power BI offers us
a huge a range of options.

16
00:01:02.208 --> 00:01:04.844
If you come to get data
button on the ribbon,

17
00:01:04.844 --> 00:01:07.492
you'll see some more common data sources.

18
00:01:07.492 --> 00:01:12.482
But at the bottom, select the more
button and prepare to be amazed

19
00:01:12.482 --> 00:01:17.380
because not only can you get it
from just about any database, but

20
00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.301
you can get it from online services,
Salesforce, you name it.

21
00:01:22.301 --> 00:01:25.955
We're just going to get our data from
Excel though, so I'm going to click

22
00:01:25.955 --> 00:01:29.617
Cancel, and then coming back to my ribbon,
I'm going to click Excel.

23
00:01:29.617 --> 00:01:34.155
Can you navigate where you've downloaded
this week's files and you're looking for

24
00:01:34.155 --> 00:01:36.751
week four data and
we're going to double-click.

25
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.860
And this screen probably
looks quite familiar.

26
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.063
It's our old friend Power Query.

27
00:01:43.063 --> 00:01:48.030
And it's asking us which tables or
worksheets we want to get our data from,

28
00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.792
while we want to get it from
the five tables at the top, so

29
00:01:51.792 --> 00:01:55.661
just select everything from
customer down to products.

30
00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.208
And then if you were peppy
to just load that data in,

31
00:01:59.208 --> 00:02:00.790
you could click the load button.

32
00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.836
But if you need to make some changes,

33
00:02:02.836 --> 00:02:05.616
we're going to click
the transform data button.

34
00:02:08.584 --> 00:02:13.752
This has opened up our query editor and
we now have the full

35
00:02:13.752 --> 00:02:19.740
power of power query to merge,
append, or clean up our data.

36
00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.946
We're going to keep it
really simple though,

37
00:02:21.946 --> 00:02:25.232
we're just going to make a few
transformations to our staff table.

38
00:02:25.232 --> 00:02:28.415
So can you select LKP staff.

39
00:02:28.415 --> 00:02:31.297
And the first thing we're
going to do is fix that name.

40
00:02:31.297 --> 00:02:34.794
It's quite common for
tables to have TBL, or DIM, or

41
00:02:34.794 --> 00:02:38.990
fact in front of them, but
when they're brought into Power BI,

42
00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:43.080
it's good practice to keep as
names as sensible as possible.

43
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.471
So, clicking into the name
box on the right hand side,

44
00:02:46.471 --> 00:02:50.251
I'm just going to backspace to
remove the LKP and press Enter.

45
00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.362
Another really good idea is to try and

46
00:02:54.362 --> 00:02:58.240
keep your data model in
Power BI as lean as possible.

47
00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.190
So don't pull in columns or
records you don't need.

48
00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.184
There's a lot of employee information
that we do not need for our analysis, so

49
00:03:06.184 --> 00:03:08.314
I'm going to remove them from the query.

50
00:03:08.314 --> 00:03:10.718
They'll still be in
the original data source,

51
00:03:10.718 --> 00:03:12.831
they just won't be pulled into Power BI.

52
00:03:12.831 --> 00:03:16.487
We're going to start by clicking
on national ID number, and

53
00:03:16.487 --> 00:03:20.073
then I'm going to scroll to
the right till I SickLeaveHours,

54
00:03:20.073 --> 00:03:24.160
hold my shift key down, and
select the SickLeaveHours column, and

55
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.983
then just press Delete to remove
those columns from the query.

56
00:03:27.983 --> 00:03:31.106
I also don't need all my staff,
this analysis,

57
00:03:31.106 --> 00:03:34.040
I'm only interested in sales staff.

58
00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.735
So I'm going to come to
my department column,

59
00:03:37.735 --> 00:03:42.500
click the drop down, uncheck all,
and just select Sales.

60
00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.940
So I'm filtering out
everything that's not sales.

61
00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.953
They're my sales staff, and
that's my transformation complete.

62
00:03:50.953 --> 00:03:55.438
Now I'm going to come to my home
ribbon and click close and apply, and

63
00:03:55.438 --> 00:03:58.643
that's going to finish
the transformation and

64
00:03:58.643 --> 00:04:01.700
load all the data into
my Power BI data model.

65
00:04:04.786 --> 00:04:09.440
The data is now being loaded, but
we can't see it in the report view.

66
00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.774
So to actually see the data, we're
going to come to the left hand side and

67
00:04:13.774 --> 00:04:16.477
there's a small panel with three icons,
and

68
00:04:16.477 --> 00:04:19.709
the second icon gives us
access to the data view.

69
00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.107
Let's click on that now.

70
00:04:21.107 --> 00:04:24.024
And you can see there's my customer table.

71
00:04:24.024 --> 00:04:27.412
And on the right hand side are all
my other tables listed, and

72
00:04:27.412 --> 00:04:30.682
if I wanted to see orders,
I can click on the orders table.

73
00:04:32.153 --> 00:04:35.928
What I want to do next though,
is actually finish off the model.

74
00:04:35.928 --> 00:04:39.372
I need to create the relationships
between these tables.

75
00:04:39.372 --> 00:04:44.609
And just as we saw in Power Pivot,
this is really important in Power BI.

76
00:04:44.609 --> 00:04:49.087
So the third icon on the left
hand side is our model icon.

77
00:04:49.087 --> 00:04:52.154
And we going to click on
that to see our data model.

78
00:04:53.548 --> 00:04:56.770
On the right hand side are two panels,
the fields panel,

79
00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.532
which shows us which feels on each
table and the properties panel,

80
00:05:00.532 --> 00:05:03.100
which we're going to
look at a little later.

81
00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.940
But for now, let's tuck that
away to give us some more space.

82
00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:11.837
And then we're going to click the minus
on our zoom slider a few times, just so

83
00:05:11.837 --> 00:05:14.440
we can see all the tables.

84
00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.765
So there are five tables, but notice a lot
of the relationships have been created for

85
00:05:19.765 --> 00:05:22.180
us, which is absolutely brilliant.

86
00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:26.195
And if I come and hover over the
relationship between customer and orders,

87
00:05:26.195 --> 00:05:31.040
you can see it's related the customer ID,
so that's work beautifully.

88
00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.763
Let's do what we did last week.

89
00:05:33.763 --> 00:05:37.154
Let's organize our table, so
all our look up tables at the top and

90
00:05:37.154 --> 00:05:38.767
our fact tables at the bottom.

91
00:05:38.767 --> 00:05:41.648
So I'm going to move orders down and

92
00:05:41.648 --> 00:05:45.499
Order_Items which these
are our fact tables.

93
00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:52.440
And then I'm going to move products,
staff, and customer into the top row.

94
00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.631
I'm leaving a little
space on the left there.

95
00:05:55.631 --> 00:05:59.840
And we can now see that there
is one relationship missing.

96
00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.273
We're missing the relationship
between staff and orders.

97
00:06:03.273 --> 00:06:07.661
So we can't get any more
information about our sales person.

98
00:06:07.661 --> 00:06:11.954
The reason for that is, that the fields
have different names on the two tables,

99
00:06:11.954 --> 00:06:14.134
so on the staff table it's employee ID,

100
00:06:14.134 --> 00:06:17.035
on the orders table we've
called it sales person ID.

101
00:06:17.035 --> 00:06:19.132
So if you can be
consistent in your naming,

102
00:06:19.132 --> 00:06:21.305
you will save yourself
a little bit of time.

103
00:06:21.305 --> 00:06:23.670
But it's very easy to
create the relationship.

104
00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:24.796
Let's put that in now.

105
00:06:24.796 --> 00:06:29.090
I'm going to click on employee ID,
drag and drop onto Sales Person ID.

106
00:06:31.463 --> 00:06:34.219
And that has created my relationship.

107
00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:38.168
The data were working with is very much
the same data's we looked at last week.

108
00:06:38.168 --> 00:06:41.575
But let's just take a moment to remind
ourselves what it looks like and

109
00:06:41.575 --> 00:06:42.913
where it's being stored.

110
00:06:44.671 --> 00:06:47.761
At the heart of our data
set is the orders table.

111
00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:51.968
This is where we store each
order that has been placed.

112
00:06:51.968 --> 00:06:56.153
So for example, order 43660 was placed on

113
00:06:56.153 --> 00:07:00.973
the second off July and
was placed by customer 117.

114
00:07:00.973 --> 00:07:05.778
To find out more about the customer,
we can go to the customer table and

115
00:07:05.778 --> 00:07:08.722
we can see that that was Pedals Warehouse.

116
00:07:08.722 --> 00:07:13.430
The sales person who took
the order was Linda Mitchell.

117
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:16.938
And we can see we've got that
relationship between employee ID and

118
00:07:16.938 --> 00:07:20.140
sales person ID to get
that extra information.

119
00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:23.597
The order actually
consisted of two products.

120
00:07:23.597 --> 00:07:27.697
And the details of which
items were purchased within

121
00:07:27.697 --> 00:07:31.700
order are stored on the order items table.

122
00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:36.864
The two products purchased were a road for
50 and a road 650.

123
00:07:36.864 --> 00:07:41.521
On the order_items table,
we have also the order quantity.

124
00:07:41.521 --> 00:07:45.687
So how many of each product were
purchased and the unit price.

125
00:07:45.687 --> 00:07:51.640
The line table then gives us the total
spent for each product for that order.

126
00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:54.884
If we add up our line totals for
a particular order,

127
00:07:54.884 --> 00:07:59.040
they will equal the subtotal
on the orders table.

128
00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:03.451
So either sub total or
line total will give us our revenue.

129
00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.290
So that's a quick recap on the data.

130
00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:10.971
We're now ready to start
building our visualizations.

131
00:08:10.971 --> 00:08:14.438
Back in Power BI,
come to the left hand panel, and

132
00:08:14.438 --> 00:08:19.651
we're going to select our report icon
of the top to come back to our canvas.

133
00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:25.263
The first visualization we'd like
to build is to see how much revenue

134
00:08:25.263 --> 00:08:27.740
was produced by each state.

135
00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:31.108
So we're going to start by coming
across to the right hand side and

136
00:08:31.108 --> 00:08:32.893
you'll see we have three panels.

137
00:08:32.893 --> 00:08:36.258
A filters panel, which we're
going to leave collapsed for now.

138
00:08:36.258 --> 00:08:42.205
A visualizations panel which allows us to
select and customize our visualizations.

139
00:08:42.205 --> 00:08:47.122
And the fields pane, which works very
much like the fields pain in pivot tables

140
00:08:47.122 --> 00:08:52.640
in that it lets us choose which fields
we want to add to our visualization.

141
00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:53.701
Now we need state.

142
00:08:53.701 --> 00:08:58.240
So I'm going to come to customer and
click on the drop down to expand it.

143
00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:01.883
And then I'm going to find state,
click, drag, and

144
00:09:01.883 --> 00:09:06.483
actually drop it onto the bottom
left hand corner off my canvas.

145
00:09:06.483 --> 00:09:12.354
Power BI has automatically detected that
that is geographical information and

146
00:09:12.354 --> 00:09:14.220
has created a map for me.

147
00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:15.251
How good is that?

148
00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:20.388
To resize our visualization, we can use
the resize handles at the corners and

149
00:09:20.388 --> 00:09:23.451
mid points, so I'm going to make
my map a little bit bigger.

150
00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:28.200
But now I'd also like to
see a breakdown by revenue.

151
00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.356
So that's just show me
where the states are,

152
00:09:30.356 --> 00:09:34.640
but not given me any indication of
how much revenues being produced.

153
00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:38.358
If I come to my fields list again and
expand order items,

154
00:09:38.358 --> 00:09:42.312
there's our line total,
which will give us our revenue and

155
00:09:42.312 --> 00:09:45.980
I could drag that and
drop it onto the visualization.

156
00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:50.723
But one of the things we learned last
week was that it's always better to use

157
00:09:50.723 --> 00:09:53.810
an explicit measure than
an implicit measure and

158
00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:56.940
that is definitely true in Power BI.

159
00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:58.692
So we're going to do it right.

160
00:09:58.692 --> 00:10:02.230
Now if you, still a little
shaky about what a measure is,

161
00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:07.024
I'll just remind you, it's basically
a metric, something like revenue,

162
00:10:07.024 --> 00:10:09.549
which can be seen in different context.

163
00:10:09.549 --> 00:10:14.940
So I could have revenue by country, or
revenue by year, or revenue by product.

164
00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:15.859
In every case,

165
00:10:15.859 --> 00:10:21.240
it's an aggregation of a particular
field within a particular context.

166
00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:25.593
To create the measure, we can either
right click on order items or

167
00:10:25.593 --> 00:10:29.251
we can come up to our ribbon and
just click new measure.

168
00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:37.840
When we do, the formula bar opens up,
and now we can just type in our measure.

169
00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:41.438
The first thing we put is what
we want to call the measure and

170
00:10:41.438 --> 00:10:43.063
I want to call it Revenue.

171
00:10:43.063 --> 00:10:48.010
We then type of space and an equals, and
that is slightly different to Power Pivot.

172
00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:51.300
We don't put the colon, so
slightly more intuitive.

173
00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:56.511
Then type another space, and now we need
to specify the calculation we want to do,

174
00:10:56.511 --> 00:10:58.580
which in this case, is a sum.

175
00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:02.853
So I'm going to type sum and
open my brackets.

176
00:11:02.853 --> 00:11:05.853
This however is not an Excel sum.

177
00:11:05.853 --> 00:11:10.417
The language we use for
doing our calculations and Power BI is and

178
00:11:10.417 --> 00:11:13.256
what we're trying to add
up is our line total.

179
00:11:13.256 --> 00:11:15.360
So I'm going to start
typing line total and

180
00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:17.450
you see the auto complete is really good.

181
00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:22.246
There it is, Order_Items LineTotal,
tab to select,

182
00:11:22.246 --> 00:11:25.418
close your bracket and press enter.

183
00:11:25.418 --> 00:11:30.551
If you have a look in your fields list,
a new measure called Revenue has

184
00:11:30.551 --> 00:11:35.961
been added and it gets a little calculator
icon to tell us it's a measure.

185
00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:41.440
As we could empower Pivot,
we can also change the formatting.

186
00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:45.974
So with that still selected,
come up to your rhythm and

187
00:11:45.974 --> 00:11:50.904
with this format,
we're going to change it to currency and

188
00:11:50.904 --> 00:11:54.072
I want that with zero decimal places.

189
00:11:54.072 --> 00:11:57.371
Our new measure's now being created and

190
00:11:57.371 --> 00:12:02.440
we can use that in any or
all of our visualizations.

191
00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:05.197
I'm going to come to revenue,
click, drag, and

192
00:12:05.197 --> 00:12:08.951
I'm going to drop it into the size
field in my visualizations pane.

193
00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:14.763
And to see each of the bubbles has now
changed size to reflect the comparative

194
00:12:14.763 --> 00:12:15.351
revenue.

195
00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:19.082
One last thing I'd like
to do in this chart,

196
00:12:19.082 --> 00:12:22.740
I'd actually like to color
code the bubbles by country.

197
00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:26.960
So again, in my fields pain, I'm going
to come to customer, locate country.

198
00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:30.161
And this time I'm just going to
put a tick in the box and

199
00:12:30.161 --> 00:12:34.051
you'll see another way off
adding field to a visualization.

200
00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:40.540
Let's create one more, and this time
what we want to do is a tree map.

201
00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:43.830
Now you may recall trying to do tree
maps with pivot tables was a bit of

202
00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:47.040
a challenge, but in Power BI,
it couldn't be easier.

203
00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:51.120
Make sure you've clicked away from your
visualizations, so just click into canvas.

204
00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:54.051
We're going to come back
to visualizations, and

205
00:12:54.051 --> 00:12:57.957
in this selection of charts,
we're going to choose tree map, and

206
00:12:57.957 --> 00:13:00.780
that's going to put an empty
tree map in for us.

207
00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:05.571
I'm just going to move that down to
be next to my map, and for this one,

208
00:13:05.571 --> 00:13:09.370
I would like to see a breakdown
of revenue by country.

209
00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:14.767
So in my field list, I'm just going to
select country and revenue, really easy,

210
00:13:14.767 --> 00:13:19.490
and you'll see because I'm using
sensible table names and measures.

211
00:13:19.490 --> 00:13:23.719
I get sensible names for my visualization,
so I don't need to rename them,

212
00:13:23.719 --> 00:13:25.440
which is great.

213
00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:28.140
But here's the best part.

214
00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:34.278
Come over to the United States block
in your tree map and click to select.

215
00:13:34.278 --> 00:13:39.823
You'll notice it has now filtered our
map to show us only states in the US.

216
00:13:39.823 --> 00:13:43.008
To clear the filter,
just click on United States again, and

217
00:13:43.008 --> 00:13:45.014
we can even do it the other way around.

218
00:13:45.014 --> 00:13:50.160
So if I come into my map and I click
on California, which is the big bubble,

219
00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:55.397
it is now showing me the total amount
of revenue that came from California.

220
00:13:55.397 --> 00:13:59.380
And again to clear it,
just click anywhere in your map.

221
00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:03.409
So in just a few minutes,
we have imported, transformed, and

222
00:14:03.409 --> 00:14:09.140
modeled our data, and created two
fantastic interactive visualizations.

223
00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:13.641
We still have one table missing from our
data model, and that's the calendar table,

224
00:14:13.641 --> 00:14:16.600
and that's what we're going to
look at in the next video.

225
00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:19.370
But for now,
let's make sure we've saved our work.

226
00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:21.940
So we're going to click our file tab.

227
00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:24.069
We're going to click Save as.

228
00:14:24.069 --> 00:14:29.330
You can navigate wherever you want to
save this file, and I'm going to call

229
00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:34.870
it Sales Report 1, and you'll notice
it saves it with the extension PBIX.

230
00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:37.526
Otherwise, it's just like any other file.

231
00:14:37.526 --> 00:14:40.903
And we're now going the click
Save button and we're done.

232
00:14:40.903 --> 00:14:41.403
[SOUND]
