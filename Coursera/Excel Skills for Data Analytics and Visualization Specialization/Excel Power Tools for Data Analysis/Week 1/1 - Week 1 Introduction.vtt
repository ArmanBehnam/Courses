00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:08.280
Welcome to Excel Power
Tools for Data Analysis.

2
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.625
This is the third and final
course in the Specialization,

3
00:00:11.625 --> 00:00:15.225
Excel Skills for Data
Analytics and Visualization.

4
00:00:15.225 --> 00:00:19.130
This is where it gets really
exciting as we start using

5
00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.050
some really powerful tools to

6
00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.005
transform and analyze our data.

7
00:00:24.005 --> 00:00:26.510
The typical data
analysis workflow

8
00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.805
can be divided into three phases.

9
00:00:28.805 --> 00:00:31.655
First, we have to get
and prepare our data,

10
00:00:31.655 --> 00:00:33.275
a bit like cooking a nice meal,

11
00:00:33.275 --> 00:00:34.790
where the first
stage is to source

12
00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.640
the right ingredients and
then clean and prepare them.

13
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.460
The second phase is
the analysis itself,

14
00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.425
where we slice and dice the data,

15
00:00:42.425 --> 00:00:43.925
combine the right metrics,

16
00:00:43.925 --> 00:00:45.800
add some imaginative seasoning

17
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.810
to extract the right flavors.

18
00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.665
The final phase is to present
and share our analysis,

19
00:00:51.665 --> 00:00:54.814
plate it up in an attractive
way to be consumed.

20
00:00:54.814 --> 00:00:57.770
Excel's ease and
flexibility often make

21
00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.130
it the tool of choice
for doing data analysis,

22
00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:02.915
but it does have some
inherent limitations.

23
00:01:02.915 --> 00:01:04.280
Whether data comes from

24
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.360
an external source like
a text file or database,

25
00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.590
it has to be imported into Excel,

26
00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.025
which can be a repetitive
and tedious process.

27
00:01:13.025 --> 00:01:15.020
Often the data will
need to be cleaned,

28
00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.865
modified, and integrated,

29
00:01:16.865 --> 00:01:18.335
which again can be repetitive,

30
00:01:18.335 --> 00:01:21.475
time-consuming, and
potentially error-prone.

31
00:01:21.475 --> 00:01:23.630
Then, of course, truly big data

32
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.610
simply does not fit
in a spreadsheet,

33
00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.550
which can only store just
over a million rows.

34
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:30.260
Over the last few years,

35
00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:31.730
Microsoft had been working on

36
00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.270
transforming the end-to-end
experience for analysts.

37
00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.390
Excel has undergone
a major upgrade

38
00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.115
with inclusion of Power
Query and Power Pivot.

39
00:01:42.115 --> 00:01:44.680
Power Query, integrated
into the ribbon from

40
00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.500
2016 as Get and Transform,

41
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.540
was designed to
help analysts with

42
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.055
the initial phases
of the workflow,

43
00:01:52.055 --> 00:01:54.135
to fetch data from
different sources,

44
00:01:54.135 --> 00:01:57.420
and then clean and
transform it for analysis.

45
00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.190
Power Pivot is an
Excel add-in that

46
00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.460
revolutionizes the second
phase, the actual analysis.

47
00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.050
Power Pivot provides us with

48
00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.150
an analytical database inside

49
00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.170
the Excel workbook capable
of storing millions of rows.

50
00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.750
Data tables in Power
Pivot can be linked,

51
00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.430
meaning we no longer
need thousands

52
00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.350
of cumbersome lookup functions.

53
00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.420
Power Pivot introduces

54
00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.700
a powerful modeling
language called

55
00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.500
DAX which allows us to

56
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.440
perform advanced
analytics on our data.

57
00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.570
Over the course of
the next few weeks,

58
00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.100
we're going to get, clean, and

59
00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.440
transform our data
with Power Query,

60
00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.205
analyze our data with
Power Pivot in DAX,

61
00:02:35.205 --> 00:02:36.790
and then in the final week,

62
00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.250
we see how these same
technologies have been

63
00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.925
incorporated into another
power tool called Power BI,

64
00:02:42.925 --> 00:02:45.460
which we will use for
the final phase of

65
00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.220
presenting and
sharing our analysis.

66
00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.920
Please note that Power
Query, Power Pivot,

67
00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.675
and Power BI desktop are

68
00:02:52.675 --> 00:02:54.865
only available on the
Windows platform.

69
00:02:54.865 --> 00:02:57.020
Mac users will require Boot Camp,

70
00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.080
running Windows or
a virtual machine

71
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.920
with a Windows operating system.

72
00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.610
Power Query comes standard
with 2016 onwards and

73
00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.345
can be downloaded for
2010 and 2013 Pro Plus,

74
00:03:08.345 --> 00:03:09.650
but we would recommend for

75
00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.335
this course that you
have 2016 or later.

76
00:03:12.335 --> 00:03:15.815
This week, we will introduce
you to Power Query.

77
00:03:15.815 --> 00:03:18.035
We will look at how
we can use it to

78
00:03:18.035 --> 00:03:20.045
get data from a range of sources,

79
00:03:20.045 --> 00:03:22.370
how it can be used
to append rows from

80
00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.745
two or more similarly
structured data sets,

81
00:03:25.745 --> 00:03:27.860
and how we can use
merge queries to

82
00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.485
combine columns from
different tables.

83
00:03:30.485 --> 00:03:32.720
We have eight great videos

84
00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.160
to guide you through the process,

85
00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.980
and we strongly encourage
you to work along with us.

86
00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.690
Download this week's exercise

87
00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.400
files and let's get started.
