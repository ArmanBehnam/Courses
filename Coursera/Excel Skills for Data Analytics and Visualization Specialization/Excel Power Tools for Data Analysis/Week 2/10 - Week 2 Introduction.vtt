00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:08.190
Last week, we focused
on using Power Query to

2
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:09.690
get and integrate data from

3
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.700
a variety of different sources.

4
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.770
This week, we will focus on

5
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:15.900
getting more familiar
with Query Editor

6
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.430
and seeing how we can use it to

7
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.280
perform data
transformation operations.

8
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.750
We're going to start by taking

9
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.940
some data that would
usually require a lot

10
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.410
of manual work to get into

11
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.975
a form that could be
used for analysis.

12
00:00:27.975 --> 00:00:30.510
We're then going to use
Power Query to apply

13
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.050
transformations like filtering
out unnecessary rows,

14
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.850
removing duplicates,
and filling in

15
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.285
the blanks to get the data
into a usable format.

16
00:00:39.285 --> 00:00:41.350
To complete the transformation,

17
00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.790
we will see how Power
Query can perform

18
00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.780
the amazing time-saving task
of unpivoting our data.

19
00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.445
As the name suggests,

20
00:00:49.445 --> 00:00:51.350
unpivoting data is

21
00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.065
the reverse operation
of pivoting data.

22
00:00:54.065 --> 00:00:55.370
When we pivot data,

23
00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.650
we take every unique
occurrence of value in

24
00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.155
a column and turn
it into a heading,

25
00:01:00.155 --> 00:01:02.075
creating a short fat table,

26
00:01:02.075 --> 00:01:04.265
which can be good to
present in a report.

27
00:01:04.265 --> 00:01:06.410
When we unpivot, we take

28
00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:07.730
those headings and turn them

29
00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:09.455
back into values within a column,

30
00:01:09.455 --> 00:01:11.345
creating a long skinny table

31
00:01:11.345 --> 00:01:13.564
more suitable for doing analysis.

32
00:01:13.564 --> 00:01:16.475
We will also look at how
we can use Power Query

33
00:01:16.475 --> 00:01:19.580
to pivot and group
data and as we go,

34
00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.170
we will look at some
common errors that

35
00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.175
occur and how to troubleshoot
and correct them.

36
00:01:24.175 --> 00:01:26.080
We wrap up the week by looking at

37
00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.970
some fantastic new features

38
00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.175
for transforming columns of data.

39
00:01:30.175 --> 00:01:32.965
Because some of these are
not available in 2016,

40
00:01:32.965 --> 00:01:35.680
we've actually provided two
videos for the last topic,

41
00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.734
one to show the new features,

42
00:01:37.734 --> 00:01:41.685
and one showing good
work-arounds for 2016 users.

43
00:01:41.685 --> 00:01:43.830
We actually recommend
watching both.

44
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.835
To summarize, this week,

45
00:01:45.835 --> 00:01:47.680
we will cover the
following topics,

46
00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.500
applying a range of
transformations,

47
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.610
unpivoting data, pivoting
data in the Query Editor,

48
00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.475
grouping data, and finally,

49
00:01:57.475 --> 00:01:59.890
working with columns
and calculations.

50
00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.545
It's going to be another
action-packed week.

51
00:02:02.545 --> 00:02:07.100
Download those exercise
files and let's get started.
