00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:06.660
In the previous weeks,

2
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.450
we saw how we could get
clean and transform

3
00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.490
our data preparing
our ingredients

4
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.110
so it's ready to be analyzed.

5
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.690
This week we spoke
up the heat and get

6
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.275
cooking as we move to the
actual analysis phase;

7
00:00:19.275 --> 00:00:22.680
drawing useful metrics
and intel from the data.

8
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.355
This phase, we will introduce
another power tool called

9
00:00:26.355 --> 00:00:28.320
Power Pivot that will address

10
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.230
a lot of the limitations
of regular Excel.

11
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.570
What is Power Pivot?

12
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.500
Power Pivot is an Excel add-in
that allows us to perform

13
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.720
sophisticated data analysis on

14
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.535
millions of rows of
data within Excel.

15
00:00:42.535 --> 00:00:45.120
Once enabled, you
would be able to

16
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.480
pull huge data sets
from a range of

17
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.255
sources into the Power
Pivot data model

18
00:00:50.255 --> 00:00:53.795
and create relationships
between those data sets.

19
00:00:53.795 --> 00:00:55.520
We can analyze data from

20
00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.010
multiple sources without the need

21
00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.915
for thousands of look-ups.

22
00:00:59.915 --> 00:01:03.830
Power Pivot also introduces
a new language for

23
00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.540
performing our data
analysis called DAX.

24
00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.640
DAX stands for data
analysis expressions

25
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.790
and vastly increases
our analysis options,

26
00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.829
solving problems we previously

27
00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:17.890
wouldn't even have attempted.

28
00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.190
To get the most on a power pivot,

29
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.300
we do need to understand a
bit about data modeling.

30
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.460
If you're coming from
a SQL background,

31
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.335
these concepts will be familiar.

32
00:01:27.335 --> 00:01:30.110
But if coming from
an Excel background,

33
00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.000
this will probably be quite new.

34
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.550
Let's take a moment to understand

35
00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.900
the theory of data modeling
and how to go about it.

36
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.520
A data model describes
information in

37
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.650
a systematic way
that allows it to

38
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.440
be stored and
retrieved efficiently.

39
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.875
The process of data modeling
involves identifying

40
00:01:48.875 --> 00:01:53.350
entities or tables and the
relationships between them.

41
00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.500
For example, let's say we
want to store sales data.

42
00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.720
We would need to
start by identifying

43
00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.800
the tables we want to
store our data in.

44
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.590
Unlike traditional
Excel where we'll

45
00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.915
often put it all
in one huge table,

46
00:02:07.915 --> 00:02:09.910
what we want to do is group data

47
00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.885
logically to avoid duplication.

48
00:02:12.885 --> 00:02:15.825
For example, we might
have a table to hold

49
00:02:15.825 --> 00:02:19.330
all our products with
details about each product.

50
00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.969
Then we'll have another
one for our customers,

51
00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:25.315
one for our salespeople and
of course most importantly,

52
00:02:25.315 --> 00:02:28.550
a table to hold all
the orders placed.

53
00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.525
In a data model, there are
two types of entities;

54
00:02:32.525 --> 00:02:35.365
data tables and lookup tables.

55
00:02:35.365 --> 00:02:38.350
Data tables, sometimes
called fact tables

56
00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.720
store the business process.

57
00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.330
In this case, our order table is

58
00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.805
a data table as it keeps
track of our sales.

59
00:02:46.805 --> 00:02:49.140
Lookup tables also called

60
00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.145
dimension tables provide
context for that business.

61
00:02:53.145 --> 00:02:56.490
For example, who bought the
item? What did they buy?

62
00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.880
Where did they buy it
and when did they buy?

63
00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.260
The customer salesperson and

64
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.380
the product tables are all
examples of lookup tables.

65
00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.550
Lookup tables tend to
grow slowly and they're

66
00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.390
usually shorter fatter
tables with lots of words.

67
00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.030
Data tables grow
more quickly and are

68
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.520
generally longer skinnier
tables with lots of numbers.

69
00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.735
Once we have identified
our entities,

70
00:03:22.735 --> 00:03:26.680
we need to tell the data
model how they are related.

71
00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.035
Taking our sales example,

72
00:03:29.035 --> 00:03:31.155
we have a customer ID which we'll

73
00:03:31.155 --> 00:03:33.620
probably record
against each order.

74
00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.505
We need to tell the data
model that the customer ID

75
00:03:37.505 --> 00:03:38.840
on the order is

76
00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.765
related to the customer
ID on the customer table.

77
00:03:41.765 --> 00:03:44.620
This is called a relationship.

78
00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.405
In data modeling,

79
00:03:46.405 --> 00:03:49.540
relationships are said
to have cardinality.

80
00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.840
Cardinality describes the type of

81
00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.245
relationship and there
are three possibilities.

82
00:03:55.245 --> 00:03:58.115
The first is a one-to-one.

83
00:03:58.115 --> 00:04:01.475
For example, country
to UN representative.

84
00:04:01.475 --> 00:04:04.580
One country can only
have one UN rep and

85
00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.940
one UN rep can only
represent one country.

86
00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.505
This is a one-to-one
relationship.

87
00:04:10.505 --> 00:04:13.255
The second type is a one to many.

88
00:04:13.255 --> 00:04:16.110
For example, financial
year to expense.

89
00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:18.815
One financial year can
have many expenses

90
00:04:18.815 --> 00:04:19.970
but an expense can only

91
00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:21.710
belong to a single
financial year,

92
00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:23.435
so one to many.

93
00:04:23.435 --> 00:04:26.785
Finally, we get a many
to many relationship.

94
00:04:26.785 --> 00:04:29.625
For example, student to class.

95
00:04:29.625 --> 00:04:33.209
One student can be in many
classes and likewise,

96
00:04:33.209 --> 00:04:35.520
a class will have many students.

97
00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.335
In our data model,

98
00:04:37.335 --> 00:04:41.010
we really only want to use
one to many relationships.

99
00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:42.890
One to one usually mean

100
00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.740
an extra table we
don't need and many to

101
00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.510
many tell us we're
trying to relate

102
00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:50.795
the wrong tables or we
have a missing entity.

103
00:04:50.795 --> 00:04:52.835
To understand this better,

104
00:04:52.835 --> 00:04:54.965
let's go and add relationships

105
00:04:54.965 --> 00:04:57.725
to the entities we
identified earlier.

106
00:04:57.725 --> 00:05:00.020
The relationship
between customer and

107
00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.180
salesperson will be many to many.

108
00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.660
We can't directly
relate these tables.

109
00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:09.110
But the relationship
between customer and order

110
00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.935
is a one to many as one customer
will place many orders,

111
00:05:12.935 --> 00:05:15.895
but a single order is only
placed by one customer.

112
00:05:15.895 --> 00:05:18.740
We link the customer ID on

113
00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:23.105
the customer table to the
customer ID on the order table.

114
00:05:23.105 --> 00:05:28.175
Customer ID is what uniquely
identifies each customer.

115
00:05:28.175 --> 00:05:30.080
This is called a primary

116
00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.200
key and it is important
in data modeling to

117
00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.630
identify the primary keys as

118
00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:38.950
these are what we use
to link our table.

119
00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:41.340
Salesperson also has a

120
00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.245
one to many relationship
with order,

121
00:05:43.245 --> 00:05:45.160
so let's link those up.

122
00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.035
What about product and order?

123
00:05:48.035 --> 00:05:51.145
What type of relationship
do you think this is?

124
00:05:51.145 --> 00:05:54.080
Obviously a particular
product may be ordered many

125
00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.235
times but also an order may
consist of many products.

126
00:05:58.235 --> 00:06:00.730
Once again, we have
a many to many.

127
00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:03.925
As there is nothing else
we can link order to,

128
00:06:03.925 --> 00:06:06.185
we must have a missing entity.

129
00:06:06.185 --> 00:06:10.450
One that tells us which
products were in each order.

130
00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:13.490
Let's add another
entity called order

131
00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:16.805
items and now we can
complete our relationships.

132
00:06:16.805 --> 00:06:19.820
One order has many
order items and

133
00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:22.745
one product can appear
in many order items,

134
00:06:22.745 --> 00:06:26.350
so the many to many is resolved.

135
00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:29.160
That is the theory.
It may seem a bit

136
00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.330
new but this week we will
have the opportunity to

137
00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.820
apply to a practical
example and see

138
00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:36.410
the amazing benefits that

139
00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:38.855
come from setting
this up correctly.

140
00:06:38.855 --> 00:06:41.630
This week we have
six power videos for

141
00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:44.419
you covering the
following topics;

142
00:06:44.419 --> 00:06:49.340
importing data into Power
Pivot, data modeling,

143
00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:52.495
analyzing data with Power Pivot,

144
00:06:52.495 --> 00:06:55.769
visualizing data
with CUBE functions,

145
00:06:55.769 --> 00:06:59.520
an introduction to
DAX measures and

146
00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:03.840
applying time intelligence
and the calculate function.

147
00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.870
This is all powerful stuff but

148
00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:09.855
a lot of the concepts
introduced maybe new.

149
00:07:09.855 --> 00:07:11.480
Take your time and

150
00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.940
where the topics are a bit
more challenging you can

151
00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:17.700
watch videos as many
times as you need.
