[MUSIC]

2
00:00:05.294 --> 00:00:07.869
In this video we continue our DAX journey,

3
00:00:07.869 --> 00:00:11.600
having a look at some of the DAX
time intelligence functions.

4
00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.762
As we saw in the previous video,
the real power and

5
00:00:16.762 --> 00:00:20.794
Power Pivot comes in when we
start using DAX measures.

6
00:00:20.794 --> 00:00:24.621
Coming back to have a look
at our DAX library again,

7
00:00:24.621 --> 00:00:29.516
if you scroll down in the list,
you will see a category called time

8
00:00:29.516 --> 00:00:35.190
intelligence functions and
now some amazing options in here.

9
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.078
Time intelligence functions allow
us to measure patterns in our

10
00:00:39.078 --> 00:00:41.380
business metrics over time.

11
00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:46.906
So for example, I might want to know,
my total at the end of the quarter,

12
00:00:46.906 --> 00:00:52.068
or I might need to know my total month
to date, or the one we're going to

13
00:00:52.068 --> 00:00:57.620
be looking at, which is what was
the same value, same period last year.

14
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.962
Before we can start using these time
intelligence functions, however,

15
00:01:02.962 --> 00:01:08.160
there's another function we need to know
about, called the calculate function.

16
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.640
And that's where we're going to start.

17
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.555
I'm back in my sales by year, and we
have a completely different requirement,

18
00:01:15.555 --> 00:01:18.580
but we're going to reuse
the same pivot table.

19
00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.133
This time what we'd like to be able to do,

20
00:01:22.133 --> 00:01:28.200
is to compare our total sales
compared to just our bike sales.

21
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.680
And we want to do this by month.

22
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.475
So on I'm going to get rid of my category.

23
00:01:33.475 --> 00:01:35.092
I'm just going to remove that, and

24
00:01:35.092 --> 00:01:37.875
I'm going to get rid of
date hierarchy as well.

25
00:01:37.875 --> 00:01:41.940
And then coming to my calendar,
I'm going to expand more items, and

26
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.781
I'm going to grab month and
drag it into rows.

27
00:01:46.362 --> 00:01:51.608
But you'll notice something quite
interesting in regular pivot tables

28
00:01:51.608 --> 00:01:56.940
it uses custom lists to sort that
has not happened in my pivot table.

29
00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.026
Now if you have the same problem,
don't worry about it.

30
00:02:00.026 --> 00:02:03.380
You're going to come to row labels,
click the drop down.

31
00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.331
Come to more sort options, and
we're going to sort ascending by month and

32
00:02:08.331 --> 00:02:10.980
then just click OK, problem solved.

33
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.522
Now I'm just going to tidy
up my chart a little bit, so

34
00:02:14.522 --> 00:02:16.510
just make it a little bit wider.

35
00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.785
We're going to put the legend at
the bottom of the chart and I'm going to

36
00:02:20.785 --> 00:02:25.700
switch off my field buttons just to
make it a little easier to work with.

37
00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.473
All right, now we don't want
our sum of all the quantity.

38
00:02:29.473 --> 00:02:33.979
We actually want to start working
without order items because we

39
00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:38.904
need to filter by category, and
there's no link between category and

40
00:02:38.904 --> 00:02:43.250
order, only between category and
order items.

41
00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:48.122
So let's start by adding a measure to make
it a little easier to work with our line

42
00:02:48.122 --> 00:02:48.641
total.

43
00:02:48.641 --> 00:02:52.042
We're going to come to
our order items table,

44
00:02:52.042 --> 00:02:57.200
right click ,add measure,
we going to call this measure, Item Total.

45
00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.860
And in our formula box, we're just
going to add up our total items.

46
00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.250
So equals sum,
open up our brackets if you just type lin.

47
00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.003
There's our order item line total and

48
00:03:13.003 --> 00:03:17.575
I'm going to close my brackets,
set it to currency and click OK.

49
00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:24.218
What we're going to do now,
is remove our sum of all the quantity and

50
00:03:24.218 --> 00:03:27.540
instead, we're going to
add our item total.

51
00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.425
So that is my total sales,
but now next to that,

52
00:03:31.425 --> 00:03:34.920
I want to see my total sales for bikes.

53
00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.124
In other words, I want to be able to
filter the data using a measure and

54
00:03:40.124 --> 00:03:44.860
the calculation going to
need is our calculate.

55
00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.370
Calculate is probably most similar
to a countifs or a sumifs.

56
00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.600
It allows us to do an aggregation and
specify the filter.

57
00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.001
What's brilliant about the calculate
is it overwrites the fields of context,

58
00:03:58.001 --> 00:04:01.650
in your pivot table,
let's have a look at how it works.

59
00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.248
So coming back to order items,
I'm going to right click, and measure and

60
00:04:06.248 --> 00:04:09.250
I'm going to call this measure,
Bike Sales.

61
00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.641
I'm going to click into my formula box,
and I'm going to type cal and

62
00:04:15.641 --> 00:04:18.440
select my calculate function.

63
00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.548
The first thing the calculate wants
is an expression which tells it

64
00:04:22.548 --> 00:04:27.190
what it's trying to aggregate and
in this case it's my Item Total.

65
00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.510
So if you just type it and select,
Item Total, nice and easy.

66
00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:39.250
Now I'm going to type a comma, the next
and the calculate needs is your filters.

67
00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.306
And you can add multiple filters,
but we're just going to add one,

68
00:04:43.306 --> 00:04:46.120
we want to filter by our lookup category.

69
00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:51.164
So I'm just going to type cat,
select a lookup products Category and

70
00:04:51.164 --> 00:04:55.500
I need that to be equal to
open new double quotes, Bikes.

71
00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:02.269
I'm going to close my bracket now,
select Currency again and

72
00:05:02.269 --> 00:05:06.285
click OK, and
if I come into my order items and

73
00:05:06.285 --> 00:05:12.760
tick Bike Sales I can now see my
Bike Sales next to my Item Total.

74
00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:16.300
If I remove Item Total and come up and

75
00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:21.138
choose some category for
my look up product, and

76
00:05:21.138 --> 00:05:26.934
grab product sub category and
pop it into columns,

77
00:05:26.934 --> 00:05:32.420
You'll notice it's only giving me the sub
categories for the category bikes.

78
00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:37.318
So you can actually see that that
calculate is forcing the filter context

79
00:05:37.318 --> 00:05:38.690
within this pivot.

80
00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:42.980
All right,
let's take this one step further.

81
00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:47.126
What I'd like to be able to see now
I'm going to get rid of subcategory

82
00:05:47.126 --> 00:05:50.013
I'd like to be able to
compare my bike sales for

83
00:05:50.013 --> 00:05:53.860
a given year to the bike
sales the previous year.

84
00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.650
So I'm going to need to add a slicer.

85
00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:01.391
So clicking into my pivot table,
I'm going to come up to pivot table,

86
00:06:01.391 --> 00:06:05.460
analyze Insert slicer, and
I need a slicer for year.

87
00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:08.050
I am going to use the one for
my date hierarchy.

88
00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:11.506
So select that and click OK.

89
00:06:11.506 --> 00:06:15.587
And now I'm going to move my slicer
down beneath my pivot table and

90
00:06:15.587 --> 00:06:19.129
I'm just going to make it quite wide and
quite short, and

91
00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:21.990
then change the columns to full.

92
00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:24.870
So I can actually see my
dates a little more easily.

93
00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:30.099
And if I select 2019,
I'm seeing my total bike sales for 2019.

94
00:06:30.099 --> 00:06:32.158
But now I need another measure,

95
00:06:32.158 --> 00:06:36.630
which will show me the bike
sales from the previous year.

96
00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:40.460
And this is where we're going to use
our time intelligence functions, and

97
00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:43.115
the one we're going to use
is same period last year.

98
00:06:45.378 --> 00:06:50.870
So clicking into your pivot, we're
going to come and add one last measure.

99
00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:55.620
Right click order items, add measure.

100
00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:01.944
This is going to be Bike Sales,
previous year and I'm splitting yr,

101
00:07:01.944 --> 00:07:07.150
and then I'm going to
/click into my formula box.

102
00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:11.588
Now once again, we're going to have
to use the calculate function,

103
00:07:11.588 --> 00:07:14.840
because I need to override this filter.

104
00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:18.466
So we're going to type cal and calculate.

105
00:07:18.466 --> 00:07:22.871
What we're trying to add up this
time is our bike sales, so bik,

106
00:07:22.871 --> 00:07:25.740
and tab to select Bike Sales.

107
00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:30.796
Then we're going to press a comma and
now we add our filter.

108
00:07:30.796 --> 00:07:35.379
We're going to filter to show just
the values for the same period last year.

109
00:07:35.379 --> 00:07:39.604
So SAM, and
tab to select same period last year and

110
00:07:39.604 --> 00:07:44.029
the argument that this
function needs is a date, but

111
00:07:44.029 --> 00:07:49.530
it's quite important that
the dates are sequential.

112
00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:51.645
So we're going to use
our calendar date and

113
00:07:51.645 --> 00:07:54.890
this is where our calendars
come in really handy.

114
00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:58.807
Now close your bracket for your same
period last year, close your bracket for

115
00:07:58.807 --> 00:07:59.720
your calculate.

116
00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:03.170
Set it to currency and click OK.

117
00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:08.632
A new measure has been added and
when I select it,

118
00:08:08.632 --> 00:08:15.030
I can now see my bike sales for this
year and the previous year side by side.

119
00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:21.080
If I select 2020, I can now see 2020 and
2019, side by side.

120
00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:26.880
And now we're starting to see the real
power of Power Pivot and Dax.

121
00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:31.837
So this week, we have seen how we can
add millions of rows to our data model,

122
00:08:31.837 --> 00:08:37.191
how we can create data analysis that draws
data from multiple related datasets,

123
00:08:37.191 --> 00:08:41.940
how we can access the data model using
pivot tables and cube functions.

124
00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:44.662
And most importantly,

125
00:08:44.662 --> 00:08:49.420
how we can use DAX to start building
powerful data analysis expressions.

126
00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:54.938
What you may not realize is that all
of the features we've been learning

127
00:08:54.938 --> 00:08:58.345
about this course so far,
are also available in another

128
00:08:58.345 --> 00:09:02.580
powerful business intelligence
tool called Power BI.

129
00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:04.977
And that's what we're
going to look at next week.
