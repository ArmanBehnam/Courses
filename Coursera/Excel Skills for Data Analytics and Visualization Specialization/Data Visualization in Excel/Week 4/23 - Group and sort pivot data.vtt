[MUSIC]

2
00:00:05.633 --> 00:00:09.301
In this video, we're going to
look at a range of techniques for

3
00:00:09.301 --> 00:00:12.950
transforming our data using grouping and
sorting.

4
00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.525
Ron needs to create one more pivot
table showing the total investment in

5
00:00:17.525 --> 00:00:20.080
renewable energy by year.

6
00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.980
You'll notice, however we do not have
just a year, we actually have a date.

7
00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.339
So the first thing we're going to look at
is working with dates in pivot tables.

8
00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:35.387
Now, making sure we click some way in the
data were going to come to our Insert tab.

9
00:00:35.387 --> 00:00:40.498
We're going to click PivotTable, and we're
going to put it in an existing location,

10
00:00:40.498 --> 00:00:43.860
and that's going to be
our investment sheet.

11
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.892
And A 3 and OK.

12
00:00:46.892 --> 00:00:52.619
Now we want to see our total amount,
some I'm just going to select Amount and

13
00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:56.914
we want to see it by date, and
I'm going to select Date and

14
00:00:56.914 --> 00:01:00.518
now something quite
interesting as happened.

15
00:01:00.518 --> 00:01:05.330
What it has actually done is taken
those dates an group them and

16
00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:11.729
I'll just expand this so you can see by
month, within quarter, within the year.

17
00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.089
This didn't used to happen in
older versions of Excel and

18
00:01:15.089 --> 00:01:17.751
it might not be something
you actually want.

19
00:01:17.751 --> 00:01:23.130
So the first thing I'm going to do is show
you how we can switch the grouping off,

20
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.730
and then we'll look at how we can
apply a grouping of our own choice.

21
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:34.098
So clicking somewhere into the dates
were going to come up to our pivot table

22
00:01:34.098 --> 00:01:40.096
analyze ribbon, and we're going to choose
ungroup and this will remove the grouping.

23
00:01:40.096 --> 00:01:43.855
And now it's quite hard to
actually analyze the data, so

24
00:01:43.855 --> 00:01:48.805
you'll probably find you need to add
some level of grouping to your dates.

25
00:01:48.805 --> 00:01:53.973
And the grouping we would like is
actually a year, so we're going to select

26
00:01:53.973 --> 00:01:58.745
one of the dates again, for dates and
numbers we choose group field.

27
00:01:58.745 --> 00:02:03.793
These are all the units you could
group by, and you can use multiple.

28
00:02:03.793 --> 00:02:09.690
So I could click on Years and
that will group by months and years.

29
00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.860
If I click on Months to unselect
that would just give me years.

30
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:22.091
Let's have a look at how it looks with
the two, so I'm going to do months and

31
00:02:22.091 --> 00:02:26.480
years and I'm going to say OK and
there's our group data.

32
00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.355
Just to the left of the group field,
you see two little buttons,

33
00:02:32.355 --> 00:02:35.830
a collapse field and expand field.

34
00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.699
If I click the collapse you'll see
it collapses all the groups, and

35
00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:44.400
if I expand it expands all the groups.

36
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.878
That's a quick way to expand and collapse,
but you can also do it manually.

37
00:02:49.878 --> 00:02:52.761
So if I come to one of the little minus or

38
00:02:52.761 --> 00:02:58.636
plus signs that will also allow me to
expand and collapse a particular group.

39
00:02:58.636 --> 00:03:03.823
I don't actually want to have
the month though, so I could come back

40
00:03:03.823 --> 00:03:08.828
to my group field or even easier,
I can come to my rose quadrants,

41
00:03:08.828 --> 00:03:15.250
grab the date field, drop it off, and
now I've just got the year grouping.

42
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.139
And you can do something very
similar with numeric values.

43
00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:22.758
So we had invoices that you
wanted to batch in hundreds,

44
00:03:22.758 --> 00:03:26.520
you could use the group field for
that as well.

45
00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.996
What we can look at next is how we
can create a custom grouping and

46
00:03:30.996 --> 00:03:35.317
for this I'd like you to come
to your Capacity By Year pivot.

47
00:03:35.317 --> 00:03:38.983
And we're going to collapse
our non renewable, so

48
00:03:38.983 --> 00:03:43.768
we can just see the total non
renewable rather than the breakdown.

49
00:03:43.768 --> 00:03:49.302
And what we're going to do now is add
a grouping to our renewable sources.

50
00:03:49.302 --> 00:03:52.871
Some of these sources like
marine energy for example,

51
00:03:52.871 --> 00:03:56.060
make up a very small
percentage of the capacity.

52
00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:01.815
So what we'd like to do is actually
take our bioenergy, geothermal,

53
00:04:01.815 --> 00:04:07.093
and marine and just group them
into a new category called other.

54
00:04:07.093 --> 00:04:10.375
And we're going to do this
by selecting them first.

55
00:04:10.375 --> 00:04:14.426
I'm going to click Bioenergy
call my control key down,

56
00:04:14.426 --> 00:04:16.677
click Geothermal and Marine.

57
00:04:16.677 --> 00:04:21.506
And then coming up to my group section,
I'm going to choose group selection.

58
00:04:23.324 --> 00:04:28.447
What that has effectively done is
create another layer in the hierarchy,

59
00:04:28.447 --> 00:04:32.164
so I still have my individual
main technologies, but

60
00:04:32.164 --> 00:04:35.816
I now have another layer
called Main Technology2.

61
00:04:35.816 --> 00:04:38.621
Where these three are grouped together.

62
00:04:38.621 --> 00:04:44.114
Now I need to give this grouping a proper
name, some I'm going to call it Other.

63
00:04:44.114 --> 00:04:49.129
And then I'm going to remove
Main Technology from my pivot field list,

64
00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:52.557
and now I'm just looking
at Main Technology2,

65
00:04:52.557 --> 00:04:57.870
which I could give a different name but
I'm quite happy with it.

66
00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.141
So that was how we could create a custom
Grouping, which can be really useful.

67
00:05:02.141 --> 00:05:05.312
Let's now look at sorting data in a pivot.

68
00:05:05.312 --> 00:05:09.782
And for this one, we're going to
come to capacity by region, and

69
00:05:09.782 --> 00:05:15.311
you'll notice when you create a pivot,
it automatically sorts by Roll label and

70
00:05:15.311 --> 00:05:18.827
column label, but
this might not be what you want.

71
00:05:18.827 --> 00:05:23.507
So for example,
let's say we wanted the largest capacity,

72
00:05:23.507 --> 00:05:26.370
we wanted to sort by total capacity.

73
00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:32.427
If I click into my grand total column and
come up to my data tab on my ribbon,

74
00:05:32.427 --> 00:05:39.464
I can use all the standard sort tools, and
I'd like to sort this largest to smallest,

75
00:05:39.464 --> 00:05:43.606
and you'll see it's
restarted the whole pivot.

76
00:05:43.606 --> 00:05:47.297
If I wanted to get back
to my alphabetic sort,

77
00:05:47.297 --> 00:05:51.777
I can just come back into my
role labels and click A to Z.

78
00:05:51.777 --> 00:05:56.706
You also have the option to sort by row,
so if I click into the raw

79
00:05:56.706 --> 00:06:01.263
data that I want to sort by and
click, my A-Z sort button,

80
00:06:01.263 --> 00:06:06.192
you see I have the option to sort
left to right, which is handy,

81
00:06:06.192 --> 00:06:11.326
but even more interesting is you
can create your own custom sort.

82
00:06:11.326 --> 00:06:15.630
You can just specify where you
want each value to go, and

83
00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:18.294
there are a few ways of doing this.

84
00:06:18.294 --> 00:06:23.633
One that's very interesting is
if I decided I wanted Asia to be

85
00:06:23.633 --> 00:06:28.973
down here instead,
I can actually just start by typing Asia,

86
00:06:28.973 --> 00:06:34.747
press Enter and you'll see it's
actually popped Asia down here.

87
00:06:34.747 --> 00:06:39.028
Probably more intuitive
is you can drag and drop.

88
00:06:39.028 --> 00:06:44.054
And let's say I want North America
to be at the top of the list,

89
00:06:44.054 --> 00:06:46.483
I'm going to select the row.

90
00:06:46.483 --> 00:06:51.438
So, I've just come just to
the right of the 10, then,

91
00:06:51.438 --> 00:06:57.445
click onto the green border that
surrounds it till I get my move icon.

92
00:06:57.445 --> 00:07:00.622
And then, I can just click and drag.

93
00:07:00.622 --> 00:07:04.141
So, you can reorganize your role labels or

94
00:07:04.141 --> 00:07:08.263
your column labels to be
in any sequence you like.

95
00:07:08.263 --> 00:07:11.932
If I remove region from the Rose quadrant,
and

96
00:07:11.932 --> 00:07:15.798
then, re added,
It remembers my sought order.

97
00:07:15.798 --> 00:07:19.413
Finally, there's one
very interesting option.

98
00:07:19.413 --> 00:07:23.894
Which is not obvious, and
this is called sorting with a custom list,

99
00:07:23.894 --> 00:07:28.857
and I'm going to use a completely
different workbook to demonstrate this.

100
00:07:28.857 --> 00:07:31.480
So, this is just a demo workbook.

101
00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:35.000
You see, I've got some very simple data.

102
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.992
I've got a weeks worth of sales
from Sally, May and Anne, and

103
00:07:39.992 --> 00:07:44.999
I've already created a pivot
table showing the total sales.

104
00:07:44.999 --> 00:07:47.820
If I add day of the week to that pivot,

105
00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:53.467
you see it's sorts Monday to Sunday,
which at first glance makes sense.

106
00:07:53.467 --> 00:07:55.250
But that's not alphabetical.

107
00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:58.666
So, how did Excel know to
sort in that sequence?

108
00:07:58.666 --> 00:08:02.396
Well, the answer is it's
used a custom list.

109
00:08:02.396 --> 00:08:08.538
If you haven't heard the term custom list
before, when I type Monday into a cell and

110
00:08:08.538 --> 00:08:12.945
drag down, it automatically
gives me the days of the week.

111
00:08:12.945 --> 00:08:18.937
And the same works for months of the year,
and that is called a custom list.

112
00:08:18.937 --> 00:08:24.157
To locate the custom lists,
you need to come to file, come to options,

113
00:08:24.157 --> 00:08:28.681
select Advanced, and
if you scroll right down to the bottom,

114
00:08:28.681 --> 00:08:31.645
you'll see a button Edit custom lists.

115
00:08:31.645 --> 00:08:36.022
These are the custom lists
that come standard with Excel.

116
00:08:36.022 --> 00:08:40.854
But there's nothing to stop you
creating your own, and if you do,

117
00:08:40.854 --> 00:08:45.448
pivot tables will automatically
sort using that custom list.

118
00:08:45.448 --> 00:08:50.205
Which is really handy, but
it does come with one small caution.

119
00:08:50.205 --> 00:08:55.236
I'm going to cancel out of here,
and click into the Pivot table.

120
00:08:55.236 --> 00:09:01.835
I'm going to remove the day, and instead,
I'm going to sort by salesperson.

121
00:09:01.835 --> 00:09:05.546
And something very odd has happened.

122
00:09:05.546 --> 00:09:11.250
That is definitely not alphabetical,
and if I click somewhere in there,

123
00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:15.305
and click the A to Z,
it's still not alphabetical.

124
00:09:15.305 --> 00:09:16.940
Now, why is that?

125
00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:21.634
Well, the reason is this may isn't just

126
00:09:21.634 --> 00:09:26.199
a girls name, it's also a month name.

127
00:09:26.199 --> 00:09:29.925
See, for people called Jan or
April or May,

128
00:09:29.925 --> 00:09:34.760
they are automatically going
to sort at the top of the list

129
00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:40.126
because Excel will favor the custom
lists over any other data.

130
00:09:40.126 --> 00:09:45.941
So, in rare situations,
you may find you need to turn them off.

131
00:09:45.941 --> 00:09:48.304
Let's see how to do that.

132
00:09:48.304 --> 00:09:53.782
So, in your pivot table,
you can come to options in the ribbon or

133
00:09:53.782 --> 00:09:58.954
you can just right click, and
choose Pivot table options and

134
00:09:58.954 --> 00:10:03.781
on the total Filters tab,
you'll see there's an option.

135
00:10:03.781 --> 00:10:06.120
Use custom lists when sorting.

136
00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:10.860
Now what we're going to
do is turn that off.

137
00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:15.280
So there's our sought
without the custom list.

138
00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:19.220
So quite a lot of options
we've looked at in this video.

139
00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:22.025
Remember on your PivotTable analyze,

140
00:10:22.025 --> 00:10:27.384
your group selection will allow you to
group fields for dates and numbers.

141
00:10:27.384 --> 00:10:31.470
Or group selection for
your specific groups.

142
00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:36.198
And on your data tab,
you can use a variety of sort options.

143
00:10:36.198 --> 00:10:38.559
Or you can use a custom list.

144
00:10:38.559 --> 00:10:44.340
In the next video, we are going to
look at filtering data in our pivots.
