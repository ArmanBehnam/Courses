00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.290
In this video, we're going to

2
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.150
look at how we can customize

3
00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.800
the layout and the calculations
within our pivot table.

4
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.510
In the previous video,

5
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.960
we created several pivot
tables and in each case,

6
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.270
when we added a numeric value to

7
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.970
our values quadrant,
it's summed it up.

8
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.870
What this pivot table is showing
us is the total capacity

9
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:32.235
for each region from 2000-2019.

10
00:00:32.235 --> 00:00:34.530
What we all would like to see is

11
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.430
the average capacity across
the same time frame.

12
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.150
We're going to have to
change our calculation.

13
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.130
There are quite a few
ways of doing this.

14
00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.090
If you come to the field in

15
00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.655
the values quadrant and click,

16
00:00:49.655 --> 00:00:52.535
you can choose Value
Field Settings.

17
00:00:52.535 --> 00:00:54.110
But if you come into one of

18
00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.720
the calculations themselves
and right-click,

19
00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.395
you actually get a
lot more options.

20
00:00:59.395 --> 00:01:01.940
That's what we're
going to do and if

21
00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.595
you scroll down to
summarize values by,

22
00:01:04.595 --> 00:01:06.890
you'll see the
calculations used most

23
00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.360
frequently and
there's our average.

24
00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.350
If you wanted a calculation

25
00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:13.955
that you didn't see in the list,

26
00:01:13.955 --> 00:01:16.610
again, right-click but this time,

27
00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:17.720
we're going to come to

28
00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.530
value field settings and

29
00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.840
this gives us the complete
set of calculations.

30
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.530
You can see it's not a
very extensive list,

31
00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.010
but we're going to do
now is set this back to

32
00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.910
a sum calculation and then
we're going to say, okay.

33
00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.295
Sometimes however, we don't
want to see discrete values.

34
00:01:39.295 --> 00:01:42.540
We actually want to
compare the values.

35
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.780
For example, we all would like to

36
00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.780
see what percentage
of capacity is

37
00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.940
made up of non-renewable

38
00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.095
versus renewable for each region.

39
00:01:53.095 --> 00:01:54.880
To do this again,

40
00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.500
we're going to right-click,

41
00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.845
but we're going to
come to Show Values As

42
00:01:59.845 --> 00:02:01.660
and there are a lot of

43
00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.805
calculations for
generating percentages.

44
00:02:04.805 --> 00:02:08.890
For example, percentage
of grand total will

45
00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.155
recalculate each of those values

46
00:02:11.155 --> 00:02:14.035
as percentage of grand total.

47
00:02:14.035 --> 00:02:16.390
But what we would like to see is

48
00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.030
a percentage of the row total,

49
00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.755
so I'm going to select that.

50
00:02:21.755 --> 00:02:24.295
Now we can straight away see that

51
00:02:24.295 --> 00:02:26.950
South America and
Central America,

52
00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.460
more than 60 percent of
their capacity is renewable.

53
00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.500
Now, there are loads of options.

54
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.410
Unfortunately, we
can't look at all of

55
00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.260
them but let's look at one of
the more interesting ones.

56
00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.710
I'm going to right-click,

57
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:48.110
come to Show Values As and
right near the bottom,

58
00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.550
you actually have the
option to rank your fields.

59
00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.235
What we all would like to
do is rank the regions

60
00:02:55.235 --> 00:02:59.140
based on capacity from
largest to smallest.

61
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.130
I'm going to click on that

62
00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.455
and is checking that
we want region.

63
00:03:03.455 --> 00:03:05.509
I'm going to say okay,

64
00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:07.385
and Asia has a one.

65
00:03:07.385 --> 00:03:10.880
That means it has the
largest renewable capacity,

66
00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.540
whereas the Middle
East has the smallest.

67
00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.875
Now to remove the calculation,

68
00:03:15.875 --> 00:03:18.670
we just right-click, come to

69
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.525
Show Values As and
choose no calculation.

70
00:03:22.525 --> 00:03:26.855
Quite a few options there for
changing our calculations.

71
00:03:26.855 --> 00:03:29.255
Let's now make our pivot tables

72
00:03:29.255 --> 00:03:31.795
look a little bit
more attractive.

73
00:03:31.795 --> 00:03:36.335
For this, I'm going to come
to my capacity by year sheet.

74
00:03:36.335 --> 00:03:38.780
The first thing
we'd like to do is

75
00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.105
change our number formatting.

76
00:03:41.105 --> 00:03:44.255
I don't want so many
decimal places.

77
00:03:44.255 --> 00:03:48.020
I would like a separator
for every three zeros,

78
00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.170
a thousand separator and again,

79
00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.195
loads of different options here.

80
00:03:53.195 --> 00:03:57.720
But I'd like to show you the
value field settings, again.

81
00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.235
In value field settings,

82
00:04:03.235 --> 00:04:04.730
you have not only the option to

83
00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.055
choose which function
to summarize by,

84
00:04:07.055 --> 00:04:08.495
you can also select,

85
00:04:08.495 --> 00:04:10.700
Show Values As to change

86
00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.580
your calculation and you can
change your number format.

87
00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.804
If you're making
a lot of changes,

88
00:04:16.804 --> 00:04:19.590
this dialogue is a good option.

89
00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:23.360
When I click number format,

90
00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.310
I can choose any of the
standard ones or create my own.

91
00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.205
I'm just going to come to number,

92
00:04:31.205 --> 00:04:34.190
set it to zero decimal places,

93
00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:35.630
and I do want

94
00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:40.195
a 1000 separator and then
I'm going to say, okay.

95
00:04:40.195 --> 00:04:42.710
The other thing I can do

96
00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.645
is I can actually
change my table name.

97
00:04:46.645 --> 00:04:49.655
Instead of some of electricity,

98
00:04:49.655 --> 00:04:51.680
I'm going to remove that and make

99
00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.655
that total and say okay,

100
00:04:54.655 --> 00:04:57.320
so that looks at a
little bit better.

101
00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.705
But for a really
great selection of

102
00:04:59.705 --> 00:05:02.780
options for changing the
formatting of your table,

103
00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.735
we're going to come
to our Design tab.

104
00:05:05.735 --> 00:05:07.670
Make sure you are in

105
00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:10.700
your pivot table and
click Design and

106
00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:12.710
here we have options for changing

107
00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.220
both our style and our layouts.

108
00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.274
We'll start with the styles.

109
00:05:18.274 --> 00:05:20.360
I'm going to click the Dropdown,

110
00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.360
the more button, and these just

111
00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.290
change your border colors
and your cell color.

112
00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:28.790
But some of them really
make your tables look

113
00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:31.775
nice so choose the one
you like, the look of.

114
00:05:31.775 --> 00:05:33.590
You can then slightly tweak

115
00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:37.354
those style options or you
can change the layout.

116
00:05:37.354 --> 00:05:40.640
So let's start with
our grand totals.

117
00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.175
Grand totals automatically show

118
00:05:43.175 --> 00:05:45.230
for each column in each row.

119
00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:48.455
But you can choose to
switch them on for both,

120
00:05:48.455 --> 00:05:52.265
or you can switch them
on for one or the other.

121
00:05:52.265 --> 00:05:55.355
I'm going to leave
mine on for both.

122
00:05:55.355 --> 00:05:57.350
Now, subtotals.

123
00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:00.470
The moment you have more
than one field in your rows,

124
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:02.015
or your columns quadrant,

125
00:06:02.015 --> 00:06:06.455
you will automatically get
subtotals and by default,

126
00:06:06.455 --> 00:06:08.675
they show at the
top of the group.

127
00:06:08.675 --> 00:06:11.435
But you can choose
to turn these off,

128
00:06:11.435 --> 00:06:12.920
or you can choose to show

129
00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.960
them at the bottom of the group.

130
00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.525
It may seem a bit more logical,

131
00:06:17.525 --> 00:06:19.925
but it does take more space.

132
00:06:19.925 --> 00:06:22.730
We can also change
our report layout.

133
00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:24.995
So clicking the drop
down by default,

134
00:06:24.995 --> 00:06:27.185
it shows in compact form.

135
00:06:27.185 --> 00:06:28.760
But we could choose

136
00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:32.870
outline form or the more
conventional tabular form.

137
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:34.685
If you choose tabular,

138
00:06:34.685 --> 00:06:38.885
you can also choose to
repeat all the item labels.

139
00:06:38.885 --> 00:06:43.370
So this now looks more like
a conventional table and I

140
00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:47.685
could copy paste values and
repeat that if I wanted to.

141
00:06:47.685 --> 00:06:52.855
I don't, and I must admit I
prefer the compact forms.

142
00:06:52.855 --> 00:06:55.975
I'm going to switch back to that.

143
00:06:55.975 --> 00:06:58.870
Lastly, you have
the option to add

144
00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:01.245
a blank row after each group.

145
00:07:01.245 --> 00:07:06.455
This just adds readability TR
table to make it look nice.

146
00:07:06.455 --> 00:07:08.930
Now having to go through
this process for

147
00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:12.095
every pivot table can be a
little bit time-consuming.

148
00:07:12.095 --> 00:07:15.875
If you have 2019 Excel or later,

149
00:07:15.875 --> 00:07:18.710
you actually have the
new option to change

150
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:21.500
your default styles
of your tables.

151
00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:23.930
I'll quickly show
you how to do this.

152
00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:26.210
We're going to come to file,

153
00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:28.325
then options and data.

154
00:07:28.325 --> 00:07:30.470
Right at the top,

155
00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:35.105
is make changes to the default
layout of pivot tables.

156
00:07:35.105 --> 00:07:38.795
We're going to click the
"Edit default layout".

157
00:07:38.795 --> 00:07:40.850
You can either import it from

158
00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:42.605
an existing Pivot Table

159
00:07:42.605 --> 00:07:45.575
or just go and set
it up manually.

160
00:07:45.575 --> 00:07:48.664
If you decide you want to
go back to the default,

161
00:07:48.664 --> 00:07:50.765
you can always do that.

162
00:07:50.765 --> 00:07:53.225
So if you have one of
the later versions,

163
00:07:53.225 --> 00:07:56.645
I encourage you to come
in there and have a play.

164
00:07:56.645 --> 00:08:00.800
I'm going to cancel
for now and okay.

165
00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:04.385
You also have a few slightly
more hidden layout options

166
00:08:04.385 --> 00:08:06.305
behind the right-click.

167
00:08:06.305 --> 00:08:08.270
To demonstrate this, I'm going

168
00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:09.860
to get the region field from

169
00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:11.930
my field list and drop it

170
00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:14.780
into the top of my rows quadrant.

171
00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:18.440
So I now have a breakdown
by region as well,

172
00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:22.625
and now you can see I'm
getting two sets of subtotals,

173
00:08:22.625 --> 00:08:24.500
but I don't want both.

174
00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:26.420
I actually want to
switch it off for

175
00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:28.730
the region and we can do this.

176
00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:32.420
I'm going to come to one of
the regions and right-click.

177
00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:36.665
There's an option to show
or not show the subtotal.

178
00:08:36.665 --> 00:08:38.450
When I select that,

179
00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:40.580
you can see it now switched

180
00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:43.265
off the subtotals for my regions.

181
00:08:43.265 --> 00:08:45.830
What's even more
interesting is you can

182
00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:48.740
change the calculation
for your subtotal.

183
00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:51.260
So to do this, I'm going to come

184
00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.080
to non-renewable and I'm going

185
00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:56.570
to right-click and I'm going

186
00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:59.585
to come down to field settings.

187
00:08:59.585 --> 00:09:02.300
Now at this point, I
could switch it off

188
00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:05.435
or I can come to customize.

189
00:09:05.435 --> 00:09:07.970
I could choose to
have an average,

190
00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:11.900
or I can have an
average and a sum.

191
00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:14.765
So one-click turns it on,

192
00:09:14.765 --> 00:09:16.190
another click turns it

193
00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:19.970
off and then I'm
going to say, "Okay".

194
00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:22.865
I'm now getting two subtotals.

195
00:09:22.865 --> 00:09:24.890
It has moved them to the bottom,

196
00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:26.720
but isn't that amazing?

197
00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:31.250
Finally, if we come to our
pivot table, Analyze ribbon,

198
00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:32.960
on the far left is

199
00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:36.425
an options button and
in the newer version,

200
00:09:36.425 --> 00:09:38.360
there's a really
interesting option in

201
00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:41.570
the layout and format
which allows us to

202
00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:43.610
specify what we want to

203
00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:47.150
see when there's no
data for that field.

204
00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:50.825
So Pivot Tables by default
show it as a blank cell.

205
00:09:50.825 --> 00:09:54.065
What we could choose
to show it as a zero.

206
00:09:54.065 --> 00:09:58.580
I'm going to say "Okay" and
the change has been met.

207
00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:00.635
We don't really want to keep

208
00:10:00.635 --> 00:10:03.335
our region in our rows quadrant.

209
00:10:03.335 --> 00:10:05.510
So I'm going to grab region,

210
00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:09.110
grab and drop that
out to get rid of it,

211
00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:13.100
and there's our beautifully
formatted Pivot Table.

212
00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:15.035
So the main takeaways from

213
00:10:15.035 --> 00:10:17.845
this video to change
your calculations,

214
00:10:17.845 --> 00:10:18.970
right-click on one of

215
00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:21.310
the calculated values
and you've got

216
00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:25.630
your show values by or
your show values as.

217
00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:29.245
To change both your layout
and you're styling,

218
00:10:29.245 --> 00:10:31.480
you've got your design ribbon to

219
00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:34.670
make your pivot look great.
