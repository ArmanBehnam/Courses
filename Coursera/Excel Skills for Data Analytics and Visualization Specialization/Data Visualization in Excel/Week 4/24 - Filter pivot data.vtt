00:00:04.959 --> 00:00:09.654
In this video, we're going to look at
techniques for filtering data in our

2
00:00:09.654 --> 00:00:13.396
pivots so we can focus on just
the information that we need.

3
00:00:13.396 --> 00:00:15.655
We're in the investment tab and

4
00:00:15.655 --> 00:00:20.767
Rowan would like to see the total
investment in 2001 for Argentina.

5
00:00:20.767 --> 00:00:23.623
So let's make a couple of
changes to our pivot table.

6
00:00:23.623 --> 00:00:27.445
I'm going to put years into
the column section and

7
00:00:27.445 --> 00:00:30.729
then I'm going to add recipient country.

8
00:00:30.729 --> 00:00:35.539
We're getting a really large data set
here, so we need a way of zooming in and

9
00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:37.957
just seeing the information we need.

10
00:00:37.957 --> 00:00:39.657
Both the row labels,

11
00:00:39.657 --> 00:00:45.338
an column label header fields allow
us to both sort and filter the data.

12
00:00:45.338 --> 00:00:49.115
So for example,
if I come to the column labels and

13
00:00:49.115 --> 00:00:54.198
click the drop down,
each individual year is represented here.

14
00:00:54.198 --> 00:01:00.583
And I can just untick all and
choose 2001 and say OK.

15
00:01:00.583 --> 00:01:04.578
And then I could do something
very similar for the row labels.

16
00:01:04.578 --> 00:01:09.381
So I'm going to click the drop down,
and I'm going to untick all.

17
00:01:09.381 --> 00:01:13.521
And I'm going to choose Argentina,
and there's my answer.

18
00:01:13.521 --> 00:01:17.782
But Rowan now wants to have
a look at Argentina and Brazil.

19
00:01:17.782 --> 00:01:21.018
So we're going to come
back to the row labels.

20
00:01:21.018 --> 00:01:25.612
We could just start scrolling through,
but we have a lot of data.

21
00:01:25.612 --> 00:01:28.232
It might be quicker to search, so

22
00:01:28.232 --> 00:01:32.825
clicking in the search box
I'm going to type B-R-A-Z.

23
00:01:32.825 --> 00:01:36.307
And there's only one country
that meets that description.

24
00:01:36.307 --> 00:01:41.851
But if I just click OK,
it's going to replace my Argentina filter.

25
00:01:41.851 --> 00:01:46.499
And I want to add this to
the current selection, so

26
00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:52.601
I'm going to tick that option and
say OK, and now I've got both.

27
00:01:52.601 --> 00:01:55.687
To clear our filter,
we have a few options.

28
00:01:55.687 --> 00:01:58.842
You can come back to
the original row label and

29
00:01:58.842 --> 00:02:01.426
just clear that particular filter.

30
00:02:01.426 --> 00:02:03.573
But when you have a lot of filters,

31
00:02:03.573 --> 00:02:06.618
manually clearing each
one could be quite slow.

32
00:02:06.618 --> 00:02:10.219
So a nice option and
some quicker options if you like.

33
00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:13.442
If you come to your PivotTable Analyze and

34
00:02:13.442 --> 00:02:17.875
select the clear,
there's an option to clear filters.

35
00:02:17.875 --> 00:02:22.385
The problem with this is
it's always two clicks.

36
00:02:22.385 --> 00:02:26.702
I prefer the data tab which gives
you the same clear filter and

37
00:02:26.702 --> 00:02:30.183
that will clear all
the filters from that pivot.

38
00:02:30.183 --> 00:02:33.811
So I'm going to click on that and
we're back.

39
00:02:33.811 --> 00:02:37.663
Let's look at a couple of small,
slightly sophisticated filters.

40
00:02:37.663 --> 00:02:41.989
So in the next example,
Rowan wants to see investment in all

41
00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:46.069
countries beginning with a b for
2015 and onwards.

42
00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:50.907
Coming to our row labels first,
we could start unchecking everything

43
00:02:50.907 --> 00:02:55.419
that doesn't begin with a b, but
again, not really efficient.

44
00:02:55.419 --> 00:03:00.074
If you come to your label filters,
however, you get all sorts of options for

45
00:03:00.074 --> 00:03:01.176
filtering text.

46
00:03:01.176 --> 00:03:06.481
And we want begins with, so
I'm going to choose that, type a b.

47
00:03:06.481 --> 00:03:10.103
It's not case sensitive and say OK.

48
00:03:10.103 --> 00:03:13.612
And we get a similar selection for
working with dates.

49
00:03:13.612 --> 00:03:16.411
I'm going to come to column labels and

50
00:03:16.411 --> 00:03:21.400
I'm going to come to date filters and
wow, what a great selection.

51
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:27.631
We actually want all dates after a certain
date, so I'm going to choose the after.

52
00:03:27.631 --> 00:03:34.598
An I'd be tempted to just type 2014, but
remember these aren't actually years.

53
00:03:34.598 --> 00:03:39.235
They're actually real dates, so
I have to put in a full date.

54
00:03:39.235 --> 00:03:45.664
So I'm going to just put
31st of the 12th 2014.

55
00:03:45.664 --> 00:03:47.606
Now, one little caution.

56
00:03:47.606 --> 00:03:52.787
If my dates contain times
midday on the 31st of the 12,

57
00:03:52.787 --> 00:03:58.179
2014 is considered to be
after the 31st of the 12th,

58
00:03:58.179 --> 00:04:02.216
so that wouldn't actually be filtered out.

59
00:04:02.216 --> 00:04:07.067
What you can do to avoid the problem
is select whole days and

60
00:04:07.067 --> 00:04:09.450
that will ignore the times.

61
00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.640
I can now say OK.

62
00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.081
And the filter has been applied.

63
00:04:14.081 --> 00:04:16.587
Let's clear those filters again.

64
00:04:16.587 --> 00:04:20.469
So on my data tab I'm
clicking clear filter.

65
00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:25.352
And we're now going to remove
the year from the columns, so

66
00:04:25.352 --> 00:04:28.583
I'm going to grab that and drop it off.

67
00:04:28.583 --> 00:04:32.029
Now the last question
Rowan wants to ask is,

68
00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:36.608
what were the top five
recipient countries for 2010?

69
00:04:36.608 --> 00:04:40.505
Now, this time I don't actually
want to filter my row label.

70
00:04:40.505 --> 00:04:43.578
I want to filter by amount.

71
00:04:43.578 --> 00:04:48.377
So I'm going to come to my
row labels field header.

72
00:04:48.377 --> 00:04:53.374
But instead of label filters,
I'm going to choose value filters.

73
00:04:53.374 --> 00:04:58.937
And you'll see right at the bottom we
even have the option to do a Top 10.

74
00:04:58.937 --> 00:05:00.591
It doesn't have to be a 10.

75
00:05:00.591 --> 00:05:04.809
It doesn't even have to be items,
that could be percents.

76
00:05:04.809 --> 00:05:09.775
Now we want the top five and
I'm going to click OK.

77
00:05:09.775 --> 00:05:13.111
And they are my top five
recipient countries, but

78
00:05:13.111 --> 00:05:15.256
this is across all the years, so

79
00:05:15.256 --> 00:05:20.831
there's one more step we need to narrow
this down to show us just the 2010 data.

80
00:05:20.831 --> 00:05:25.167
But we no longer have the year
information in our pivot.

81
00:05:25.167 --> 00:05:29.908
What you can do if you want to filter
by a field that you don't necessarily

82
00:05:29.908 --> 00:05:33.793
want to show in the pivot is you
can use the filters area, and

83
00:05:33.793 --> 00:05:36.540
that's exactly what we're going to do.

84
00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:43.390
So we're going to find years and
drag it and drop it into the filters area.

85
00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:47.443
So this has added a filter
above our pivot table, and

86
00:05:47.443 --> 00:05:49.844
you can add as many as you like.

87
00:05:49.844 --> 00:05:54.567
Now it's still showing me the data for
all the years, but

88
00:05:54.567 --> 00:05:59.095
if I click the drop down and
select 2010 and say OK,

89
00:05:59.095 --> 00:06:04.232
it is now just showing me
the top five recipients in 2010.

90
00:06:04.232 --> 00:06:07.640
So these filter fields
are immensely useful, but

91
00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:10.245
they have one other amazing feature.

92
00:06:10.245 --> 00:06:14.570
And to demonstrate this,
I'm going to ask you to come to

93
00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:18.811
the RE versus non-RE pivots and
just click inside it.

94
00:06:18.811 --> 00:06:22.820
Which we actually want to do here is,
Rowan's been asked to

95
00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:27.393
produce three separate reports,
one showing this information for

96
00:06:27.393 --> 00:06:31.416
the year 2000, one for
2010 and one for 2017.

97
00:06:31.416 --> 00:06:34.970
Now what he doesn't want to
have to do is filter the data,

98
00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:39.342
copy paste field, copy paste, and
keep repeating that process, and

99
00:06:39.342 --> 00:06:42.030
we often find ourselves in that position.

100
00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:46.606
So what we're going to do is actually
use the filter field to produce

101
00:06:46.606 --> 00:06:47.980
the reports for us.

102
00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:51.689
Let's start by adding
year to our filter field.

103
00:06:51.689 --> 00:06:54.941
And then we're going to
come up to our filter.

104
00:06:54.941 --> 00:06:56.792
Click the drop down.

105
00:06:56.792 --> 00:07:02.392
This time I want multiple items, so
I'm going to check select multiple items.

106
00:07:02.392 --> 00:07:07.250
Untick all and we're going to choose 2000,

107
00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:11.407
2010, and 2017 and then say OK.

108
00:07:11.407 --> 00:07:16.078
What this is actually showing
us is the cumulative totals for

109
00:07:16.078 --> 00:07:19.659
those three years,
which is not what we want.

110
00:07:19.659 --> 00:07:22.350
But that's step number one.

111
00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:27.609
Now step number two, we're going
to come to pivot table analyze.

112
00:07:27.609 --> 00:07:31.010
We're going to find
the options button on the left,

113
00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:34.039
we're going to click
the drop down next to it.

114
00:07:34.039 --> 00:07:37.945
And we're going to choose
show report filter pages.

115
00:07:37.945 --> 00:07:40.594
Is checking that's
the filter we want to use.

116
00:07:40.594 --> 00:07:42.302
Which is correct?

117
00:07:42.302 --> 00:07:45.169
So we're going to say OK.

118
00:07:45.169 --> 00:07:48.980
And we're now looking at the report for
2000.

119
00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:52.064
If we have a look at our worksheet tabs,

120
00:07:52.064 --> 00:07:56.743
you see we also have a report for
2010 and for 2017.

121
00:07:56.743 --> 00:08:01.593
So what we did there was used
to filter in our original report

122
00:08:01.593 --> 00:08:06.066
to generate multiple other
reports amazingly quick.

123
00:08:06.066 --> 00:08:10.715
So, to recap, we've looked at how
we can use both row labels and

124
00:08:10.715 --> 00:08:15.709
column labels to filter our data and
how we can use our filter fields to

125
00:08:15.709 --> 00:08:19.326
add filters for
values that are not in the pivot and

126
00:08:19.326 --> 00:08:23.928
to generate pivot reports using
the show report filter pages.

127
00:08:23.928 --> 00:08:27.841
There is one more amazing filter option,
called a slicer,

128
00:08:27.841 --> 00:08:32.782
which we're going to show you next week
when we start doing our dashboard.
