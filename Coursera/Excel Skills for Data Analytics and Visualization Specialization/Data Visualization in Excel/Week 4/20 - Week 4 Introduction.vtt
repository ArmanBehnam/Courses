00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:06.300
So far, we have looked at
such a fantastic range

2
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.450
of techniques for creating
different visualizations.

3
00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.220
But I couldn't help
notice that up to now,

4
00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.090
all the data was nicely
prepared for us.

5
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:16.505
Now in my experience,

6
00:00:16.505 --> 00:00:18.725
that is usually not the case.

7
00:00:18.725 --> 00:00:21.020
You are so right.
More often than not,

8
00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.300
we're presented with a
ton of raw data that we

9
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.030
have to somehow extract
the information we need.

10
00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:27.860
There are a lot of
ways of doing this,

11
00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.450
but one of the easiest ways,

12
00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:31.175
is to use a pivot table,

13
00:00:31.175 --> 00:00:33.340
and that's what we're going
to focus on this week.

14
00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.100
How would you define a pivot
table for our learners?

15
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.630
A pivot table is basically

16
00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.775
an answer to a specific question,

17
00:00:40.775 --> 00:00:43.130
like, what were my
sales per quarter,

18
00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.670
or what percentage of
orders ship last week?

19
00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.595
A pivot table summarizes
and filters the data

20
00:00:49.595 --> 00:00:51.635
according to our specifications

21
00:00:51.635 --> 00:00:53.760
and does all the
calculations for us.

22
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.500
All we need to do is
frame the question.

23
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.065
Mickey. You make it
sound very easy.

24
00:00:59.065 --> 00:01:02.315
Well, it is once you
understand how it works.

25
00:01:02.315 --> 00:01:05.255
I agree that the mechanics
are quite simple

26
00:01:05.255 --> 00:01:08.195
and the videos will explain
these in some detail.

27
00:01:08.195 --> 00:01:12.220
But I think often the difficulty
comes even before that,

28
00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.015
we have this massive data,

29
00:01:14.015 --> 00:01:15.680
let's say sales data,

30
00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.979
and we want to know how well
the business is performing.

31
00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:22.295
How do we translate that
into a pivot table?

32
00:01:22.295 --> 00:01:24.465
That's a really good question.

33
00:01:24.465 --> 00:01:26.210
Often it will take
discussion with

34
00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.820
stakeholders and several
iterations to get it right.

35
00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.715
But it's easier if we
understand a few key concepts.

36
00:01:31.715 --> 00:01:33.410
Think about data is containing

37
00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.665
two key components,
attributes and metrics.

38
00:01:36.665 --> 00:01:39.785
Attributes are how we
categorize data, so,

39
00:01:39.785 --> 00:01:43.795
region, retailer, these
give us the context.

40
00:01:43.795 --> 00:01:45.975
Metrics are what we quantify.

41
00:01:45.975 --> 00:01:47.670
They are usually the
numbers in our data,

42
00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.100
so, things like cost and revenue.

43
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.935
Pivot tables then give us a
third component, a measure.

44
00:01:53.935 --> 00:01:55.820
These are the calculations we

45
00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.285
perform, like total revenue.

46
00:01:58.285 --> 00:02:00.755
Coming back to your example,

47
00:02:00.755 --> 00:02:03.080
we might start with a
broad question like,

48
00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.910
what would my total sales?

49
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:06.830
But the answer doesn't
really tell us very much,

50
00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.735
because it doesn't
have any context.

51
00:02:08.735 --> 00:02:10.910
Refining our question, we can use

52
00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.460
the pivot table to ask how much

53
00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.380
of my sales increased from

54
00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.960
the previous year
for each region,

55
00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.040
and this will produce

56
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.935
a useful measure of how our
business is performing.

57
00:02:21.935 --> 00:02:23.810
That makes sense, and I

58
00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.970
suppose because it's
all drag-and-drop,

59
00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.070
we can easily change
and manipulate

60
00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.090
the attributes and the metrics
to refine our questions.

61
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.219
What if we wanted to focus

62
00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:36.470
on a specific subset of the data?

63
00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:37.640
Well, that's another thing that

64
00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.185
pivot tables do really well.

65
00:02:39.185 --> 00:02:41.810
There are a lot of options
for filtering them so that

66
00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.510
we can seamlessly slice
and dice our data.

67
00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.790
We also have a
surprisingly wide range

68
00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:47.900
of tools for making

69
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.700
our pivot tables look good

70
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.885
and we can even apply
conditional formatting.

71
00:02:52.885 --> 00:02:56.690
Custom number formatting and
of course, most importantly,

72
00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.570
we can present our pivot
data using pivot charts,

73
00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.990
which we'll look at
in the last video.

74
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.125
Easy to create and change,

75
00:03:04.125 --> 00:03:08.370
great visualizations, no
conflicts formulas needed.

76
00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.265
Are there any downsides?

77
00:03:10.265 --> 00:03:13.190
Well, it is important to be
aware that pivot tables do

78
00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.475
not immediately update if
the underlying data changes.

79
00:03:16.475 --> 00:03:18.334
They do need to be refreshed.

80
00:03:18.334 --> 00:03:20.570
Good point. But as
long as you put

81
00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.790
the original data in a table,

82
00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.490
all you need to do is
click the Refresh button.

83
00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:28.925
Absolutely. Just make sure
your users are aware of this.

84
00:03:28.925 --> 00:03:31.595
I think for me, one
of the limitations of

85
00:03:31.595 --> 00:03:33.200
traditional pivot
charts is there only

86
00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.240
pulled data from a single source,

87
00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.590
and I do find

88
00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.230
that calculations we can
perform a little bit limited.

89
00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:40.880
The great news is that,

90
00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.825
all this has changed
with PowerPivot index.

91
00:03:43.825 --> 00:03:46.310
We won't actually be covering
those in this course,

92
00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:47.570
but what we're going to do is lay

93
00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:49.760
a really solid foundation
to allow us to

94
00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.285
to explore these power
options in the next course.

95
00:03:53.285 --> 00:03:54.900
One last question.

96
00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.175
We create all these
pivot tables and charts,

97
00:03:58.175 --> 00:04:01.490
and typically they're all
sitting in separate worksheets.

98
00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:03.470
How do we make this
information more

99
00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.980
accessible to our audience?

100
00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.170
It's often a really good idea
to pull it all together in

101
00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.450
a single report or dashboard and

102
00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.270
that's exactly what we'll
be looking at next week.

103
00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.445
So much to look forward to.

104
00:04:16.445 --> 00:04:18.485
This week is so action-packed.

105
00:04:18.485 --> 00:04:19.865
We have not just five,

106
00:04:19.865 --> 00:04:24.215
but six videos for you covering
creating pivot tables,

107
00:04:24.215 --> 00:04:27.245
formatting, grouping
and sorting data,

108
00:04:27.245 --> 00:04:28.715
filtering data,

109
00:04:28.715 --> 00:04:32.255
calculated fields in
items, and pivot charts.

110
00:04:32.255 --> 00:04:33.965
If you are new to pivots,

111
00:04:33.965 --> 00:04:35.480
don't feel overwhelmed,

112
00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.990
download the quick reference
guide to help you,

113
00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.700
and of course we have another
practice challenge where

114
00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:43.835
you can apply these skills
in a different context.

115
00:04:43.835 --> 00:04:47.420
There's also an assessment
this week covering content

116
00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:52.230
from week 3 and this week,
so, keep practicing.
