00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:07.830
In this video, we're going
to look at how we can

2
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.265
summarize large amounts of
data using a PivotTable.

3
00:00:12.265 --> 00:00:14.780
Rowan has been presented
with this set of

4
00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.465
renewable energy data
and asked to create

5
00:00:17.465 --> 00:00:19.670
a series of visualizations to

6
00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.540
tell a story about
renewable energy.

7
00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.440
It's quite a lot of data.

8
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.510
If I scroll down to the bottom,

9
00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.660
you see we've got
over 20,000 records,

10
00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.590
so he can't just create a
chart directly on this data.

11
00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.635
He has to somehow summarize it.

12
00:00:36.635 --> 00:00:40.160
He could do this with
a sum-ifs calculation,

13
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.980
but it's going to require
a little bit of setup,

14
00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.170
some tricky
calculations, and it's

15
00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.425
not going to be very
easy to change.

16
00:00:47.425 --> 00:00:48.950
We're going to look at

17
00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.350
a really powerful and easy way of

18
00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.045
doing this using a PivotTable.

19
00:00:55.045 --> 00:00:58.100
Before we can create
a PivotTable,

20
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.960
it is quite important that
you have nice clean data

21
00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.330
organized into columns with

22
00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.075
no blank rows and
no blank columns.

23
00:01:07.075 --> 00:01:09.010
You can have blank cells,

24
00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:10.330
but it's really important that

25
00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.790
columns containing numeric data,

26
00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.650
only contain numeric data.

27
00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.530
A strong recommendation as well,

28
00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.795
is that you convert
your data to a table.

29
00:01:20.795 --> 00:01:23.815
This has two
advantages: it will be

30
00:01:23.815 --> 00:01:27.100
easier to refer to the data
when creating the pivot,

31
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.575
but more importantly,
it will make

32
00:01:29.575 --> 00:01:32.735
updating the pivots
far more efficient.

33
00:01:32.735 --> 00:01:35.395
So click somewhere in your data.

34
00:01:35.395 --> 00:01:38.440
We're going to come
to the Insert tab,

35
00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:44.640
click on the Table icon and
press Enter or click okay.

36
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.795
We're going to give our
table name as well.

37
00:01:47.795 --> 00:01:51.470
So on the table design
ribbon, on the left,

38
00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.150
we're going to call it
tblRE, and press "Enter."

39
00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:01.200
It's a good idea to go for
something quite easy to type.

40
00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.680
Our data is now all setup,

41
00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.880
and we're going to come
to our Insert tab again.

42
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.395
On the far left,

43
00:02:09.395 --> 00:02:12.560
you'll see the Insert PivotTable,

44
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.375
which is what we're
going to do next.

45
00:02:15.375 --> 00:02:17.990
Before you create a
PivotTable, however,

46
00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:19.670
you need to have a question in

47
00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.175
mind that you want
to have answered.

48
00:02:22.175 --> 00:02:24.580
What Rowan would like to know is;

49
00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:25.940
what is the breakdown of

50
00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.790
electricity capacity
from renewable,

51
00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.940
RE, versus non-renewable,
NONRE, technologies?

52
00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.020
We're going to
answer that question

53
00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.140
with just four clicks.

54
00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.055
I'm going to click
on the PivotTable,

55
00:02:41.055 --> 00:02:43.785
and it's picked up my
data-set automatically,

56
00:02:43.785 --> 00:02:46.100
which is great and I would

57
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.709
like to put this into
a new worksheet,

58
00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.085
so I'm just going
to click "Okay."

59
00:02:51.085 --> 00:02:53.510
What happened here is Excel has

60
00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.865
given us a place
holder, which says,

61
00:02:55.865 --> 00:02:57.905
"I know you want a PivotTable,

62
00:02:57.905 --> 00:03:01.375
but what do you want this
PivotTable to look like?"

63
00:03:01.375 --> 00:03:04.150
We design the PivotTable

64
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.700
using the Field List on
the right-hand side.

65
00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.185
Each of the columns from

66
00:03:09.185 --> 00:03:12.260
our original data-set
is represented,

67
00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.895
and we just choose what data
we want to see in our pivot.

68
00:03:16.895 --> 00:03:20.690
I would like to see my
total electricity capacity,

69
00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.350
so I'm going to take that
and you'll see it's actually

70
00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:28.385
summed up the electricity
capacity from our raw data.

71
00:03:28.385 --> 00:03:30.710
But I actually want
that broken down

72
00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:34.385
by renewable versus
non-renewable.

73
00:03:34.385 --> 00:03:37.840
Four clicks, too easy.

74
00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.090
Let's take a moment to see what's

75
00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:41.935
happening on the right-hand side.

76
00:03:41.935 --> 00:03:45.265
When I choose a value that
contains numeric data,

77
00:03:45.265 --> 00:03:47.050
it automatically puts it in

78
00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.540
the values quadrant
and sums it up.

79
00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.380
When I choose a column that
contains non-numeric data,

80
00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.580
it automatically puts it in
the rows quadrant and takes

81
00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.050
each unique value from

82
00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.225
that column and makes
it a raw label.

83
00:04:02.225 --> 00:04:04.275
As well as the Field List,

84
00:04:04.275 --> 00:04:05.640
you will notice we get

85
00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.725
two new ribbons: PivotTable
Analyze and Design.

86
00:04:10.725 --> 00:04:13.500
On the PivotTable Analyze ribbon,

87
00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.660
we have the option to
give our pivot a name,

88
00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.575
which is actually a good idea,

89
00:04:18.575 --> 00:04:19.750
so I'm going to click into

90
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.765
the box and I'm
going to type pvt,

91
00:04:22.765 --> 00:04:26.015
and this is just going to
be our renewable energy,

92
00:04:26.015 --> 00:04:29.715
so RE, and then you
can press "Enter."

93
00:04:29.715 --> 00:04:32.360
We should probably rename
the sheet as well,

94
00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.450
so I'm going to double-click
where it says Sheet 1,

95
00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:40.060
and this is going to
be RE versus NONRE.

96
00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.700
You've also got to be for
color-coding system going on,

97
00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.190
so I'm going to
right-click on that,

98
00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.235
come to my tab Color
and make that blue,

99
00:04:49.235 --> 00:04:53.300
so I can distinguish
between pivots and data.

100
00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.465
Now let's create
another PivotTable.

101
00:04:56.465 --> 00:05:00.140
This time Rowan wants to
see similar information,

102
00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.580
but broken down by region.

103
00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.160
So back in our renewable
energy worksheet,

104
00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.600
I'm going to click into

105
00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.225
the data and come
to our insert tab.

106
00:05:11.225 --> 00:05:14.549
If you have one of the
newer versions of Excel,

107
00:05:14.549 --> 00:05:16.755
you may notice you've also got

108
00:05:16.755 --> 00:05:19.455
a recommended PivotTables Option.

109
00:05:19.455 --> 00:05:21.960
This can be a really quick way of

110
00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.995
getting the pivot
information that you want,

111
00:05:24.995 --> 00:05:27.879
and you see there's
exactly the PivotTable

112
00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:29.725
I was hoping to create.

113
00:05:29.725 --> 00:05:32.170
So I could just click on it.

114
00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:34.150
For practice though, and for

115
00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:35.830
those people who don't have the

116
00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:39.445
recommended pivots I'm not
going to do it that way today.

117
00:05:39.445 --> 00:05:41.420
I'm going to click cancel,

118
00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:45.280
and I'm going to come back
to the PivotTable button.

119
00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.625
Again, we're going to
do it from scratch.

120
00:05:48.625 --> 00:05:50.980
So same data range.

121
00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.140
But this time I want to put

122
00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:56.290
my pivot into an
existing worksheet.

123
00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:58.690
I could put it in this one,

124
00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:00.610
but they take a bit of space.

125
00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.715
So I'm still going to put
it in its own worksheet,

126
00:06:03.715 --> 00:06:08.185
but I'm going to put it
into capacity by region.

127
00:06:08.185 --> 00:06:10.870
We're going to click
on that sheet,

128
00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.405
we're going to add
some filters later.

129
00:06:13.405 --> 00:06:14.500
So we're going to leave

130
00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:16.420
some space and I'm
going to choose

131
00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:21.670
cell A3 and I'm
going to say okay.

132
00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:23.635
Very similar to last time,

133
00:06:23.635 --> 00:06:26.095
we're going to
choose our capacity

134
00:06:26.095 --> 00:06:28.840
and we're going to
choose our region,

135
00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:32.110
and there's a
breakdown by region.

136
00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:35.245
But I would also
like to see a split

137
00:06:35.245 --> 00:06:38.590
between the RE and the non-RE.

138
00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:40.795
When I select it however,

139
00:06:40.795 --> 00:06:43.045
it does exactly
what I said before.

140
00:06:43.045 --> 00:06:45.760
It automatically adds
it to the rows column,

141
00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:49.120
and you'll see it's added
it underneath the region.

142
00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.220
We can reposition it however.

143
00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:55.475
So I click and drag that
to above the region,

144
00:06:55.475 --> 00:06:57.085
which looks pretty good,

145
00:06:57.085 --> 00:07:01.420
or alternatively, I can put
it into the columns quadrant.

146
00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:03.550
So I'm going to grab the RE and

147
00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:07.445
non-RE and drag it
into the columns.

148
00:07:07.445 --> 00:07:11.125
Now you see why it's
called a PivotTable,

149
00:07:11.125 --> 00:07:14.560
because you can easily
pivot this information,

150
00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.690
turn the data around to

151
00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:19.555
see it in whichever
form you needed to.

152
00:07:19.555 --> 00:07:22.230
Let's give this one
a name as well.

153
00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:24.695
So coming into the name section,

154
00:07:24.695 --> 00:07:28.525
I'm just going to
call this pvtRegion,

155
00:07:28.525 --> 00:07:32.805
and we're just going to create
one last example today.

156
00:07:32.805 --> 00:07:35.935
This time, however,
we're going to start by

157
00:07:35.935 --> 00:07:38.770
clicking into this sheet
where we wanted to go,

158
00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:41.985
and again, I'm
going to choose A3.

159
00:07:41.985 --> 00:07:44.950
I'm going to come to insert,

160
00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:47.890
and I'm going to
choose PivotTable.

161
00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:50.680
This time it knows
where to put it,

162
00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:53.355
but it doesn't know
where to get the data.

163
00:07:53.355 --> 00:07:56.605
Fortunately, it
comes from a table.

164
00:07:56.605 --> 00:08:01.255
So we can just type
tblRE and press Enter.

165
00:08:01.255 --> 00:08:04.615
So there's another way
of creating the pivot,

166
00:08:04.615 --> 00:08:06.250
you can actually start in

167
00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:09.325
the location and then
specify the data.

168
00:08:09.325 --> 00:08:11.210
For our last pivot,

169
00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:13.975
we would like to see a
breakdown of capacity,

170
00:08:13.975 --> 00:08:17.365
but this time by
technology and year.

171
00:08:17.365 --> 00:08:20.080
So we are going to take capacity

172
00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:23.470
and then I'm going to
take main technology.

173
00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:25.000
But it's hard to see what's

174
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.685
renewable and what's
non-renewable,

175
00:08:27.685 --> 00:08:31.250
so I'm going to grab
my RE or non-RE,

176
00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:33.380
but this time rather
than ticking,

177
00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:35.170
I'm going to click and

178
00:08:35.170 --> 00:08:37.915
drag it straight to
where I wanted to go,

179
00:08:37.915 --> 00:08:40.905
and finally, I need
to see my year.

180
00:08:40.905 --> 00:08:42.845
But we have to be a
little careful with

181
00:08:42.845 --> 00:08:44.960
this one if I just tick it,

182
00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:47.530
because the year is
actually a number,

183
00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:50.820
you can see it's added
to my values quadrant,

184
00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:52.810
which is not what I want.

185
00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:54.785
So I'm just going to grab it from

186
00:08:54.785 --> 00:08:58.475
values and put it into columns.

187
00:08:58.475 --> 00:09:01.945
I could of course have
done that directly.

188
00:09:01.945 --> 00:09:04.895
Now a few things
before we wrap up.

189
00:09:04.895 --> 00:09:08.565
If I want to remove a
value from my PivotTable,

190
00:09:08.565 --> 00:09:10.630
I can unselect it or I can

191
00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:13.225
grab it and drop
it off the pivot.

192
00:09:13.225 --> 00:09:15.655
So easy in, easy out.

193
00:09:15.655 --> 00:09:17.605
I do actually want that,

194
00:09:17.605 --> 00:09:19.405
so I put it back in.

195
00:09:19.405 --> 00:09:21.940
If I click away from the pivot,

196
00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:25.025
both the ribbons and
the field list vanish,

197
00:09:25.025 --> 00:09:26.830
and when I click back,

198
00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:28.790
of course they reappear.

199
00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:31.300
But because this takes up space,

200
00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:33.190
you may at some point decide to

201
00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:35.495
hit the cross and close it,

202
00:09:35.495 --> 00:09:38.600
and now it's gone. That's okay.

203
00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:42.190
To get it back on your
PivotTable, analyze.

204
00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:43.855
On the right-hand side,

205
00:09:43.855 --> 00:09:45.760
you'll see an option to show

206
00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:49.925
the field list and when
you turn that on its back.

207
00:09:49.925 --> 00:09:54.595
So this allows you to turn
on and off your field list.

208
00:09:54.595 --> 00:09:57.805
Finally, let's give
this pivot a name.

209
00:09:57.805 --> 00:10:00.245
So we are going to
come up to the ribbon.

210
00:10:00.245 --> 00:10:03.710
I'm going to call this pvtYear,

211
00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:06.685
and there's our last PivotTable.

212
00:10:06.685 --> 00:10:08.635
In the next video,

213
00:10:08.635 --> 00:10:10.850
we're going to look
at how we can format

214
00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:15.100
our pivots and change
the calculations.
