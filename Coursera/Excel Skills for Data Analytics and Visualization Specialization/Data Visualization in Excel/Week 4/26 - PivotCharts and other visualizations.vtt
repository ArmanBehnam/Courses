00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:07.320
In the last few videos,

2
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.210
we've seen how pivot tables will

3
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.100
allow us to create
powerful analytics.

4
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.350
But often, we need
to quickly absorb

5
00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:16.170
that information and make

6
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.725
those split-second
determinations.

7
00:00:18.725 --> 00:00:22.950
For that, we need a pivot chart
or another visualization.

8
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:26.700
When we think pivot tables and
visualizations, typically,

9
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.410
we do think pivot charts,

10
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.390
but we do have some other options

11
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.470
which you would like
to look at first.

12
00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.305
One of them is
conditional formatting.

13
00:00:35.305 --> 00:00:38.120
Now, we're in the
Investment tab arrow,

14
00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.340
and would like to add
a conditional format

15
00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:41.480
that demonstrates

16
00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.580
the proportion of investment in

17
00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.115
a particular country
compared to the others.

18
00:00:46.115 --> 00:00:49.430
We could add it directly
to the data here,

19
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.150
but we actually wanted
added in a separate column.

20
00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.310
We're going to grab our amount in

21
00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.500
US dollar millions and

22
00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.475
just pop it into the
values column again.

23
00:01:00.475 --> 00:01:02.895
We've actually got it twice.

24
00:01:02.895 --> 00:01:05.600
Before we add our
conditional format,

25
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.645
it's a good idea to
remove any raw filters.

26
00:01:08.645 --> 00:01:10.595
Otherwise, you will only end up

27
00:01:10.595 --> 00:01:12.755
adding it to the visible cells.

28
00:01:12.755 --> 00:01:14.885
Coming to our row labels,

29
00:01:14.885 --> 00:01:17.250
I'm going to come to
"Clear Filter from

30
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.205
Recipient Country" to
remove the filter.

31
00:01:20.205 --> 00:01:22.295
Two more little tweaks.

32
00:01:22.295 --> 00:01:25.235
We're going to come
to our "Design" tab.

33
00:01:25.235 --> 00:01:29.315
I'm going to turn our row
and column totals of,

34
00:01:29.315 --> 00:01:31.625
and on our Data tab,

35
00:01:31.625 --> 00:01:34.910
we're going to sort
largest to smallest.

36
00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.380
We're now set up,

37
00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.400
and we're going to add
our visualization.

38
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.915
As we would with normal data,

39
00:01:41.915 --> 00:01:44.060
we're going to click into C4

40
00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.615
and press Control
Shift Down Arrow.

41
00:01:46.615 --> 00:01:48.975
Then coming to the "Home" tab,

42
00:01:48.975 --> 00:01:52.385
we're going to come to the
Conditional Formatting button.

43
00:01:52.385 --> 00:01:55.720
You can add any of these
conditional formats.

44
00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.600
But the one we want to
use today is a data bar.

45
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.005
Choose the color you like,

46
00:02:02.005 --> 00:02:03.705
and there he go.

47
00:02:03.705 --> 00:02:06.330
Lets make a small
modification to it.

48
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.185
I'm going to come back to
conditional formatting.

49
00:02:09.185 --> 00:02:12.125
We're going to come
to "Manage Rules",

50
00:02:12.125 --> 00:02:15.290
and we're going to
double-click our rule,

51
00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.820
and we get the full set of

52
00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.040
customizations available as well.

53
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.825
I'm going to change the color

54
00:02:20.825 --> 00:02:23.045
so it ties in with my theme.

55
00:02:23.045 --> 00:02:26.245
I'm going to choose
"Show Bar Only",

56
00:02:26.245 --> 00:02:29.475
and then I'm going to
say "Okay" and "Okay".

57
00:02:29.475 --> 00:02:32.265
Very simple way of
adding a visualization.

58
00:02:32.265 --> 00:02:35.340
Let's change the heading.
This is going to

59
00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.400
be investment in millions.

60
00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.420
Interestingly, you can also add

61
00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.045
custom number format
to a visualization,

62
00:02:44.045 --> 00:02:45.380
which can be handy when

63
00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.180
the conditional
formatting doesn't

64
00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.650
give you what you need.

65
00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.400
Let's go and add our
amount in millions, again,

66
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.054
to our values quadrants,

67
00:02:54.054 --> 00:02:57.865
and we're going to call
this one Target met.

68
00:02:57.865 --> 00:03:01.040
What we would like to
be able to see here

69
00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.675
is whether they've achieved
their annual target.

70
00:03:04.675 --> 00:03:07.470
So 900 million is the target,

71
00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:08.885
and if we hit it,

72
00:03:08.885 --> 00:03:11.110
we want to see a
green smiley face,

73
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.275
and if we don't,

74
00:03:12.275 --> 00:03:14.915
we actually want to
leave the cell empty.

75
00:03:14.915 --> 00:03:17.800
I'm going to select the data.

76
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.880
We're going to come up to

77
00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.870
our Number format group and
click the dialogue launcher,

78
00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.635
or you may remember the
keyboard shortcut, Control 1.

79
00:03:27.635 --> 00:03:29.510
I want to custom format.

80
00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.520
To make life a little easier,

81
00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.175
we've already added it.

82
00:03:33.175 --> 00:03:36.524
We're going for color 14,

83
00:03:36.524 --> 00:03:39.510
values that are greater than 900,

84
00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.150
and where that's true,

85
00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.490
we want to see a smiley face.

86
00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:45.500
I'm going to say, "Okay",

87
00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.745
and there's our
custom number format.

88
00:03:48.745 --> 00:03:52.520
If we then want to filter the
data to show the values for

89
00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:57.235
2011, both immediately
recalculate.

90
00:03:57.235 --> 00:03:59.885
That's a couple of
creative ideas.

91
00:03:59.885 --> 00:04:03.470
Let's now see how we
create a pivot chart.

92
00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.350
For this, we are going
to come to the next tab,

93
00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.640
which is capacity by year.

94
00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.330
Click somewhere
into the pivot data

95
00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.730
and to create a pivot chart,

96
00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.000
we come to our
"PivotTable Analyze" tab.

97
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.160
In the Tools group, we're
going to select "PivotChart".

98
00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.045
It looks like we're getting

99
00:04:23.045 --> 00:04:26.780
all the same options as we
do with regular charts.

100
00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.855
While pivot charts are very
similar to irregular charts,

101
00:04:29.855 --> 00:04:32.600
there are two
distinct differences.

102
00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.725
The first is that we can't
use all the same chart types.

103
00:04:36.725 --> 00:04:38.480
We can use the normal ones,

104
00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.375
so everything from
column down to area.

105
00:04:41.375 --> 00:04:45.455
But if I try to
use an XY scatter,

106
00:04:45.455 --> 00:04:47.735
you see that's grayed out,

107
00:04:47.735 --> 00:04:49.325
and it's the same case for

108
00:04:49.325 --> 00:04:51.895
everything else
underneath as well.

109
00:04:51.895 --> 00:04:53.660
The other difference is that when

110
00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.475
we create a normal chart,

111
00:04:55.475 --> 00:04:57.410
we select some cells,

112
00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:00.370
and we chart the
data of those cells.

113
00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.090
A pivot chart is

114
00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.270
a graphical representation
of a pivot table.

115
00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.590
You can't select part
of a pivot table.

116
00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.240
If the pivot table changes,

117
00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.120
the chart will change,
and vice versa.

118
00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.040
Outside of that,
you will find that

119
00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.010
pivot charts are very
much like regular charts.

120
00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:21.455
The one we want is
a stacked column.

121
00:05:21.455 --> 00:05:23.210
We're going to come to "Column",

122
00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:24.990
and choose "Stacked Column",

123
00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:26.880
and then we're going
to say "Okay".

124
00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.845
Here is our pivot chart.

125
00:05:29.845 --> 00:05:32.390
It looks very similar
to a regular chart,

126
00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:34.520
but probably the first
thing you'll notice

127
00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.875
is that you get
these field buttons,

128
00:05:36.875 --> 00:05:40.505
and these allow us to interact
with the pivot chart,

129
00:05:40.505 --> 00:05:43.070
just like you would
with a pivot table.

130
00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:44.645
On the right-hand side,

131
00:05:44.645 --> 00:05:46.340
our pivot table fields have been

132
00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.250
replaced with pivot chart fields.

133
00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.485
But you'll see instead of column,

134
00:05:51.485 --> 00:05:55.880
we have legend and instead
of row, we have axis.

135
00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:59.180
Let's start by getting familiar
with the field buttons,

136
00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.640
and the first one I'd
like to show you are

137
00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.505
these two at the bottom
right-hand corner,

138
00:06:04.505 --> 00:06:07.445
which had been added with
the newer version of Excel,

139
00:06:07.445 --> 00:06:09.080
so you might not have these

140
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.435
if you've got a
slightly older version.

141
00:06:11.435 --> 00:06:14.750
Wherever you have multiple
values in your axis,

142
00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:16.535
you actually get a hierarchy,

143
00:06:16.535 --> 00:06:20.390
and these allow you to expand
or collapse that hierarchy.

144
00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:22.775
If I click on the plus,

145
00:06:22.775 --> 00:06:25.100
you'll see it's
expanded to show me

146
00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.890
all the Renewable
and Non-Renewable,

147
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:29.300
and you'll notice that

148
00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.865
the pivot table has
changed as well.

149
00:06:31.865 --> 00:06:33.860
If I click the minus,

150
00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:35.720
it collapses the groups.

151
00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.760
I'm going to expand them again,

152
00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:41.225
but I don't actually want
to see the Non-Renewable,

153
00:06:41.225 --> 00:06:42.680
and for each of the fields

154
00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.455
represented in the
pivot chart quadrants,

155
00:06:45.455 --> 00:06:47.825
you'll also get a field button.

156
00:06:47.825 --> 00:06:51.335
If I come to RE or Non-RE,

157
00:06:51.335 --> 00:06:54.815
I can actually choose to
not show the Non-Renewable,

158
00:06:54.815 --> 00:06:56.915
and when I say OK,

159
00:06:56.915 --> 00:07:01.310
it is now showing me
the Renewable capacity,

160
00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:04.235
both in my chart and in my table.

161
00:07:04.235 --> 00:07:06.050
It's still got the
hierarchy though,

162
00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:07.460
which I don't want,

163
00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:09.950
so what I'm going to
do is I'm going to

164
00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:12.710
come to my pivot
chart field list,

165
00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:16.475
I'm going to grab
the RE or non-RE,

166
00:07:16.475 --> 00:07:19.460
and drop it into the
filters quadrants.

167
00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:21.290
What that has done is add

168
00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:23.705
a filter to the top of my chart.

169
00:07:23.705 --> 00:07:26.630
I no longer have that hierarchy.

170
00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:28.910
I can also filter by

171
00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:32.615
either my axis categories
or my legend series.

172
00:07:32.615 --> 00:07:35.104
Come into my year, for example,

173
00:07:35.104 --> 00:07:39.900
I could choose to just
see the data for 2001,

174
00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:46.595
and that chart is looking
a lot more sensible.

175
00:07:46.595 --> 00:07:48.545
To clear the filter,

176
00:07:48.545 --> 00:07:53.070
I click the drop-down and click
Clear Filter from "Year".

177
00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:55.390
This chart however, is not

178
00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:57.805
actually showing me
what I want to see.

179
00:07:57.805 --> 00:08:00.490
I would like to see my year on

180
00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:03.945
my axis and my
technology as a series,

181
00:08:03.945 --> 00:08:05.855
so what I really want to do

182
00:08:05.855 --> 00:08:08.135
is swap these two values around,

183
00:08:08.135 --> 00:08:10.010
and I could do it by just

184
00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:12.845
dragging like I would
in a pivot table,

185
00:08:12.845 --> 00:08:16.145
but pivot charts give
us another option.

186
00:08:16.145 --> 00:08:19.745
I'm going to come up
to my Design tab,

187
00:08:19.745 --> 00:08:21.500
and in the data group,

188
00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:25.205
I can switch my row/column data,

189
00:08:25.205 --> 00:08:28.190
and when I do, you'll
see it's switched in

190
00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:31.655
my table and my chart
now looks much better.

191
00:08:31.655 --> 00:08:33.005
On the Design tab,

192
00:08:33.005 --> 00:08:36.440
we have all the same tools
as with regular charts.

193
00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:39.890
For example, I could go
in and style my chart,

194
00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:42.500
I could change my chart type,

195
00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:44.750
I could change the colors,

196
00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:48.035
I could add or remove
chart elements,

197
00:08:48.035 --> 00:08:50.720
I also have the Chart
Element button here,

198
00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:53.510
and I can come and
move my legend,

199
00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:56.255
so I'm going to put
that at the top,

200
00:08:56.255 --> 00:08:58.910
I'm going to switch
off my grid lines,

201
00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:01.670
I could add a chart
title if I wanted to,

202
00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:03.230
and I have the other options for

203
00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:05.390
formatting by chart as well.

204
00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:07.310
For example, if I come to

205
00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:09.755
my vertical axis
and double-click,

206
00:09:09.755 --> 00:09:12.530
that will open up my
former access panel,

207
00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:15.500
and I'd like to show
this in thousands.

208
00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:18.770
I'd also like to
change my gap width.

209
00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:20.810
I'm going to click on one of

210
00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:24.680
my bars and I'm going to
make that 50 percent.

211
00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:28.145
My dates are looking
very squashed,

212
00:09:28.145 --> 00:09:31.850
so I'm going to make a bit
of a change to that as well.

213
00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:34.744
Clicking on to the
horizontal axis,

214
00:09:34.744 --> 00:09:37.520
we're going to come
to Axis Options,

215
00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:40.730
Size and Properties,
and we're going

216
00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:43.970
to change our text
direction to be rotated.

217
00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:45.500
Then I'm going to close up

218
00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:48.380
that panel because that's
looking pretty good.

219
00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:50.450
I just have one concern though,

220
00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:52.770
and that's these field buttons.

221
00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:56.004
While they do allow me to
interact with the chart,

222
00:09:56.004 --> 00:09:58.915
they take up quite a
lot of chart space,

223
00:09:58.915 --> 00:10:01.615
and if I decide to
print this chart,

224
00:10:01.615 --> 00:10:04.020
there actually going to print.

225
00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:06.980
The good news is we
can turn them off,

226
00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:11.270
and we do that by coming to
our Pivot Chart Analyze tab,

227
00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:13.100
and on the far right,

228
00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:15.185
you'll see Field Buttons,

229
00:10:15.185 --> 00:10:16.895
if you click the Drop-down,

230
00:10:16.895 --> 00:10:20.300
you can actually select which
ones you want to turn off.

231
00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:24.110
Alternatively, if you click
the top part of the button,

232
00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:27.485
you can turn them all
off with one click,

233
00:10:27.485 --> 00:10:30.575
and there's our
completed pivot chart.

234
00:10:30.575 --> 00:10:32.525
Everyone say, wow.

235
00:10:32.525 --> 00:10:35.660
We've only had the
time to create one,

236
00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:38.390
but we'll give you more
opportunities to create

237
00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:41.315
them in this week's
practice challenge,

238
00:10:41.315 --> 00:10:46.110
so don't forget to check
the practice challenge out.
