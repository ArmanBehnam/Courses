1
00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:05.100
Last week was awesome.

2
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.840
We focused on the process of

3
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.570
preparing data
using pivot tables,

4
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.580
And then we saw how
we could visualize

5
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.964
that data using pivot charts.

6
00:00:13.964 --> 00:00:16.335
But having these charts
scattered around

7
00:00:16.335 --> 00:00:19.915
our workbook doesn't tell
a very cohesive story.

8
00:00:19.915 --> 00:00:21.860
That's true. This week,

9
00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.540
we're going to look at how
to put it all together

10
00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.700
and create an
attractive dashboard.

11
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.680
This will partly serve
as a practical approach

12
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.630
to creating dashboards in Excel,

13
00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.240
but I also want to use
it as an opportunity to

14
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.215
practice many of the topics
from earlier in this course.

15
00:00:35.215 --> 00:00:36.980
A dashboard is a great tool for

16
00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.040
information management and
business intelligence.

17
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.900
It allows us to store and

18
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.910
display important
information from

19
00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.080
multiple data sources in
one ease to access place.

20
00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.645
But most people have
never created one.

21
00:00:50.645 --> 00:00:53.255
Nikki, what makes
a good dashboard?

22
00:00:53.255 --> 00:00:55.220
Well, an effective
dashboard should be

23
00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.650
striking, but visually balanced,

24
00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.740
user-friendly, and
tailored to your goals,

25
00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.725
as well as your audience.

26
00:01:02.725 --> 00:01:06.260
What are your top tips
for achieving this?

27
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.070
Most importantly, start
with a clear goal in mind.

28
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.620
Then make sure you choose
the right metrics and

29
00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.365
provide good context
for those metrics.

30
00:01:15.365 --> 00:01:18.825
Give some consideration
to colors and layout,

31
00:01:18.825 --> 00:01:21.545
and make sure you use the
right visualizations.

32
00:01:21.545 --> 00:01:24.085
This may require
a few iterations.

33
00:01:24.085 --> 00:01:27.484
Where possible, provide
interactive elements

34
00:01:27.484 --> 00:01:29.750
and remember more is less.

35
00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.910
We need it to fit
onto a single screen

36
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.555
or single sheet and
not feel crowded.

37
00:01:34.555 --> 00:01:36.680
Getting down to the mechanics,

38
00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.450
we've collected our data,

39
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.385
cleaned and consolidated it,

40
00:01:40.385 --> 00:01:42.695
and created a mix
of useful metrics.

41
00:01:42.695 --> 00:01:44.510
We're ready for
that cherry on top,

42
00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:45.910
but where to begin?

43
00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.315
I would recommend starting
with wire framing.

44
00:01:48.315 --> 00:01:50.540
That's the process of
designing the layout.

45
00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.295
This will let you get feedback,

46
00:01:52.295 --> 00:01:55.310
but it will also give you a
chance to focus on the flow.

47
00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.980
For example, if your
audience read left to right,

48
00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.140
you need to dashboard
to flow left to right.

49
00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.000
You need to make sure
that you've sequenced

50
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.010
the most important
things near the top,

51
00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:05.630
and you need to make sure that

52
00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.455
related items are
close to each other.

53
00:02:08.455 --> 00:02:11.390
Now, there are a lot of wire
framing tools out there.

54
00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.145
Any that you would recommend?

55
00:02:13.145 --> 00:02:14.885
Actually, pens on paper,

56
00:02:14.885 --> 00:02:16.685
or whiteboard and markers.

57
00:02:16.685 --> 00:02:18.950
They're the best options
because they free you up from

58
00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.855
the technical limitations
of your tools

59
00:02:20.855 --> 00:02:23.575
and they actually encourage
you to think visually.

60
00:02:23.575 --> 00:02:26.885
Very important that we have
a design in place first.

61
00:02:26.885 --> 00:02:29.434
Now, we're ready to
create our dashboard.

62
00:02:29.434 --> 00:02:31.040
It can be tricky getting

63
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.930
all our column widths and
row heights just right.

64
00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.370
I agree. Another approach

65
00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.140
and one I would
generally recommend

66
00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.950
is to just use image objects
like shapes and charts,

67
00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.685
that actually sit
above the cells.

68
00:02:45.685 --> 00:02:47.780
But what if we need to show

69
00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.265
numeric values,
sparklines or tables?

70
00:02:51.265 --> 00:02:53.060
Well, in Week 1, we saw how we

71
00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.000
could link shapes to
values in a cell,

72
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.675
so we'll recap that.

73
00:02:56.675 --> 00:02:58.010
But we'll also look at

74
00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.840
another great feature
which allows us to

75
00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.230
paste a selection of
cells as a linked image.

76
00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.020
This will work for
sparklines, tables,

77
00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.630
and basically means you
end up with an image that

78
00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.980
will change when the
original data changes.

79
00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.090
We've got our great graphics and

80
00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.360
key metrics all nicely laid out.

81
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.930
How can we add
interactive elements?

82
00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.150
Well, probably the most
important option is to allow

83
00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.240
users to specify what data
values they need to see,

84
00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.579
and for that, we're
going to use slices.

85
00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:30.140
Slices allow us to filter

86
00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.465
data and we'll look at
how we can link them

87
00:03:32.465 --> 00:03:34.070
to multiple sources and

88
00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.845
customize them to fit in with
the look of our dashboard.

89
00:03:36.845 --> 00:03:38.330
We're also going to look at

90
00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.040
working with simple
macros to allow

91
00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.750
users to refresh pivots and
even change the color scheme.

92
00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.260
Love it. One last thing.

93
00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.200
We need to be careful
of not ramming

94
00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.615
too much information
into one sheet.

95
00:03:50.615 --> 00:03:52.910
Does Excel have a
facility to allow us

96
00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.040
to drill down if we
need more detail?

97
00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.830
Well, not in the way
that some tools do,

98
00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:01.070
but the great thing about
Excel is its flexibility.

99
00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:03.920
We're just going to build
a second dashboard and

100
00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.615
employ simple hyperlinks to
facilitate that drill-down.

101
00:04:07.615 --> 00:04:09.885
Everyone, it's our last week,

102
00:04:09.885 --> 00:04:11.390
but we're going to
finish on a high,

103
00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.730
designing our own
stunning dashboard,

104
00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.490
adding charts and
other visualizations,

105
00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:18.560
adding interactive
components, and

106
00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.415
finish it off with
macros and hyperlinks.

107
00:04:21.415 --> 00:04:22.970
The practice challenge calls

108
00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.610
a few additional options
like protection,

109
00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:27.050
so check that out.

110
00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.680
We also have another
creative corner.

111
00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.940
Please contribute
your fabulous ideas

112
00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:33.410
to the community and

113
00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:34.970
don't forget to give a like to

114
00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.550
other people's projects
that inspire you.

115
00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.700
Make a point of
revisiting any topics

116
00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:43.760
you're unsure of before you
attempt the final assessment,

117
00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.520
which will assess the
full course content.

118
00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.335
From me and Nikki,

119
00:04:48.335 --> 00:04:52.710
all the best for your
future Excel endeavors.
