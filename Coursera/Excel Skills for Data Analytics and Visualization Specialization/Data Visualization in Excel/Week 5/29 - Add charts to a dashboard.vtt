1
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.990
In this video, we're going to make our
dashboard come to life by adding charts.

2
00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.231
If your version of Excel
doesn't support map charts,

3
00:00:14.231 --> 00:00:18.820
please make sure you've opened up the ad
chance to a dashboard alt workbook.

4
00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.260
As that will give you an alternative.

5
00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.146
The first chart we want to add to our
dashboard is for global consumption.

6
00:00:26.146 --> 00:00:30.304
To get to the consumption tab, were going
to come to our navigation buttons and

7
00:00:30.304 --> 00:00:31.060
right click.

8
00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.890
I'm going to double click consumption.

9
00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.919
The chart is already been created for
us, so I'm just going to select it and

10
00:00:37.919 --> 00:00:39.648
of course we could copy paste.

11
00:00:39.648 --> 00:00:42.734
But that ends up with a lot of do
bigger chart in your workbook, so

12
00:00:42.734 --> 00:00:44.003
there is another option.

13
00:00:44.003 --> 00:00:47.228
Were going to come up to our
pivot chart design tab and

14
00:00:47.228 --> 00:00:49.436
we're going to select move chart.

15
00:00:49.436 --> 00:00:52.838
This will allow you to move the chart
into its own chart sheet or

16
00:00:52.838 --> 00:00:55.300
embedded in another worksheet.

17
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.512
We'd like to embed options, so
we're going to choose object in,

18
00:00:58.512 --> 00:01:01.770
and were going to scroll up and
select dashboard.

19
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:02.821
Let me click OK.

20
00:01:02.821 --> 00:01:04.853
It brings us to the dashboard and

21
00:01:04.853 --> 00:01:08.020
now all we need to do is
move that chart into place.

22
00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.590
The next one we're going to do is
I'll renewable capacity by year.

23
00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.184
This is the Pivot chart
we created last week.

24
00:01:17.184 --> 00:01:20.601
So we're going to click into
the capacity my year sheet, and

25
00:01:20.601 --> 00:01:24.160
this time we'll just copy paste,
select the chart control C.

26
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.710
Back to our dashboard and
control V to paste.

27
00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.626
The formatting hasn't been done with this
one yet, so a little bit of revision.

28
00:01:35.626 --> 00:01:40.795
We're going to start by coming to
our format ribbon and we're going

29
00:01:40.795 --> 00:01:46.880
to set our shape feel to noPhil and
I'll shape outline to no outline.

30
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.128
Would also like to make our labels
a little bit easier to read,

31
00:01:50.128 --> 00:01:53.262
so coming onto the home tab were
going to come to font color.

32
00:01:53.262 --> 00:01:55.801
The temptation is to go for
bright, vivid white.

33
00:01:55.801 --> 00:01:59.840
But actually it's a good idea to make
your labels a little more muted so

34
00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.905
that they chart detail stands out.

35
00:02:01.905 --> 00:02:03.940
So I'm going to go for
very pale shade of gray.

36
00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.150
Let's resize are chart, so
I'm going to grab the resize handle and

37
00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:15.020
I'm just going to make it to about
just over half the size of the tile.

38
00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.677
And maybe bring it down a little bit.

39
00:02:18.677 --> 00:02:23.027
We don't need a chart title because
we have a label on our tile, so

40
00:02:23.027 --> 00:02:27.471
I'm going to come to my chart elements,
turn the chart title off.

41
00:02:27.471 --> 00:02:30.520
And while I'm here,
I'm going to move the legend to top.

42
00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.636
Now just a few more weeks we need to make,
the axes aren't great.

43
00:02:37.636 --> 00:02:40.960
So I'm going to double
click on my vertical axis.

44
00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.258
Come to my axis options and
change my display units to thousands.

45
00:02:45.258 --> 00:02:46.334
Easy to read.

46
00:02:46.334 --> 00:02:48.520
And ties in a little better
with the chart below.

47
00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.367
The horizontal axis is also
not very easy to read.

48
00:02:53.367 --> 00:02:57.940
So I'm going to select that and
we're going to come to our size and

49
00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.100
properties and
change our text direction to be rotated.

50
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.783
We also want to remove
unnecessary clutter.

51
00:03:07.783 --> 00:03:12.371
So coming to my fill in line options,
I'm going to set it to no line, and

52
00:03:12.371 --> 00:03:15.283
if I click away now it's
looking quite nice.

53
00:03:15.283 --> 00:03:19.020
All right, we can close that
will match a panel for now.

54
00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:23.260
The next chart would like to
add is our capacity by region.

55
00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.458
And again if you are working with
a version that doesn't support map charts,

56
00:03:27.458 --> 00:03:29.986
can you please come to
the capacity by region.

57
00:03:29.986 --> 00:03:34.640
Alt tab as that has an alternative
we've already prepared for you.

58
00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.489
If you are working with
a newer version of Excel.

59
00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:40.594
However, just come to
the capacity by region and

60
00:03:40.594 --> 00:03:43.330
what we'd like to do
is create a map chart.

61
00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.700
As we said last week that isn't
the option to create a pivot chart map.

62
00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:53.987
But what we can do is use simple
calculations to pull the pivot values

63
00:03:53.987 --> 00:03:55.549
into regular cells.

64
00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:59.196
And then create any chart we like,
and that's exactly what Romans done.

65
00:03:59.196 --> 00:04:04.183
I should just point out that he hasn't
just said equals to A5 is actually

66
00:04:04.183 --> 00:04:08.533
put an if statement to check if
there actually is a value in A5.

67
00:04:08.533 --> 00:04:10.700
Because when we filter the data later,

68
00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.071
some of these cells may
end up being empty.

69
00:04:13.071 --> 00:04:17.065
Map charts don't cope well with
zeros in the country names,

70
00:04:17.065 --> 00:04:21.830
so we've just put a blank cell
in there if it's not there.

71
00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:23.085
Now click into data.

72
00:04:23.085 --> 00:04:25.525
We're going to come up to our insert tab.

73
00:04:25.525 --> 00:04:27.268
We're going to come to Maps.

74
00:04:27.268 --> 00:04:29.240
I'm going to choose filled map.

75
00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.966
And there's our map chart.

76
00:04:34.966 --> 00:04:37.431
We're going to make a couple of
changes to this one as well.

77
00:04:37.431 --> 00:04:42.263
So this time will use are controlled 1
keyboard shortcut to open our format chart

78
00:04:42.263 --> 00:04:45.690
area and we're going to come
to options and properties.

79
00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.940
And we're going to click
into the map area.

80
00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.167
And we're going to come to series options,
and

81
00:04:52.167 --> 00:04:54.986
we're going to change our map
projection to the Miller.

82
00:04:54.986 --> 00:05:00.000
And our map area to
only regions with data.

83
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.884
And the reason for that is we'd
like to be able to filter the data.

84
00:05:03.884 --> 00:05:07.562
So for example,
if I filter to only show Eurasia,

85
00:05:11.037 --> 00:05:13.147
It filters the data and
it filters the map.

86
00:05:13.147 --> 00:05:17.697
All right, I'm going to undo that change
because, we want the whole world for now,

87
00:05:17.697 --> 00:05:21.275
and let's copy that map control C and
come to our dashboard.

88
00:05:21.275 --> 00:05:26.031
I'm going to paste it in on the right
hand side of our main tile.

89
00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:34.529
We don't want a chart title,
so I'm going to turn that off.

90
00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:39.356
But we do need to change our formatting,
so I'm going to come to the format tab,

91
00:05:39.356 --> 00:05:43.295
and you'll see it's remembered
my choices from last time, so

92
00:05:43.295 --> 00:05:48.459
I'm just going to click the left half of
shade filter, say no Phil, and no outline.

93
00:05:48.459 --> 00:05:53.357
And we're just going to make this map
a little bit wider, and we actually need

94
00:05:53.357 --> 00:05:58.119
to fit something underneath, so
I'm just going to move that a little bit.

95
00:05:58.119 --> 00:06:02.842
Just looking really good,
now we have one last visualization we

96
00:06:02.842 --> 00:06:06.609
want to add in this video,
called a small multiple.

97
00:06:06.609 --> 00:06:10.666
Small multiples have become
very fashionable in dashboards,

98
00:06:10.666 --> 00:06:15.334
because they allow us to create a grid
of many small charts which let's us

99
00:06:15.334 --> 00:06:17.411
more easily compare datasets.

100
00:06:17.411 --> 00:06:21.890
What Roman would like to be able to do,
is see how the distribution of

101
00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:26.766
renewable versus nonrenewable capacity
has changed over the years, and

102
00:06:26.766 --> 00:06:30.246
he wants to do this using a series,
of donut charts.

103
00:06:30.246 --> 00:06:35.649
The first donut chart, has already been
created, so I'm coming to the 2000 tab,

104
00:06:35.649 --> 00:06:40.461
but we still need one for 2010 and
2019, and we don't want to have to go

105
00:06:40.461 --> 00:06:44.628
through the process of creating and
formatting those two as well.

106
00:06:44.628 --> 00:06:49.320
One of the other differences between
pivot charts and normal charts,

107
00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:53.055
is you can't just link them
to a different data set, but

108
00:06:53.055 --> 00:06:56.237
fortunately, there is
a nifty way round this,

109
00:06:56.237 --> 00:07:01.168
so I'm going to select my donut chart,
and I'm going to copy control+C, and

110
00:07:01.168 --> 00:07:06.296
I'm going to create a brand new workbook
control+N, and Paste Control+V.

111
00:07:06.296 --> 00:07:10.708
That has actually unlinked the chart
from the original pivot data, so

112
00:07:10.708 --> 00:07:14.995
something to be aware of, and
it is converted it to a regular chart.

113
00:07:14.995 --> 00:07:21.025
I'm going to copy it again, control+C,
all tab to go back to my work book and

114
00:07:21.025 --> 00:07:27.090
I'm going to come into the 2010
worksheet and paste that regular chart.

115
00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:32.641
Here's the great thing, if I want to
link a regular chart to a pivot table,

116
00:07:32.641 --> 00:07:35.336
then I can do, and it's very easy.

117
00:07:35.336 --> 00:07:36.559
I come up to chart design,

118
00:07:36.559 --> 00:07:39.564
I come to select data, and
I just click anywhere into the pivot,

119
00:07:39.564 --> 00:07:43.312
and when I say okay, not only does it link
it, but it converted to a pivot chart.

120
00:07:43.312 --> 00:07:49.711
Brilliant, let's do that again,
so my 2019 sheet,

121
00:07:49.711 --> 00:07:54.542
I'm going to paste,
come up to chart design,

122
00:07:54.542 --> 00:08:00.439
click select data,
click into my pivot, and say OK.

123
00:08:00.439 --> 00:08:03.083
Now I have lost a little
bit of formatting,

124
00:08:03.083 --> 00:08:06.608
but I've got a little work around for
that one as well, so

125
00:08:06.608 --> 00:08:11.097
we're going to come back to our 2000
chart, and we're going to copy.

126
00:08:11.097 --> 00:08:16.910
Then we going to come into 2010 and
paste, and you'll see it just paste

127
00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:22.260
the formatting, and same with 2019,
all done really quick.

128
00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.393
We now need to put these three
charts into our dashboard, but

129
00:08:25.393 --> 00:08:28.343
I'd like to avoid having to copy paste,
copy paste, and

130
00:08:28.343 --> 00:08:31.302
there's a great little
efficiency tool here, as well.

131
00:08:31.302 --> 00:08:36.269
We're going to come up to our home tab,
come to our clipboard group,

132
00:08:36.269 --> 00:08:38.507
and open the dialog launcher.

133
00:08:38.507 --> 00:08:42.302
This opens up the clipboard, and
we can see the last thing we copied,

134
00:08:42.302 --> 00:08:46.752
which is our 2000 chart, and typically
that's what the clipboard stores,

135
00:08:46.752 --> 00:08:48.203
the last thing we copied.

136
00:08:48.203 --> 00:08:53.777
But once you open it, you can actually
copy multiple things to the clipboard,

137
00:08:53.777 --> 00:08:58.254
let's have a look, so
I'm going to come to my 2010 sheet,

138
00:08:58.254 --> 00:09:01.815
make sure my chart is selected,
and Control+C.

139
00:09:01.815 --> 00:09:07.542
And then the same with 2019, control+C,
I now have all three on the clipboard and

140
00:09:07.542 --> 00:09:10.459
I can go and
paste all three at the same time.

141
00:09:10.459 --> 00:09:15.684
So I'm going to come back to my dashboard,
and the only thing with this,

142
00:09:15.684 --> 00:09:21.196
is you do need to be on a cell to do it,
so you can't be clicked on your tile.

143
00:09:21.196 --> 00:09:26.422
So I'm just going to click somewhere in
a cell next to my dashboard, and I'm going

144
00:09:26.422 --> 00:09:31.726
to select my 2000 chart first, then I'm
going to click on another blank cell,

145
00:09:31.726 --> 00:09:36.269
and click my 2010, and
then another blank cell and my 2019.

146
00:09:36.269 --> 00:09:40.736
There are my three charts, I'm going to
use my shift key to select them all, and

147
00:09:40.736 --> 00:09:43.090
I'm going to drag them into my dashboard.

148
00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:47.691
Then all I need to do is line them up,
so I'm going to come to shape,

149
00:09:47.691 --> 00:09:49.837
format a line and a line left.

150
00:09:52.487 --> 00:10:00.000
And to label the charts, which is going to
use a text box, and here's one I prepared.

151
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.265
Earlier, so if you just scroll
to the left a little bit,

152
00:10:03.265 --> 00:10:07.293
you'll see a nice big text box and
you can actually just drag that on so

153
00:10:07.293 --> 00:10:10.785
that all the labels are positioned
nicely over the charts.

154
00:10:10.785 --> 00:10:14.766
And you can spend a little bit of
time making that look just right.

155
00:10:18.963 --> 00:10:23.315
Our dashboard is now really starting to
come together and in the next video we're

156
00:10:23.315 --> 00:10:27.550
going to finish off the other two panels
by adding interactive infographics.
