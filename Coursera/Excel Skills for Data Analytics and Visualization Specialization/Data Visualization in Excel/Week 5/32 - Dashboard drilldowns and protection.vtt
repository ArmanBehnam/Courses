00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.870
In our last video, we're going to add
some finishing touches to our dashboard

2
00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.450
using macros, hyperlinks and themes.

3
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.164
The first thing Ron would like to do
is free up a little real estate on

4
00:00:18.164 --> 00:00:18.873
the screen.

5
00:00:18.873 --> 00:00:23.626
We don't really need to see
the 1,2,3,4 a,b,c,d in a dashboard, so

6
00:00:23.626 --> 00:00:27.740
to turn them off you can come to
your view tab and unselect Headings.

7
00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.626
The next thing Ron wants to be able to
do is offer the users a way of drilling

8
00:00:33.626 --> 00:00:37.581
down and seeing more information
about the selected region.

9
00:00:37.581 --> 00:00:40.973
Now he is created the drill
down dashboard already, but

10
00:00:40.973 --> 00:00:45.028
he'd like users to be able to get
there by just clicking on the map.

11
00:00:45.028 --> 00:00:47.490
And we can do this by adding a hyperlink.

12
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.371
Now you can actually add
a hyperlink to a chart, but

13
00:00:52.371 --> 00:00:55.788
Ron wants to constrain
the area to just the plot.

14
00:00:55.788 --> 00:01:01.312
So we're going to use a shape instead,
and we're going to click Insert, Shapes.

15
00:01:01.312 --> 00:01:06.460
Just get a regular rectangle and draw
it to cover the plot area of our chart.

16
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.716
We don't want the shape turn outline,
so let's just switch that off.

17
00:01:11.716 --> 00:01:14.512
And it's tempting to turn
off the fill as well, but

18
00:01:14.512 --> 00:01:18.887
if you do that when they click and it'll
actually click through into the chart.

19
00:01:18.887 --> 00:01:20.495
So we're not going to do that,

20
00:01:20.495 --> 00:01:24.480
we can now press control one
to open up our format panel.

21
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.102
We're going to come to fill, and
we're going to set our transparency 200%.

22
00:01:29.102 --> 00:01:31.902
So the fill is there,
but you can't see it.

23
00:01:31.902 --> 00:01:33.741
Now we will close up the panel.

24
00:01:33.741 --> 00:01:36.580
And now will add the hyper link.

25
00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.879
You can do this by either coming to
the Insert tab and selecting link or

26
00:01:40.879 --> 00:01:43.970
hyperlink depending on your version.

27
00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.718
Or you can just right click on the item
you want to add the hyperlink to and

28
00:01:47.718 --> 00:01:49.730
again just choose link or hyperlink.

29
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.517
You can hyperlink to just about
anything website, another file.

30
00:01:55.517 --> 00:01:59.141
But we want to link to somewhere
else in this document, so

31
00:01:59.141 --> 00:02:02.730
I'm going to select
place in this document.

32
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.953
I'm going to scroll up to
my drill down sheet and

33
00:02:05.953 --> 00:02:10.237
I'm going to make the cell C3
because it's behind the tiles.

34
00:02:10.237 --> 00:02:12.250
And I'm going to say OK.

35
00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.254
Now if I click away for a moment,
bring your cursor back over the map,

36
00:02:16.254 --> 00:02:18.061
you'll see the hand appears.

37
00:02:18.061 --> 00:02:21.430
And when I click,
it takes me to the drill down.

38
00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.442
And Ron has already created a hyperlink
to get us back such as click on the back

39
00:02:25.442 --> 00:02:27.750
button and we're back.

40
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.203
One of the really important things to
remember with both Pivot Tables and

41
00:02:32.203 --> 00:02:35.634
Pivot Charts is that when
the underlying data changes,

42
00:02:35.634 --> 00:02:37.906
they do not automatically refresh.

43
00:02:37.906 --> 00:02:42.056
So it's a really good idea to
give your users an easy way of

44
00:02:42.056 --> 00:02:46.550
refreshing all the Pivot Charts
in your dashboard.

45
00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.310
And we are we going to do
this using a simple macro.

46
00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.582
Now let's set up first, so we're going
to click on one of the Pivot Charts.

47
00:02:54.582 --> 00:02:57.251
And if we come to your
Pivot Chart analyze tab,

48
00:02:57.251 --> 00:03:01.564
what we're going to record ourselves
doing is coming to the refresh button,

49
00:03:01.564 --> 00:03:04.380
clicking the dropdown and
hitting Refresh All.

50
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.541
Now coming back to our Developer tab,
we're going to click Record Macro and

51
00:03:10.541 --> 00:03:12.310
we're going to call it Refresh.

52
00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:14.800
And I'm going to press Enter.

53
00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.760
Now we're going to come to
our Pivot Chart analyze.

54
00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.800
I'm going to click the dropdown.

55
00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.090
Press Refresh All.

56
00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:28.520
And then don't forget to come to
the Developer and click stop recording.

57
00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.940
To run the macro, we're going to give
the users a nice little icon, and

58
00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.667
this is already in your workbooks.

59
00:03:34.667 --> 00:03:37.874
If you just come to
the right of the dashboard,

60
00:03:37.874 --> 00:03:41.970
click and
drag that icon onto your first tile.

61
00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.293
If it goes behind the tile, don't panic.

62
00:03:44.293 --> 00:03:50.610
Just come to Graphics Format, come to
Bring Forward and choose Bring to Front.

63
00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.354
We also need to ungroup
these four objects.

64
00:03:54.354 --> 00:03:56.880
So I'm just going to click Group and
Ungroup.

65
00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.280
And now click away for a moment.

66
00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.940
This is our refresh icon, so to assign the
macro we're going to right click on it.

67
00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.120
Come to Assign Macro.

68
00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.740
And select Refresh and OK.

69
00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.812
Now when the users need to refresh the
dashboard, all they need to do is click on

70
00:04:16.812 --> 00:04:20.330
this icon and it will update
all the charts in the workbook.

71
00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.400
One final feature Ron would like to
include in dashboard is the option to

72
00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.010
switch between a few
different color schemes.

73
00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:36.732
And we're going to do this using
a combination of themes and macros.

74
00:04:36.732 --> 00:04:39.492
Let's start by having
a look at the themes so

75
00:04:39.492 --> 00:04:42.111
the are available on the page layout tab.

76
00:04:42.111 --> 00:04:46.829
And the very first button is called
themes, and when I click the drop down, if

77
00:04:46.829 --> 00:04:51.781
I hover over one of the themes you'll see
the whole look of my dashboard changes.

78
00:04:51.781 --> 00:04:54.351
Themes control the fonts, the colors and

79
00:04:54.351 --> 00:04:57.960
the effects throughout
the entire workbook.

80
00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.027
But because they can change your fonts and
therefore change the sizes,

81
00:05:02.027 --> 00:05:05.027
that can actually throw
your dashboard out of wack.

82
00:05:05.027 --> 00:05:08.972
So for us it will be safer
to just change the colors.

83
00:05:08.972 --> 00:05:13.209
So just to the right of the themes button,
you'll see a colors button and

84
00:05:13.209 --> 00:05:15.791
this gives you quite
a lot of color options.

85
00:05:15.791 --> 00:05:19.418
But if you want to set up your own,
you can.

86
00:05:19.418 --> 00:05:22.530
You do this by coming
to customized colors.

87
00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.388
And here you can come and
set up any color palettes

88
00:05:26.388 --> 00:05:30.420
you like to tie in with your
organization or your branding.

89
00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:35.830
The important ones are the first one,
which is your default text color.

90
00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:40.230
Your six accent colors are the colors you
are going to see in all your graphics, so

91
00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:41.906
your charts and your slices.

92
00:05:41.906 --> 00:05:44.860
And then you have two hyperlink colors.

93
00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.666
We're not actually going to
change any of these, but

94
00:05:47.666 --> 00:05:50.871
we are currently not working
with the standard color set.

95
00:05:50.871 --> 00:05:54.130
So we're going to save it and
we're going to call it Aqua.

96
00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:57.450
And we're just going to click Save.

97
00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:04.308
That color scheme is now available
not only in every Excel workbook, but

98
00:06:04.308 --> 00:06:08.126
across the whole Microsoft Office
suite on your machine.

99
00:06:08.126 --> 00:06:13.371
If you needed to make it available to
other users, if you come to Themes and

100
00:06:13.371 --> 00:06:19.307
save current theme, that will save it as
an external file with the extension thmx.

101
00:06:19.307 --> 00:06:22.171
And you can then distribute
that to other colleagues so

102
00:06:22.171 --> 00:06:24.110
they also have access to that theme.

103
00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:30.548
What we're going to do now is record
ourselves changing the theme colors.

104
00:06:30.548 --> 00:06:34.254
Now I'm just going to click on to
one of the Pivot Charts we can

105
00:06:34.254 --> 00:06:36.990
easily access the refresh button as well.

106
00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:44.954
And we're going to come to our Developer
tab and we're going to click Record Macro.

107
00:06:44.954 --> 00:06:47.230
We're going to call this theme blue.

108
00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:50.230
And I'm going to press Enter.

109
00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:52.735
And then we're going to come
to our page layout tab.

110
00:06:52.735 --> 00:06:56.250
We're going to come to Colors and
I'm going to choose one of the Blues.

111
00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:00.386
And then just to make sure that
everything is nicely refreshed,

112
00:07:00.386 --> 00:07:01.830
I'm gona come to Pivot Chart.

113
00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:05.890
Click the drop down and refresh all.

114
00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:10.360
Then I can come back to my Developer
tab and click stop recording.

115
00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:11.982
All right,
we will repeat that one more time.

116
00:07:11.982 --> 00:07:13.635
So we're going to click Record Macro.

117
00:07:13.635 --> 00:07:15.280
This is going to be theme Aqua.

118
00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:21.514
We're going to come to our Page Layout,
click Colors.

119
00:07:21.514 --> 00:07:29.400
There's our custom Aqua theme, and again,
I'm just going to refresh, so Refresh All.

120
00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:32.621
Come back to Developer, stop recording.

121
00:07:32.621 --> 00:07:35.692
And we already have the macro for
theme green,

122
00:07:35.692 --> 00:07:40.437
so the only thing left to do is to
assign our macros to our color buttons.

123
00:07:40.437 --> 00:07:44.250
So I'm going to click on the first
little circle which is my Aqua.

124
00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:48.660
Right click, Assign Macro and
that's going to be theme Aqua.

125
00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:52.470
And then I'll just repeat that for
the other two buttons.

126
00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:53.840
So next one is blue.

127
00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:58.070
And finally, my green.

128
00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:09.530
Clicking away, let's test that works,
so there's my theme blue.

129
00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:14.840
And there's my theme Aqua.

130
00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:20.740
And that is our finished dashboard.

131
00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:27.122
It's been an exciting few weeks where
we've looked at how we can extract useful

132
00:08:27.122 --> 00:08:29.633
intel for more data using Pivot tables.

133
00:08:29.633 --> 00:08:32.958
Looked at a huge variety of
great visualizations, and

134
00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:38.390
then we've pulled it all together with
a stunning interactive dashboard.

135
00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:40.715
That's all we have to show you for
now, but

136
00:08:40.715 --> 00:08:43.437
we look forward to seeing
what you have to show us.

137
00:08:43.437 --> 00:08:47.128
So if you've had your own ideas or
you created your own dashboards,

138
00:08:47.128 --> 00:08:50.520
would love for you to post them
in this weeks creative corner.

139
00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:56.585
And if you still looking to learn more,
there is more to come.

140
00:08:56.585 --> 00:09:01.437
We have one last course in the
specialization where we're going to unlock

141
00:09:01.437 --> 00:09:05.898
Excels full business intelligence
capability using power query,

142
00:09:05.898 --> 00:09:08.965
power pivot, and
even sneak peek at power BI.

143
00:09:08.965 --> 00:09:10.420
Look forward to seeing you there.
