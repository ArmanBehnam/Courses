00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.460
In this video, we got
to make our dashboards

2
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.010
far more interactive
by adding slices.

3
00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.600
Rowan would like to be
able to filter all of

4
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.160
the visualizations on

5
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.445
the renewable capacity
tile by region.

6
00:00:20.445 --> 00:00:21.920
But because we've turned off

7
00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.450
the field buttons and we

8
00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.050
can't currently see
the PivotTables,

9
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.560
it isn't really possible.

10
00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.115
Fortunately, the solution
is really simple,

11
00:00:29.115 --> 00:00:31.185
we're going to add a slicer.

12
00:00:31.185 --> 00:00:33.990
Now we've actually
seen slices before,

13
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.125
if you come to your
drill down tab,

14
00:00:36.125 --> 00:00:39.125
we've got a slice
of by region here.

15
00:00:39.125 --> 00:00:41.395
If I click Eurasia,

16
00:00:41.395 --> 00:00:44.695
it filters not just this chart,

17
00:00:44.695 --> 00:00:47.480
but all of the visualizations
on this dashboard.

18
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.810
If I click Clear Filter,

19
00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.500
it removes that filter.

20
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.265
We actually need to create
this slice from scratch.

21
00:00:55.265 --> 00:00:57.860
I'm going to select it and press

22
00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.320
delete and then we're

23
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.390
going to come back
to our dashboard.

24
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.210
To add a slicer,
you'll need to select

25
00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.725
either a PivotTable
or a PivotChart.

26
00:01:07.725 --> 00:01:12.905
We're going to select our
capacity by year PivotChart.

27
00:01:12.905 --> 00:01:14.510
Then we're going to come up to

28
00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.690
our PivotChart Analyze tab.

29
00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.340
In the filter group you'll
see there are two slices.

30
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.040
We can add a timeline
slicer which

31
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.175
is great when you need to
filter by date information,

32
00:01:25.175 --> 00:01:29.430
but you have to have complete
dates not just year.

33
00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.500
We have the inserts slice,

34
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.660
this actually allows
you to filter

35
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.790
by any field in your data.

36
00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.790
That's one we're going to go for.

37
00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.190
Now we could add as many
slices as there are fields,

38
00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:41.675
but we just want to region one.

39
00:01:41.675 --> 00:01:44.770
I'm going to take
region and say okay.

40
00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.775
As we saw before,

41
00:01:46.775 --> 00:01:49.730
if I choose one of the
values in the slicers;

42
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.650
Europe for example, it is now

43
00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.415
filtered the data to show
me the values for Europe.

44
00:01:54.415 --> 00:01:56.300
If I wanted to see the values for

45
00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.325
Europe and North America,

46
00:01:58.325 --> 00:02:01.115
if I click the
multi-select button,

47
00:02:01.115 --> 00:02:04.025
that will allow me to
select multiple items.

48
00:02:04.025 --> 00:02:06.260
When I turn them
multi-select off,

49
00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.165
you'll see if I now select Asia,

50
00:02:08.165 --> 00:02:10.190
it clears the amplitude.

51
00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.205
To clear the filter entirely,

52
00:02:12.205 --> 00:02:14.825
I click the Clear Filter.

53
00:02:14.825 --> 00:02:17.325
Incredibly intuitive
to work with.

54
00:02:17.325 --> 00:02:19.620
There just two problems
with this slicer;

55
00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.130
first of all, he doesn't

56
00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.040
really tie in with the
look of my dashboard.

57
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.080
Second of all, it's only

58
00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.105
linked to the one
PivotChart at the moment.

59
00:02:30.105 --> 00:02:31.880
We're going to fix both
of those and we'll

60
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.085
start with the formatting.

61
00:02:34.085 --> 00:02:36.455
Making sure you're
slicer is selected.

62
00:02:36.455 --> 00:02:38.210
We're going to come
up to the slicer

63
00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.320
ribbon and you should see

64
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.540
a gallery of slice's styles on

65
00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.885
the left-hand side and if
you click the drop-down,

66
00:02:44.885 --> 00:02:46.975
it'll give you a
few more options.

67
00:02:46.975 --> 00:02:49.230
The dark options are a
little bit brightest.

68
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.315
If I choose that one,

69
00:02:50.315 --> 00:02:51.800
it looks a little bit nicer,

70
00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.905
but still a lot of white
for this dashboard.

71
00:02:54.905 --> 00:02:56.780
Coming back to my slicer styles,

72
00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.310
I'm going to click the drop-down.

73
00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.310
If you don't like the
options available,

74
00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:02.900
you can either had a brand new

75
00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.580
slicer style where you start from

76
00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.590
scratch and it's
actually quite a lot of

77
00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.855
work or a little bit easier,

78
00:03:08.855 --> 00:03:11.795
grab a slicer style that's
close to what you want,

79
00:03:11.795 --> 00:03:13.310
duplicate it and then

80
00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.645
modify that and that's
what we're going to do.

81
00:03:15.645 --> 00:03:18.560
Coming back to our
dark sky-blue slicer,

82
00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.435
we're going to right-click
and duplicate.

83
00:03:22.435 --> 00:03:25.125
We're going to call this one dash

84
00:03:25.125 --> 00:03:26.900
and then the first
thing we're going to

85
00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.490
change is I'll slice as a whole,

86
00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:31.955
so make sure that's
selected and click Format.

87
00:03:31.955 --> 00:03:35.364
We'd like our fill to be black,

88
00:03:35.364 --> 00:03:37.365
we're going to come to Border.

89
00:03:37.365 --> 00:03:39.675
We don't want a border so
we're going to say none.

90
00:03:39.675 --> 00:03:41.624
Then coming to font,

91
00:03:41.624 --> 00:03:44.160
we're going to make it white and

92
00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.610
size eight and then I'm
going to click Okay.

93
00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.515
We'd also like to change are
selected item with data,

94
00:03:51.515 --> 00:03:53.270
those are the blue buttons,

95
00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:54.965
the one we've
actually highlighted.

96
00:03:54.965 --> 00:03:57.100
I'm going to click Format,

97
00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.375
font is already white
so that's okay,

98
00:04:00.375 --> 00:04:02.720
we don't need to worry
about the border and

99
00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.755
the fill is also fine,
that's all good.

100
00:04:05.755 --> 00:04:08.210
Then the last one
we're going to look at

101
00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:10.580
is an unselected item with Data,

102
00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.410
I'm going to click Format.

103
00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.210
Now, we actually
want these to be a

104
00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:16.100
very dark gray so I'm going to

105
00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.130
choose the dark gray and
let's just check the font.

106
00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.515
Yes, we need that to
be white as well.

107
00:04:22.515 --> 00:04:25.440
Then we're going to say, Okay and

108
00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.760
that's all we need
to do for now so

109
00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.725
I'm going to say, Okay.

110
00:04:28.725 --> 00:04:32.480
Now that style is not actually
being added to this slice

111
00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.335
yet so I'm going to come
back up and under custom,

112
00:04:36.335 --> 00:04:39.035
you'll now see you have
a custom style called

113
00:04:39.035 --> 00:04:42.535
Dash and when you click on
that, you can apply it.

114
00:04:42.535 --> 00:04:45.890
That's looking much
better except with header

115
00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:48.830
where we didn't change our
font color but that's okay,

116
00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.090
because we actually want to turn

117
00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.255
that header off altogether.

118
00:04:52.255 --> 00:04:53.880
To do that, we're
going to come back

119
00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.170
to our slicer ribbon,

120
00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:57.170
come across the
slicer settings on

121
00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:01.005
the far left and
untick display header.

122
00:05:01.005 --> 00:05:02.700
You can also change

123
00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:06.540
your sort order and you can
hide items with no data.

124
00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.780
We don't have any at the
moment but we're going to turn

125
00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.455
that on in case and say, okay.

126
00:05:11.455 --> 00:05:15.350
One final tweak,
slices by default show

127
00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:17.060
the filter options as

128
00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.265
a single column but you
can actually change that.

129
00:05:19.265 --> 00:05:21.470
I'm going to come up to
columns and we're going to

130
00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:23.980
set that to four columns.

131
00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:25.725
Then I'm going to
change my width to

132
00:05:25.725 --> 00:05:29.730
14 and my height to let's say

133
00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:36.825
1.9 it fits and then I can
just move my slice into place.

134
00:05:36.825 --> 00:05:38.865
Formatting all looking great,

135
00:05:38.865 --> 00:05:40.670
now we just need
to see how we can

136
00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:43.375
link it to our other PivotCharts.

137
00:05:43.375 --> 00:05:45.730
With your slicer still selected,

138
00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:47.540
back on your slicer ribbon,

139
00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:49.220
we're going to come to report

140
00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:54.525
connections and this is what
makes slices so brilliant.

141
00:05:54.525 --> 00:05:56.900
You can actually link them to

142
00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.990
any of the PivotTables
and of course,

143
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.330
the related PivotCharts that
share the same pivot cash.

144
00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.830
Usually that means
all the PivotCharts

145
00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:09.290
and slicers from
the same dataset.

146
00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:11.240
This is why it's often

147
00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.430
a good idea to give them
sensible names but in this case,

148
00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:15.290
we actually want to
link it to all of

149
00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:17.255
them so this is not
just going to effect

150
00:06:17.255 --> 00:06:19.560
this dashboard but our drill down

151
00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.845
as well and then we're
going to say, Okay.

152
00:06:22.845 --> 00:06:26.920
If I now select Asia,

153
00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:29.960
it is filtered, not just

154
00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:32.090
my original PivotChart but

155
00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:35.075
all of the charts on this tile.

156
00:06:35.075 --> 00:06:39.515
If I want to deselect
Asia and Eurasia,

157
00:06:39.515 --> 00:06:41.960
I don't have my headers
anymore but I can just use

158
00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.455
my control key and that will
select multiple values.

159
00:06:45.455 --> 00:06:48.635
If I wanted to select
all of them again,

160
00:06:48.635 --> 00:06:50.585
I can click back on Africa,

161
00:06:50.585 --> 00:06:52.190
hold my shift key down,

162
00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:54.125
click on South and
Central America

163
00:06:54.125 --> 00:06:57.250
and it effectively
removes the filter.

164
00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:00.230
Slicers allow us to create

165
00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:04.340
a very intuitive way of
interacting with a dashboard for

166
00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:07.550
your optional homework
add slicer for

167
00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:09.410
our top five
investment and jobs in

168
00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:13.080
renewable energy so they
can be filtered by year.
