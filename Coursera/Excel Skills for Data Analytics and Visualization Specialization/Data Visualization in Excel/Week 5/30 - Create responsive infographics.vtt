00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.190
In this video, we're
going to look at creating

2
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:11.580
interactive infographics
for our dashboards.

3
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.745
We're actually starting
on the drill-down sheet,

4
00:00:14.745 --> 00:00:16.710
which is a second
dashboard one has

5
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.410
created to allow
users to drill down,

6
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.620
and get more detail on
a particular region.

7
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.475
You would like to create
another small multiple.

8
00:00:26.475 --> 00:00:29.960
This time, showing a series
of column charts that

9
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.660
indicate trends for
our top five countries

10
00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.760
in terms of capacity.

11
00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.045
One would like to create
another small multiple,

12
00:00:38.045 --> 00:00:41.750
consisting of five small
column charts that show

13
00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.775
the trends in renewable capacity

14
00:00:43.775 --> 00:00:46.174
for the top five countries.

15
00:00:46.174 --> 00:00:48.590
Creating five column
charts though,

16
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.750
could be quite time-consuming.

17
00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.165
You may recall in the first week,

18
00:00:53.165 --> 00:00:55.700
we had a look at a
very quick way of

19
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.750
creating multiple chance
called a sparkline.

20
00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.945
But you're thinking,
"Hang on a second,

21
00:01:00.945 --> 00:01:03.695
sparklines have to fit
inside a single cell. "

22
00:01:03.695 --> 00:01:06.440
Well, usually yes, but
we're going to look at

23
00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.860
how we can convert a
sparkline to a graphic.

24
00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.560
To do this, we're
going to need to

25
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.810
go to our small
multiples worksheets.

26
00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.790
I'm going to right-click
on my "Navigation" button,

27
00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.505
and I'm going to double-click
"Small Multiples."

28
00:01:21.505 --> 00:01:24.095
We have a pivot table here,

29
00:01:24.095 --> 00:01:26.180
which is showing the trends from

30
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.100
2000-2019 where

31
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.890
our top five countries
were selected region.

32
00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.495
We're going to start by
selecting the data for the US.

33
00:01:34.495 --> 00:01:37.080
Then coming to our Insert tab,

34
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.470
we're going to click
"Column Sparkline."

35
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.010
Now, it's asking us
where we want to put it,

36
00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:44.285
and we want it to go

37
00:01:44.285 --> 00:01:47.605
into "$W$5" so I'm just
going to say, "Okay".

38
00:01:47.605 --> 00:01:49.845
Let's change the color.

39
00:01:49.845 --> 00:01:55.545
Our color is going to
be a light turquoise.

40
00:01:55.545 --> 00:01:57.600
We're going to change
our marker as well.

41
00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.890
We're going to come
to high point,

42
00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.395
and make that a light green.

43
00:02:01.395 --> 00:02:03.800
You may recall that
we can use our fill

44
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.690
handle to copy it down.

45
00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.620
There are all five column charts,

46
00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:12.200
too quick. Let's copy those.

47
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.945
I'm going to press "Control C",

48
00:02:13.945 --> 00:02:16.175
and we're going to
come back to our

49
00:02:16.175 --> 00:02:19.880
drill-down but here comes
the important part.

50
00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.230
We're going to select a cell,

51
00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.819
but instead of just pasting,

52
00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:24.635
because that will
put it in the cells,

53
00:02:24.635 --> 00:02:27.615
we're going to right-click
come to "Paste

54
00:02:27.615 --> 00:02:29.930
Special" and we're
going to choose

55
00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.630
the last option which
is "Linked Picture. "

56
00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.900
What this has done,

57
00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.690
and you could do this
with any cells in Excel,

58
00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.299
is actually created an image

59
00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:44.105
linked back to the
original sparklines.

60
00:02:44.105 --> 00:02:46.810
If they change, this will update.

61
00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.010
We're going to move
them onto the tile now.

62
00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.910
I'm just going to make
that a little bit wider.

63
00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.070
Let's see that interactive part.

64
00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.810
[inaudible] created a slice,

65
00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.135
and we're going to look at
slices more on the next video.

66
00:03:03.135 --> 00:03:05.855
What they allow us to
do is filter data.

67
00:03:05.855 --> 00:03:10.300
This slicer is linked back to
the small multiples pivot,

68
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.785
so when we click on Asia,

69
00:03:12.785 --> 00:03:16.265
it filters the small
multiples pivot table,

70
00:03:16.265 --> 00:03:19.940
and in turn, that
filters our sparklines,

71
00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.455
which we can see are changing.

72
00:03:21.455 --> 00:03:25.405
Fantastic. I'm going
to clear that filter.

73
00:03:25.405 --> 00:03:27.860
For the next one,
I'm going to need

74
00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.310
you to come to the job sheet.

75
00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.690
Here we have a pivot table

76
00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.610
which is showing us
the number of jobs

77
00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:35.630
available in

78
00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.280
different renewable energy source

79
00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.960
fields for a given year.

80
00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.530
[inaudible] has already
created the pivot chart,

81
00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.330
but he'd actually like to see
each source in the legend,

82
00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.465
which means he needs them
to show as row labels.

83
00:03:50.465 --> 00:03:53.060
We're going to select
our pivot chart,

84
00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.235
we're going to come
to the design tab,

85
00:03:55.235 --> 00:03:58.670
and we're going to
switch row column data.

86
00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.740
There's something
that's gone a bit funny

87
00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.450
with our third series here,

88
00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.075
so I'm just going to
select that third bar.

89
00:04:05.075 --> 00:04:07.060
We are going to come
up to our format,

90
00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.160
and we're going to change
the shape fill to Aqua.

91
00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.335
While we're here, let's
get rid of that border.

92
00:04:13.335 --> 00:04:14.925
I'm going to select the chart,

93
00:04:14.925 --> 00:04:18.790
and our shape outline is
going to be no outline.

94
00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.660
There's our finished chart,

95
00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.360
but instead of putting
numbers on these bars,

96
00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.580
[inaudible] would
like to represent

97
00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.910
every 200,000 jobs as a person.

98
00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.965
We're going to do this with
a really simple graphic.

99
00:04:33.965 --> 00:04:38.865
This black box shows
25 people in a row,

100
00:04:38.865 --> 00:04:41.565
and they're basically
transparent.

101
00:04:41.565 --> 00:04:45.550
When I drag this onto my chart,

102
00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.260
make it a tiny bit wider,

103
00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.295
it looks like I'm
seeing an info-graphic.

104
00:04:53.295 --> 00:04:56.810
If I were to filter it
to show 2017's data,

105
00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.115
you can see it
immediately adjusts.

106
00:05:00.115 --> 00:05:04.430
Very simple, chart and graphic
to creating info-graphic.

107
00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.435
Let's put those all
on the dashboard.

108
00:05:06.435 --> 00:05:09.680
I'm going to select once you
select my actual graphic.

109
00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.685
Hold my shift select my chart,

110
00:05:11.685 --> 00:05:13.595
and we'll grab the
key at the same time.

111
00:05:13.595 --> 00:05:15.650
I'm going to copy control C,

112
00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:17.299
come back to the dashboard

113
00:05:17.299 --> 00:05:19.210
and I'll just click on
the right over here and

114
00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:24.285
paste and then we can just
move that all into place.

115
00:05:24.285 --> 00:05:27.870
You might just need
to adjust your key.

116
00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.190
Let's go and have a look
at our last example.

117
00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:35.170
This time I need you to come
to the investment sheet.

118
00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.680
You may recall this was

119
00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.400
the Pivot table we
created to show

120
00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.530
the top five countries
where there was

121
00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:46.140
renewable investment
for a given year.

122
00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:48.255
Ron has already created

123
00:05:48.255 --> 00:05:50.910
a very stylish
looking pivot chart.

124
00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:53.400
By removing all the
extraneous noise,

125
00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.705
you can actually focus
on the key information.

126
00:05:56.705 --> 00:06:00.210
Ron would like to make
one more change, though.

127
00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:03.110
Instead of having these
squared off edges,

128
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:06.245
he would like it to look that
different and be rounded.

129
00:06:06.245 --> 00:06:08.525
Now here's a very
interesting thing.

130
00:06:08.525 --> 00:06:10.925
You can actually grab a shape,

131
00:06:10.925 --> 00:06:14.205
any shape copy control C,

132
00:06:14.205 --> 00:06:16.900
click onto one of your
columns or bars in

133
00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:20.350
your chart and paste
and it will replace it.

134
00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:22.970
The only problem is we're getting

135
00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:24.560
a much steeper curve

136
00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.325
on the bigger values.
It doesn't look great.

137
00:06:27.325 --> 00:06:28.975
I'm going to undo that

138
00:06:28.975 --> 00:06:32.885
and we're going to look at
how we can fix that problem.

139
00:06:32.885 --> 00:06:34.890
What we really need to do is

140
00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:37.849
effectively split the
bars into two sections,

141
00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:39.885
so the top is always the same.

142
00:06:39.885 --> 00:06:42.765
That way we can paste
this just onto the top.

143
00:06:42.765 --> 00:06:45.300
We're going to do
exactly that by using

144
00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:48.305
calculated fields. A
little bit more revision.

145
00:06:48.305 --> 00:06:50.400
Clicking into our pivot table,

146
00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:51.810
we're going to come
to pivot table,

147
00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:54.330
analyze, come to fields,

148
00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:56.945
items and sets and
we're going to create

149
00:06:56.945 --> 00:07:00.830
a calculated field for the
bottom part of the bar.

150
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:05.250
I'm going to call it bottom.
It's going to be equal

151
00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:09.675
to the US dollar millions,

152
00:07:09.675 --> 00:07:11.820
but minus 800,

153
00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:13.970
because that's the amount
we're going to put on top.

154
00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:17.330
I'm going to say
"Okay". Now because

155
00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:20.540
this is a stacked column
chart, it's put it on top.

156
00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:23.905
Let's add another one.
Fields, items and sets.

157
00:07:23.905 --> 00:07:25.295
Calculated field.

158
00:07:25.295 --> 00:07:27.125
This is going to be our top.

159
00:07:27.125 --> 00:07:28.670
This is even easier.

160
00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:32.400
It's going to be 800 and
I'm going to say, "Okay".

161
00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:35.650
Now it's looking a little
odd at the moment,

162
00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:37.835
but let's go and add
some data labels

163
00:07:37.835 --> 00:07:39.530
and then we'll look
at fixing it up.

164
00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:41.405
I've clicked onto a bar,

165
00:07:41.405 --> 00:07:43.375
I'm going to hit my plus and I'm

166
00:07:43.375 --> 00:07:45.630
going to turn on data labels.

167
00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:47.660
I'm going to select my labels.

168
00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:49.115
I going to make a few changes.

169
00:07:49.115 --> 00:07:51.270
I'm going to drop the
size down to eight.

170
00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:53.745
I'm going to change
the font to white,

171
00:07:53.745 --> 00:07:57.480
and I'm going to change
the fill to black.

172
00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:00.720
Then one other
thing, control one.

173
00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:05.235
Let's actually position
those at the inside end.

174
00:08:05.235 --> 00:08:07.680
Alright, now let's
go and actually

175
00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:09.645
fix up the chart itself.

176
00:08:09.645 --> 00:08:12.540
Selecting the bottom bar,

177
00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:15.525
which is our sum of
US dollar millions.

178
00:08:15.525 --> 00:08:18.320
We actually don't want to
see that in the chart.

179
00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:21.060
The temptation would be to
remove it from the pivot.

180
00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:23.250
But you actually
need that amount for

181
00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:25.770
your calculation of
sum of bottom to work.

182
00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:28.490
What we're going to do
instead is hide it.

183
00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:30.580
This is a two-step operation.

184
00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:33.525
First of all, coming to
our format data series,

185
00:08:33.525 --> 00:08:34.905
we're going to come to fill

186
00:08:34.905 --> 00:08:37.190
and we are going to
specify no fill.

187
00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:41.045
Then on our border we are
going to specify no line.

188
00:08:41.045 --> 00:08:44.030
It's hidden, but you
can still see it.

189
00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:46.455
Here's the other important step.

190
00:08:46.455 --> 00:08:48.700
We are going to come
to our design tab,

191
00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:50.745
change chart type.

192
00:08:50.745 --> 00:08:53.520
We're going to put
sum of bottom and

193
00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:56.345
sum of top on a secondary axis,

194
00:08:56.345 --> 00:09:00.510
effectively hiding our US
dollar millions behind them.

195
00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:04.485
When we say "Okay"
we're getting there.

196
00:09:04.485 --> 00:09:06.810
Let's just hide
that secondary axis

197
00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:09.470
because we don't
actually want that.

198
00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:13.635
Now just a few little
changes to color.

199
00:09:13.635 --> 00:09:15.755
I'm going to select the bottom,

200
00:09:15.755 --> 00:09:18.420
come to format change
our shape fill,

201
00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:21.090
just going for
standard green here.

202
00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:23.975
Now comes the moment we've
been looking forward to,

203
00:09:23.975 --> 00:09:27.435
I'm going to select
my shape control C,

204
00:09:27.435 --> 00:09:30.760
click on the top series
and paste control

205
00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:36.390
V. There's my
finished infographic.

206
00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:39.330
When I filter it
to see 2016 data,

207
00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:42.055
you can see it
immediately adjusts.

208
00:09:42.055 --> 00:09:44.160
Right, let's put that onto

209
00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:48.850
our dashboard so control
C back to our dashboard.

210
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.380
I'm just going to put
that into position.

211
00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:57.340
You might need to
resize slightly.

212
00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:03.205
The dashboard is coming
together very nicely,

213
00:10:03.205 --> 00:10:04.620
but at the moment we have

214
00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:07.230
no way of interacting with these.

215
00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:09.065
That's what we're going
to look at when we

216
00:10:09.065 --> 00:10:12.080
add slices to this dashboard.
