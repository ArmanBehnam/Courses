00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.220
In this video, we're
going to look at

2
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.325
planning and laying
out a dashboard.

3
00:00:11.325 --> 00:00:14.025
A lot of the hard work
has already been done,

4
00:00:14.025 --> 00:00:15.645
the data has been cleaned,

5
00:00:15.645 --> 00:00:17.355
we've created a few pivots,

6
00:00:17.355 --> 00:00:20.250
and Roman has even done a
few simple calculations,

7
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.140
to create some
additional metrics.

8
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.710
We would like to create
one further calculation,

9
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.990
so that we have a
dynamic heading that

10
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.105
always picks up the
most recent year.

11
00:00:34.105 --> 00:00:37.190
We have a max calculation
at the moment,

12
00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.175
which gets the most recent
year out of the year column.

13
00:00:40.175 --> 00:00:43.145
When we add the year 2020's data,

14
00:00:43.145 --> 00:00:45.670
this will update to 2020.

15
00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.520
To create our calculation.

16
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.330
We're going to click into
"L1" and type equals,

17
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:59.385
and we're going to call this
renewable energy dashboard,

18
00:00:59.385 --> 00:01:01.590
then type your space,

19
00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.530
close your double-quotes and

20
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.235
we're going to use an ampersand,

21
00:01:05.235 --> 00:01:09.825
to concatenate or join our year.

22
00:01:09.825 --> 00:01:13.995
I'm going to click on
"L4"and press "Enter".

23
00:01:13.995 --> 00:01:18.345
When we add our 2020
data, that will update.

24
00:01:18.345 --> 00:01:20.835
Let's go and create
that dashboard.

25
00:01:20.835 --> 00:01:24.015
We're going to click into
our ''Dashboard tab'',

26
00:01:24.015 --> 00:01:26.360
and Roman has already spent

27
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.205
some time thinking
about the design,

28
00:01:28.205 --> 00:01:30.425
and he's followed good
design principles,

29
00:01:30.425 --> 00:01:33.485
in that he has his most
important metrics at the top,

30
00:01:33.485 --> 00:01:37.750
working its way down
to support in detail.

31
00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.480
It also has a flow,

32
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.720
so it flows left to right,

33
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.000
which is the way most
of his audience read,

34
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.010
and he's made sure he's

35
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.295
grouped related
information together.

36
00:01:49.295 --> 00:01:52.190
The next thing we
need to decide is

37
00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.085
how big to make our dashboard.

38
00:01:55.085 --> 00:01:57.485
We need it to fit on one screen,

39
00:01:57.485 --> 00:01:59.330
and if it's going to print,

40
00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.370
it needs to fit on a page.

41
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.785
Roman has given us
some consideration,

42
00:02:03.785 --> 00:02:06.755
and if you come to
your page layout view,

43
00:02:06.755 --> 00:02:09.455
he's changed the
orientation to landscape,

44
00:02:09.455 --> 00:02:13.115
and as long as we go up to
column S, it should fit.

45
00:02:13.115 --> 00:02:16.130
If your page settings
are slightly different,

46
00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.265
you just need to make sure
that it fits onto your page.

47
00:02:19.265 --> 00:02:22.550
Now I'm going to come
back to my normal view,

48
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.845
and the next thing
we need to decide,

49
00:02:24.845 --> 00:02:27.850
is what color we want
our background to be.

50
00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.390
White is a really good choice,

51
00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:31.935
but if you're going
to curve white,

52
00:02:31.935 --> 00:02:35.575
come to your View tab and
turn off the grid lines.

53
00:02:35.575 --> 00:02:38.495
Roman actually want something
a bit more colorful.

54
00:02:38.495 --> 00:02:41.540
We're going to select
the entire spreadsheet,

55
00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.475
come to our Home tab,

56
00:02:43.475 --> 00:02:47.065
come to our paint bucket
and click the drop-down.

57
00:02:47.065 --> 00:02:50.510
Roman selected the
following theme colors,

58
00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.440
and we'll look more at
colors in the last video.

59
00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.320
But it is really
important that you always

60
00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.250
work with the selected
theme colors.

61
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.850
This will not only guarantee

62
00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.640
consistency across
your dashboard,

63
00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.950
but it will mean that
if you needed to change

64
00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.845
your color scheme,
it's a one-click.

65
00:03:09.845 --> 00:03:14.820
We're going to go for the
aqua, and click ''Away''.

66
00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.245
It's important in
the dashboard that

67
00:03:18.245 --> 00:03:20.390
related information and controls

68
00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.070
for managing that information,

69
00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:26.140
are grouped together, and
often we do this using tiles.

70
00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.225
To create a tile, there a few
approaches we could take,

71
00:03:29.225 --> 00:03:31.430
so one would be to select

72
00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.465
the cells and then
just change the color.

73
00:03:34.465 --> 00:03:36.610
Now the only problem
with doing that,

74
00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.750
is we will be constrained by

75
00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.020
the proportions of our column
widths and row heights,

76
00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.655
which doesn't leave
as much flexibility.

77
00:03:44.655 --> 00:03:48.620
The other problem is we have
to have square corner tiles,

78
00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.650
and we've decided we
want rounded corners.

79
00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.390
Instead of that approach,

80
00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.030
we're going to use a shape.

81
00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.870
To do this, we're going to
come to our ''Insert tab'',

82
00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.774
we're going to come to Shapes,

83
00:03:59.774 --> 00:04:03.185
we're going to choose the
rectangle with rounded corners.

84
00:04:03.185 --> 00:04:05.030
It's a click-to-select,

85
00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.970
then come to the
top corner of B2,

86
00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:12.135
click-hold and drag
to draw your tile.

87
00:04:12.135 --> 00:04:15.540
We'd like the shape
fill to be black,

88
00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.180
and we don't want an outline,

89
00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.040
so I'm just going to set those.

90
00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.925
It's also easier to work with
more precise dimensions.

91
00:04:22.925 --> 00:04:25.160
So on the right of
our shape format,

92
00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.235
we're going to set
our height to be 1.2,

93
00:04:28.235 --> 00:04:31.865
and our width to
be 21 centimeters.

94
00:04:31.865 --> 00:04:33.980
Now if you don't
have centimeters,

95
00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.200
if you type the cm,

96
00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.090
it will convert whatever unit you

97
00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.550
have to the centimeter
equivalent.

98
00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.124
If you do have centimeters,

99
00:04:42.124 --> 00:04:43.715
you don't need to type it.

100
00:04:43.715 --> 00:04:45.665
I'm just going to press "Enter".

101
00:04:45.665 --> 00:04:47.390
Now something to be aware of,

102
00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:50.450
if you were to change your
column at so low heights,

103
00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:53.000
the shape would actually
change as well.

104
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.605
We don't want that to happen.

105
00:04:54.605 --> 00:04:56.390
I'm going to press "Ctrl 1" to

106
00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:58.580
open up my format shape panel,

107
00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.325
and I'm going to come
to the properties icon,

108
00:05:01.325 --> 00:05:04.325
and if needs be expand
the property section.

109
00:05:04.325 --> 00:05:09.035
The option we need is move
but don't size with cells.

110
00:05:09.035 --> 00:05:12.645
Select that and we
can close that up.

111
00:05:12.645 --> 00:05:15.395
Now rather than going
through all of that again,

112
00:05:15.395 --> 00:05:18.020
I'm going to duplicate my tile.

113
00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.625
I'm going to hold
"Ctrl" and press "D".

114
00:05:21.625 --> 00:05:25.265
This one's also going to
be 1.2 centimeters high,

115
00:05:25.265 --> 00:05:28.775
but only 3.5 centimeters wide.

116
00:05:28.775 --> 00:05:30.965
Then I need another two of those,

117
00:05:30.965 --> 00:05:32.600
so holding my control key down,

118
00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.010
I'm going to press "D" twice.

119
00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.970
We're going to just roughly
put those into place.

120
00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:40.540
We're not going to spend a lot of

121
00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:42.910
time getting them exactly right,

122
00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:44.350
because we're going to
use the Excel tools

123
00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:46.580
for that very shortly.

124
00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:51.450
Now let's create our main tile

125
00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:53.595
to hold our renewable capacity.

126
00:05:53.595 --> 00:05:56.444
I'm going to Control
D to duplicate,

127
00:05:56.444 --> 00:05:57.825
move that down leaving

128
00:05:57.825 --> 00:06:00.360
a nice little gap and
this one is going to be

129
00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:05.490
eight centimeters high
by 32 centimeters wide.

130
00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:06.870
Then we'll just do one last

131
00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:12.915
one Control D and

132
00:06:12.915 --> 00:06:14.520
our next tile is going to be

133
00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:18.495
seven centimeters high
by 15 centimeters wide.

134
00:06:18.495 --> 00:06:20.850
This is going to go
in the last row.

135
00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:23.010
There are two additional
tiles we need,

136
00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:25.545
but we're not going to
worry to create them now.

137
00:06:25.545 --> 00:06:27.900
It is quite important

138
00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:29.430
if you're using
shapes that you make

139
00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:32.685
sure that they line up nicely
and are evenly spaced,

140
00:06:32.685 --> 00:06:34.545
that's what we're
going to do next.

141
00:06:34.545 --> 00:06:37.440
I'm going to select
my three tiles on

142
00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:41.940
the left and then coming up
to my Shape Format ribbon,

143
00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:44.385
I'm going to find the align tools

144
00:06:44.385 --> 00:06:45.780
and I'm going to align them

145
00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.700
left and you'll see they all

146
00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:50.730
align left with the
leftmost shape.

147
00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:52.710
So before you press the align,

148
00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:55.290
make sure that the shapes are

149
00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:57.450
right of the leftmost shape

150
00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:58.815
that you want to align them to.

151
00:06:58.815 --> 00:07:01.395
The same is going to
be true on the right.

152
00:07:01.395 --> 00:07:04.020
With this loose shape, I'm
going to actually move it in,

153
00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:05.970
make sure it's below
the top and to

154
00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:08.280
the left of my main
shape and then I'm

155
00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:09.840
going to hold my Shift to select

156
00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:13.335
my main tile and I'm going
to align those right.

157
00:07:13.335 --> 00:07:15.555
Now let's do our top row.

158
00:07:15.555 --> 00:07:18.900
I'm going to select the
four tiles in the top row.

159
00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:21.480
I'm going to click "Align Top",

160
00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:26.200
and then I'm going to choose
Distribute horizontally.

161
00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:30.600
It's still not looking
perfect because you probably

162
00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:33.255
noticed that when you
create a larger rectangle,

163
00:07:33.255 --> 00:07:36.630
it actually gives it a
much more rounded corner.

164
00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:38.550
To adjust the rounding.

165
00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:39.810
If you select the shape,

166
00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:41.835
you get a yellow circle

167
00:07:41.835 --> 00:07:44.820
and if you try that
towards the corner,

168
00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:46.230
it gets smaller and if you drag

169
00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:48.030
it away, it gets more rounded.

170
00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:51.240
The problem is to do that
manually will be quite time

171
00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:55.380
consuming and we're unlikely
to get them all the same.

172
00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:59.100
The good news is, we
know how to use a macro,

173
00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:00.840
and we've actually
created a macro

174
00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:02.445
for you that will change

175
00:08:02.445 --> 00:08:05.865
all the rounded rectangle
corners to the same dimensions.

176
00:08:05.865 --> 00:08:07.380
So little bit of revision,

177
00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:09.525
we're going to come
to our Developer tab.

178
00:08:09.525 --> 00:08:11.670
We're going to come to Macros

179
00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:13.860
and there's our
set corners macro,

180
00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:16.410
we're going to click "Run" and

181
00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:19.035
that's now looking pretty neat.

182
00:08:19.035 --> 00:08:23.580
Let's go and add some
metrics to our tiles.

183
00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:25.185
We'll start with our heading.

184
00:08:25.185 --> 00:08:27.765
I'm going to click on my
first tile and we're going to

185
00:08:27.765 --> 00:08:31.140
link it to the data in our
renewable energy sheet.

186
00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:35.310
We're going to click into our
formula bar type "Equals",

187
00:08:35.310 --> 00:08:37.125
click on Renewable energy,

188
00:08:37.125 --> 00:08:40.935
and then click into
L4 and press "Enter".

189
00:08:40.935 --> 00:08:42.780
We're going to do very much

190
00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:44.730
the same thing for
our mini metrics,

191
00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:47.160
but we just need to
change the alignment,

192
00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:48.990
can you please,
using a shift key,

193
00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:51.840
select the three
small tiles come to

194
00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:54.045
your Home tab and we're
going to make them

195
00:08:54.045 --> 00:08:57.270
align bottom and center.

196
00:08:57.270 --> 00:09:00.600
We're going to click on
our first millimetric tile

197
00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.640
and we're going to do what
we did for our heading.

198
00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:06.165
We're going to click into
our formula bar type equals,

199
00:09:06.165 --> 00:09:08.640
come to renewable
energy and click

200
00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:11.460
on our percentage increase
and press "Enter".

201
00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:14.115
You'll see not only did it
pulled through the value,

202
00:09:14.115 --> 00:09:16.290
it pulled through the
formatting as well.

203
00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:18.870
We've got our custom
number format then we

204
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:21.585
couldn't have done that with
conditional formatting.

205
00:09:21.585 --> 00:09:24.165
Lets have a quick way of
doing that for the others,

206
00:09:24.165 --> 00:09:25.860
we can actually copy the formula.

207
00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:29.550
I'm going to press Control
C, click onto my next tile,

208
00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:31.200
click in my formula bar and

209
00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.330
paste and then all I
need to do is change

210
00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:38.370
the M to an N. We'll do that
the same for our last tile,

211
00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:40.290
clicking your formula bar, paste,

212
00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:43.620
Control V, and change M to an O.

213
00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:45.930
Looking good. But obviously we

214
00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:47.520
need some contexts
for these tiles,

215
00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:49.365
so we are going to
need to label them.

216
00:09:49.365 --> 00:09:51.150
One of the easiest ways of doing

217
00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:53.430
that is using a text box.

218
00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:55.680
I'm going to come back
to my Insert tab,

219
00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:58.320
come to shapes and in
your basic shapes,

220
00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:00.795
the first option is a text box.

221
00:10:00.795 --> 00:10:02.580
I'm going to click just to

222
00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:05.500
the right my tiles so you
can see what I'm doing.

223
00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:09.010
I'm going to do the solar,

224
00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:12.450
label so I'm going to type solar.

225
00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:14.400
I'm going to click on the edge of

226
00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:16.710
the text box and we're
going to change the size to

227
00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:22.875
nine and the color,
bright yellow.

228
00:10:22.875 --> 00:10:24.270
This is going to be able to theme

229
00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:25.650
whenever we talk about solar,

230
00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:27.570
We're going to try
make it yellow.

231
00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:32.650
We're then going to drag our
label onto our solar panel,

232
00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:37.890
and picture worth
says 1000 words.

233
00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:40.290
Let's go and add an icon as well.

234
00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:43.455
On our Insert tab, we're
going to come to icons.

235
00:10:43.455 --> 00:10:45.420
We're going to type sun,

236
00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:47.070
if you don't have icons,

237
00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:49.395
these actually have been
included in your workbook,

238
00:10:49.395 --> 00:10:51.045
so you can just
grab one of those.

239
00:10:51.045 --> 00:10:53.205
But if you do, do this with me,

240
00:10:53.205 --> 00:10:54.660
grab anyone you like look

241
00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:57.105
off and I'm going
to click "Insert".

242
00:10:57.105 --> 00:10:59.940
I'd like this to be
a bright yellow as

243
00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:04.500
well and I'm going to change
the dimensions to be 0.8.

244
00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:07.140
I can drag that and drop

245
00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:10.180
that in the top left-hand corner.

246
00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:12.875
I'm going to leave the hydro

247
00:11:12.875 --> 00:11:15.410
and the wind energy
for you to do.

248
00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:19.385
We should also label our
tiles and for speed sake,

249
00:11:19.385 --> 00:11:20.480
I've already created a

250
00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:22.310
few and I'm just going
to drag them in.

251
00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:24.215
You're welcome to do the same.

252
00:11:24.215 --> 00:11:26.285
But I'd actually encourage you to

253
00:11:26.285 --> 00:11:29.620
create your own and have a
little bit of fun with it.

254
00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:32.505
A few things you need to
finish off on the dashboard,

255
00:11:32.505 --> 00:11:34.110
two missing tiles and a couple of

256
00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:36.300
labels and I'll see
you in the next video,

257
00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:38.800
where going to add some charts.
