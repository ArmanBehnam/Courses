00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:07.770
In this video, we're
going to look at

2
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.780
how we can add further
visual interest

3
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.850
using some of the
graphical tools like

4
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.315
sparklines, pictures, and shapes.

5
00:00:15.315 --> 00:00:19.140
Roan would like to
illustrate the trends in

6
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.695
coal waste production and
recovery rates for each state,

7
00:00:22.695 --> 00:00:26.640
but he doesn't want to
have to create 16 charts.

8
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.015
One alternative is
to use sparkline.

9
00:00:30.015 --> 00:00:31.740
A sparkline is really

10
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.410
a miniature chart that
sits inside one cell.

11
00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.220
To create a sparkline,

12
00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.990
you can either select the data or

13
00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.255
the cell where you want
the sparkline to go.

14
00:00:41.255 --> 00:00:44.280
We're going to start
by clicking in K5,

15
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.955
and then we're going to
come to our Insert ribbon

16
00:00:46.955 --> 00:00:48.740
and in the Sparklines group,

17
00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.420
you'll see there are
three to choose from.

18
00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.410
We're going to choose
a Column sparkline.

19
00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.030
It's identified our
location range,

20
00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.460
but we now need to
give it a data range,

21
00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.190
so we're going to select from C5

22
00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.495
across to H5 and then
just press "Okay."

23
00:01:05.495 --> 00:01:08.450
There's our sparkline.
The great thing about

24
00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.945
sparklines is you can use the
Fill handle to copy them.

25
00:01:11.945 --> 00:01:13.730
If I come to my Fill handle,

26
00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:15.425
that bottom right-hand corner,

27
00:01:15.425 --> 00:01:19.055
and drag down, I

28
00:01:19.055 --> 00:01:21.665
can now see the trends
for each of my states.

29
00:01:21.665 --> 00:01:24.305
When you copy a
sparkline that way,

30
00:01:24.305 --> 00:01:27.385
they are automatically
linked or grouped.

31
00:01:27.385 --> 00:01:30.740
You can ungroup all of them
or an individual one by

32
00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.390
coming up to the Sparkline ribbon

33
00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.100
and clicking on "Group."

34
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.150
But we're going to leave them

35
00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.130
grouped because if you do that,

36
00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.590
changing one will
change all of them.

37
00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.260
So I'm just going to
select a single sparkline

38
00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.465
and we'll look at some
of the mods we can make.

39
00:01:44.465 --> 00:01:46.895
First of all, there's
some style options,

40
00:01:46.895 --> 00:01:49.690
so I could go for a
different shade of blue.

41
00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.060
You could come to Sparkline Color

42
00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.455
and be a bit more
specific as well.

43
00:01:54.455 --> 00:01:57.020
You can change the marker color.

44
00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.900
These are particular points
within the sparkline.

45
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.475
For example, the high point,

46
00:02:01.475 --> 00:02:03.750
I'm going to make
that a dark red.

47
00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.755
You can also
copy-paste sparklines,

48
00:02:07.755 --> 00:02:09.510
so I'm going to select
the whole group,

49
00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:11.385
Control C to copy,

50
00:02:11.385 --> 00:02:13.730
click next to my
resource recovery rates,

51
00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.905
and Control V to paste.

52
00:02:15.905 --> 00:02:19.040
These ones, however, while
linked to each other,

53
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.500
are not linked to the first set.

54
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.390
Clicking into my second group,

55
00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.160
I'm going to make
some changes as well.

56
00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.990
I'm going to come to Sparkline,

57
00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.120
and I'd like these
to be line graphs

58
00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.965
rather than column charts.

59
00:02:30.965 --> 00:02:32.630
On the left-hand side,

60
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.440
you can change your sparkline
type and of course,

61
00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.345
you can change the
color here as well.

62
00:02:38.345 --> 00:02:39.890
I'm going to come to my Styles,

63
00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.870
go for a green one this time,

64
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.310
and change my high point to
be a nice bright yellow.

65
00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.860
So very easy to
create and to modify.

66
00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.600
If you needed to update

67
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.000
the data that the
sparkline was looking at,

68
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.230
you could come to Edit Data.

69
00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.455
If you need to remove sparklines,

70
00:02:57.455 --> 00:02:59.420
just select the ones
you want to remove

71
00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.710
and click the Clear button
on your Sparkline ribbon.

72
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.075
That was the first thing
we wanted to look at.

73
00:03:06.075 --> 00:03:09.590
Now, the other thing Roan
would like to do is when he

74
00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.010
changes territory or
state in the map,

75
00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.190
he would like to get a
summary of the recovery,

76
00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.585
recycling, and
landfill percentages.

77
00:03:19.585 --> 00:03:21.510
Now, we could obviously just

78
00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.760
put a little formula under here.

79
00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.220
The only difficulty with that

80
00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.960
is it's going to be very hard

81
00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.180
to position the data

82
00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.275
nicely because we have to now
start widening our columns.

83
00:03:32.275 --> 00:03:34.220
What Roan would like to do is

84
00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.335
actually have those
values sitting

85
00:03:36.335 --> 00:03:38.120
in a graphical way
that he can just

86
00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.985
drag and drop them and make
them any size he likes.

87
00:03:40.985 --> 00:03:45.910
You can achieve this by
linking a value to a shape.

88
00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:47.750
The first thing we, of
course, are going to

89
00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.010
have to do is have

90
00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.065
a calculation to return

91
00:03:51.065 --> 00:03:54.170
the correct values for
the selected state.

92
00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.140
So a little bit of
revision on our VLOOKUP.

93
00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.560
We're going to
click into N1 first

94
00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.960
and we're going to type
equals VL for VLOOKUP.

95
00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.730
The value we're looking
up as our selected state,

96
00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.490
so I'm going to click
on K1 and comma.

97
00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:12.290
Now I'm going to select

98
00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.110
all my data in the
bottom section,

99
00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:20.565
so from B29 E36.

100
00:04:20.565 --> 00:04:24.260
Then another comma.
My recovery data,

101
00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:25.340
which is the first thing I want,

102
00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.430
is in column 2, so that's
a two and a comma.

103
00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.450
Finally, this is
definitely an exact match,

104
00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:34.975
so I either need to
type false or zero.

105
00:04:34.975 --> 00:04:37.100
I'm going to close my
bracket and I'm actually

106
00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.810
going to copy that whole thing.

107
00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.645
I'm going to copy everything
after the equals Control C,

108
00:04:41.645 --> 00:04:45.445
just to save me some time,
and now I'm going to tap.

109
00:04:45.445 --> 00:04:48.320
Now, the second thing I want
to do is get my recycling,

110
00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.600
so I'm going to type
equals and paste.

111
00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.180
Then I just need to
edit the column to be

112
00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:56.165
column 3 and tap.

113
00:04:56.165 --> 00:05:00.020
Then the same thing,
equals, Control V,

114
00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:04.420
and let's change that to
column 4, and "Enter."

115
00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:07.405
There are my three rates
for Northern territories.

116
00:05:07.405 --> 00:05:08.860
They look better as percentages.

117
00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.540
I'm going to highlight that
and make it a percentage.

118
00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:14.625
If I come and change this to ACT,

119
00:05:14.625 --> 00:05:17.065
they're my percentages for ACT.

120
00:05:17.065 --> 00:05:19.190
That's all working really nicely,

121
00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:20.980
but I actually want
to see those values

122
00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:25.005
appearing in more graphical
way underneath my map.

123
00:05:25.005 --> 00:05:27.780
What we're going to
do is use a shape.

124
00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.830
Shapes are extremely useful,

125
00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.060
we can use them as buttons,

126
00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:32.545
we've seen that with our macros,

127
00:05:32.545 --> 00:05:35.855
and we can use them to
display values in dashboards,

128
00:05:35.855 --> 00:05:39.505
or we can use them to display
values in our workbook.

129
00:05:39.505 --> 00:05:42.530
We're going to come to
our Insert ribbon again,

130
00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:44.120
and in the Illustrations group,

131
00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:45.770
we're going to look for Shapes.

132
00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:47.845
There are a lot to choose from.

133
00:05:47.845 --> 00:05:50.560
The one I'm going to use
is in the flowchart group,

134
00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:51.815
it's called the Terminator.

135
00:05:51.815 --> 00:05:53.920
You can use any one
you like, though.

136
00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.410
I'm going to click
once and release,

137
00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:57.850
and then I'm going to move my

138
00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:59.530
cross head, that little cross,

139
00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:01.855
to the position where
I want my shape to go,

140
00:06:01.855 --> 00:06:03.600
and I'm going to click, hold,

141
00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.350
and drag to draw the shape.

142
00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.995
Once you've drawn the shape,

143
00:06:08.995 --> 00:06:11.365
you can make some changes to it.

144
00:06:11.365 --> 00:06:14.680
You'll see a shape format
ribbon has appeared,

145
00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.475
and on the right-hand side,

146
00:06:16.475 --> 00:06:18.155
you can change the size.

147
00:06:18.155 --> 00:06:20.900
I would like mine
to be exactly one,

148
00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:22.660
and then I'm just
going to press tab

149
00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:26.090
and three centimeters.

150
00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:31.265
You can also, of course,
change your colors.

151
00:06:31.265 --> 00:06:32.710
You've got a gallery of shapes,

152
00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:34.120
styles you can choose from,

153
00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.845
or you can be more specific.

154
00:06:35.845 --> 00:06:37.210
I'm going to come to my shape

155
00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:39.430
fill and I'm going
to make it black.

156
00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:41.050
I'm going to change my outline

157
00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:43.190
to white, it's a bit simple.

158
00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:45.390
Then one last thing
with the Shape,

159
00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:47.435
we're going to come
to Home and I'm going

160
00:06:47.435 --> 00:06:50.015
to center align the text.

161
00:06:50.015 --> 00:06:52.940
Now, I'm not going to type
anything in there yet.

162
00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:55.345
I actually need three shapes,

163
00:06:55.345 --> 00:06:57.470
and rather than going
through all of that again,

164
00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:59.785
I'm going to
duplicate this shape.

165
00:06:59.785 --> 00:07:01.395
You could copy paste,

166
00:07:01.395 --> 00:07:04.045
but the duplicate is a really
quick way of doing that.

167
00:07:04.045 --> 00:07:08.530
I'm going to hold control
down and press D twice,

168
00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:12.225
and that's your keyboard
shortcut to duplicate.

169
00:07:12.225 --> 00:07:14.410
Then I'm going to
grab my third shape

170
00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:15.995
and move it roughly into

171
00:07:15.995 --> 00:07:17.375
the position where I want it to

172
00:07:17.375 --> 00:07:19.850
be. So we put it up there.

173
00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:21.700
We don't want to spend a lot of

174
00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:23.365
time lining our shapes up,

175
00:07:23.365 --> 00:07:25.090
but it is important
that they properly

176
00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:27.175
aligned for that good finish.

177
00:07:27.175 --> 00:07:30.295
Here's some great tools
to speed the process up.

178
00:07:30.295 --> 00:07:31.925
We're going to use
our shift key to

179
00:07:31.925 --> 00:07:34.040
select all three shapes.

180
00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:36.880
I'm going to come up to
my shape format ribbon,

181
00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:40.015
and I'm going to find the
align tool on the right,

182
00:07:40.015 --> 00:07:41.410
and I'm going to start by

183
00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:43.570
aligning them all to the bottom.

184
00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:45.305
That means they're all aligned

185
00:07:45.305 --> 00:07:47.840
to the shape that's
at the lowest point.

186
00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:50.185
Then I'm going to
come back to align,

187
00:07:50.185 --> 00:07:55.840
and I'm going to distribute
horizontally really quick.

188
00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:59.410
Now, that's done, let's
go and link shapes to

189
00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:02.335
the percentages in our top row.

190
00:08:02.335 --> 00:08:04.460
I'm going to click
on the first shape,

191
00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:06.995
and I'm going to click
into my formula bar,

192
00:08:06.995 --> 00:08:08.585
and this is a really neat trick.

193
00:08:08.585 --> 00:08:11.435
I'm going to type
equals and click

194
00:08:11.435 --> 00:08:14.650
on the cell that has the
value I want to link to.

195
00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:17.620
You can't put a whole formula
in here but obviously,

196
00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:19.380
you can put a complex
formula in the cell you're

197
00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:22.495
linking to, and then
just press enter.

198
00:08:22.495 --> 00:08:26.540
Then let's repeat that process
for the other two shapes.

199
00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:36.920
Now, I don't need to see
these values anymore,

200
00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:38.245
I don't need to see any of these,

201
00:08:38.245 --> 00:08:39.965
so I'm going to select that row

202
00:08:39.965 --> 00:08:42.170
and change my text to black.

203
00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:43.955
You don't have to hide the row,

204
00:08:43.955 --> 00:08:46.235
you just want it to
visually disappear,

205
00:08:46.235 --> 00:08:49.565
you can just make the text
same color as the background.

206
00:08:49.565 --> 00:08:51.910
Most thing I need to
do now is actually

207
00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:54.340
label these shapes
because otherwise,

208
00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:56.590
I don't know what these
values are telling me,

209
00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:58.210
and you could use a text label,

210
00:08:58.210 --> 00:08:59.515
you could use another shape.

211
00:08:59.515 --> 00:09:02.600
But another option
is to use a picture.

212
00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:05.345
The saying is a picture
says a thousand words.

213
00:09:05.345 --> 00:09:07.660
Let's go back to our Insert tab,

214
00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:09.460
come to Pictures, and

215
00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:11.270
we're going to get
them from this device.

216
00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:13.415
When you downloaded
the workbooks,

217
00:09:13.415 --> 00:09:16.445
it should also have
downloaded three images.

218
00:09:16.445 --> 00:09:19.555
Please navigate to the folder
where your workbooks are,

219
00:09:19.555 --> 00:09:23.090
and we're going to select all
three using our shift key,

220
00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:25.935
and then I'm going
to click "Insert".

221
00:09:25.935 --> 00:09:28.475
Now, they are a little
bit large so I'm

222
00:09:28.475 --> 00:09:29.740
just going to move them
so they're slightly

223
00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:31.135
more on to the screen,

224
00:09:31.135 --> 00:09:34.125
and then I'm going to come
up to picture format,

225
00:09:34.125 --> 00:09:38.405
and I'm going to come into
height and just type 1.2,

226
00:09:38.405 --> 00:09:43.580
and press "Enter" to
resize them all at once.

227
00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:45.145
Then I'm just going
to move them down.

228
00:09:45.145 --> 00:09:48.145
Now, click away for a
moment to unselect them,

229
00:09:48.145 --> 00:09:49.640
and we can just go and put

230
00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:53.005
each one next to its
relevant figures.

231
00:09:53.005 --> 00:09:57.014
The Recovery is the first
one, then Recycling,

232
00:09:57.014 --> 00:09:59.275
and then Landfill, then

233
00:09:59.275 --> 00:10:02.810
maybe we'll just select all
three and again align them.

234
00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:06.250
I'm going to say
Align Top this time.

235
00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:11.325
What we've done here is we've
used sparklines, shapes,

236
00:10:11.325 --> 00:10:13.180
and images to add that bit of

237
00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:15.970
graphical interests
to our worksheets.

238
00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:18.660
We look forward to
hearing your ideas on how

239
00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:21.120
we can add visual interest
to our worksheets.

240
00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.320
Don't forget to go and add

241
00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:25.740
your ideas to this
week's Creative Corner.
