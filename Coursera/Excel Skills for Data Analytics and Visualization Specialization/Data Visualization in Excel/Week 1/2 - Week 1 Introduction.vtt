00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.388
Welcome to data visualization.

2
00:00:05.388 --> 00:00:10.256
I'm Prishan, one of your instructors and
to introduce this week's topic

3
00:00:10.256 --> 00:00:14.132
with me here is our other instructor,
Nikki, hi, Nikki.

4
00:00:14.132 --> 00:00:17.920
>> Hi, Prishan, so
excited about this course.

5
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.788
>> The next few weeks are going
to be all about how we make data

6
00:00:21.788 --> 00:00:24.377
come to life through visualization.

7
00:00:24.377 --> 00:00:29.350
Nikki, what are your top tips for
an effective visualization?

8
00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.577
Well, visualizations must present
data in an attractive way, but

9
00:00:33.577 --> 00:00:38.783
they must also be easy to understand, put
the data into context, and tell a story.

10
00:00:38.783 --> 00:00:42.732
We need them to educate,
reveal trends, and where possible,

11
00:00:42.732 --> 00:00:44.975
be interactive and even animated.

12
00:00:44.975 --> 00:00:49.902
>> And we're going to look at different
ways of achieving all these outcomes.

13
00:00:49.902 --> 00:00:55.038
Now when we think of visualizations in
Excel, we immediately think of charts,

14
00:00:55.038 --> 00:00:58.105
but these aren't our only options,
are they?

15
00:00:58.105 --> 00:01:01.870
>> No, we actually have a lot of
other options which can work with or

16
00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.350
even instead of charts.

17
00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.381
This week,
we're not going to look at charts at all.

18
00:01:06.381 --> 00:01:10.520
In fact, we're going to start by focusing
on a great visualization tool called

19
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.540
conditional formatting.

20
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.061
>> I understand conditional formatting
is where we change the formatting, say,

21
00:01:17.061 --> 00:01:20.651
color of a cell or cells where
it meets a particular condition.

22
00:01:20.651 --> 00:01:24.930
Can you give us some examples of why
we would use conditional formatting?

23
00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.680
>> Well,
it can be used to show trends in our data.

24
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.592
We can identify anomalies like
duplicates or values that fall below or

25
00:01:32.592 --> 00:01:34.193
above a certain threshold.

26
00:01:34.193 --> 00:01:37.936
It can also be used interactively for
users to explore the data and

27
00:01:37.936 --> 00:01:41.067
highlight values that meet
their specific criteria.

28
00:01:41.067 --> 00:01:42.632
>> All sounding very useful.

29
00:01:42.632 --> 00:01:46.375
Please tell me more about how we
can achieve this interactivity.

30
00:01:46.375 --> 00:01:49.641
>> Well, there are a few
techniques we're going to explore.

31
00:01:49.641 --> 00:01:54.477
We'll start with looking at how we create
our own custom conditional formats using

32
00:01:54.477 --> 00:01:59.036
formulas, and then we're going to combine
that functionality with the use of

33
00:01:59.036 --> 00:02:00.848
drop-down lists and macros.

34
00:02:00.848 --> 00:02:05.038
>> Now, drop-down lists were covered
in the last course, but macros,

35
00:02:05.038 --> 00:02:07.248
that's new, and quite a big topic.

36
00:02:07.248 --> 00:02:11.925
>> Yes, if you want to start writing
code from scratch, it's a huge topic,

37
00:02:11.925 --> 00:02:15.622
but we're going to use Excel's
built in macro recorder to

38
00:02:15.622 --> 00:02:17.747
record us doing simple actions.

39
00:02:17.747 --> 00:02:20.080
It will generate the code for us, and

40
00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.560
then we can just run the macro
to replay those actions.

41
00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.645
>> Will we get the opportunity
to look at the code?

42
00:02:26.645 --> 00:02:31.061
>> Absolutely, we'll take a quick sneak
peek, and we'll even look at making

43
00:02:31.061 --> 00:02:35.208
simple changes to the code and
duplicating it for similar procedures.

44
00:02:35.208 --> 00:02:38.291
>> Well,
that's definitely going to be a highlight.

45
00:02:38.291 --> 00:02:40.282
So really, no charts this week?

46
00:02:40.282 --> 00:02:44.584
>> Well, not in the strict sense, but
we are going to look at sparklines,

47
00:02:44.584 --> 00:02:48.027
which are miniature charts
that sit in a single cell, and

48
00:02:48.027 --> 00:02:52.116
they allow us to quickly generate
multiple trend visualizations,

49
00:02:52.116 --> 00:02:54.867
will also be including pictures and
shapes.

50
00:02:54.867 --> 00:02:57.472
>> Are there a lot of uses for
shapes in Excel?

51
00:02:57.472 --> 00:03:02.460
>> Actually, there are loads, shapes very
useful for labels, for framing data.

52
00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:07.181
We're going to use them as macro buttons,
and they can even be linked to a cell, so

53
00:03:07.181 --> 00:03:09.800
the value in that cell
appears in the shape.

54
00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:15.196
>> The last topic we're going to cover
is quite unusual in this context,

55
00:03:15.196 --> 00:03:16.732
custom number formats.

56
00:03:16.732 --> 00:03:20.090
Can you please explain what these are?

57
00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.907
>> Well Excel allows us to specify
how we want our numbers to look.

58
00:03:23.907 --> 00:03:28.741
It provides us with built-in number
formats, like currency and percentage, but

59
00:03:28.741 --> 00:03:31.986
if we want something other
than the built-in options,

60
00:03:31.986 --> 00:03:34.623
we can create our own
custom number formats.

61
00:03:34.623 --> 00:03:38.586
This might be something as simple
as wanting all the zeros to appear

62
00:03:38.586 --> 00:03:42.430
as blank cells, or maybe even have
your dates show as just year.

63
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.466
But we can get quite creative and
include colors and symbols, and it's

64
00:03:46.466 --> 00:03:50.985
a little bit like conditional formatting,
but actually, with more options.

65
00:03:50.985 --> 00:03:54.002
>> I think that's going to be
new to quite a lot of people.

66
00:03:54.002 --> 00:03:56.711
Now, there's a lot of
content we'll be covering.

67
00:03:56.711 --> 00:04:00.605
Any tips for our learners on how to
retain all of this new knowledge?

68
00:04:00.605 --> 00:04:04.786
>> Absolutely, so to support our learners,
we've included a quick reference

69
00:04:04.786 --> 00:04:08.852
guide in the toolbox summarizing all
the topics we've covered this week.

70
00:04:08.852 --> 00:04:11.798
But really,
the best way to remember is to practice.

71
00:04:11.798 --> 00:04:15.877
So don't just watch the videos,
download the workbook and work along, and

72
00:04:15.877 --> 00:04:18.872
then try and apply these skills
to your own context, and

73
00:04:18.872 --> 00:04:21.740
it can be work or study or personal.

74
00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:26.315
We're also really excited to see how
these skills are being applied, so

75
00:04:26.315 --> 00:04:30.440
we've included a discussion forum
called creative corner, and

76
00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.716
we're encouraging students to post
their visualizations there so

77
00:04:34.716 --> 00:04:38.034
that they can inspire and
be inspired by each other.

78
00:04:38.034 --> 00:04:39.397
>> Time to get stuck in.

79
00:04:39.397 --> 00:04:44.162
We have five great videos this week
covering conditional formatting, macros,

80
00:04:44.162 --> 00:04:48.871
sparklines, working with shapes and
images, and custom number formatting.

81
00:04:48.871 --> 00:04:53.467
To get the most out of your learning,
make sure you download the workbooks and

82
00:04:53.467 --> 00:04:55.174
work alongside the videos.

83
00:04:55.174 --> 00:04:59.671
After each video, there's a practice quiz
where you can test your knowledge, and

84
00:04:59.671 --> 00:05:03.398
at the end of the week, there's
an excellent practice challenge for

85
00:05:03.398 --> 00:05:05.857
you to apply all
the skills you've learned.
