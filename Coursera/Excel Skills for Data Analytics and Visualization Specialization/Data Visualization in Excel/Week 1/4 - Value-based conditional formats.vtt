00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.655
In this video, we're going
to look at how we can use

2
00:00:08.655 --> 00:00:10.890
value-based conditional
formatting to

3
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:14.250
highlight specific criteria
in our worksheets.

4
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.655
For example, Rowan
would like to identify

5
00:00:17.655 --> 00:00:21.450
the five lowest incidence
of coal waste production.

6
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:23.760
We're going to select the data,

7
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.160
come to Conditional Formatting

8
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.455
and come to Top/Bottom Rules.

9
00:00:28.455 --> 00:00:30.725
These basically
allow us to select

10
00:00:30.725 --> 00:00:33.785
a top or bottom band
within our data.

11
00:00:33.785 --> 00:00:36.710
We want the bottom 10 items,

12
00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.090
but we're not locked into 10.

13
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.205
We're going to actually
make that five.

14
00:00:41.205 --> 00:00:44.790
By default, it shows as red
fill with dark red text,

15
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.090
but there are other presets
you can choose from.

16
00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:48.575
If you don't like any of them,

17
00:00:48.575 --> 00:00:51.460
you can come to Custom
Format and define your own.

18
00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.500
We're just going to go through
a green fill and say "OK".

19
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.840
Very easy to apply.

20
00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.420
If our data changes,

21
00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:00.905
if I make the zero,

22
00:01:00.905 --> 00:01:02.900
you'll see the
conditional formatting

23
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.735
immediately responds,

24
00:01:04.735 --> 00:01:06.410
going to undo that change,

25
00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.915
Ctrl Z and we're back.

26
00:01:08.915 --> 00:01:12.050
Now one problem that can creep
into our data that can be

27
00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.930
a real issue is duplicate values.

28
00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.820
Conditional formatting can help

29
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.640
us identify any duplicates.

30
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.140
For example, I'm going to

31
00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.920
select my states or territories.

32
00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.639
I'm going to come to
Conditional Formatting,

33
00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:28.695
come to Highlight Cell Rules,

34
00:01:28.695 --> 00:01:32.120
and here you see you get a
really rich set of options.

35
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.175
We're going to click on duplicate
values near the bottom.

36
00:01:36.175 --> 00:01:39.780
Oh dear, we do have duplicates.

37
00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.270
That could've been
really embarrassing.

38
00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.250
I'm going to select from

39
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.150
B10 all the way to J10
because that's my duplicate,

40
00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.020
and I'm just going to
press delete. Easy fix.

41
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.000
Now let's look at something
even more specific.

42
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.500
I'm going to scroll down.

43
00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.225
Rowan wants to identify

44
00:01:59.225 --> 00:02:03.335
all the recycling rates
that are below 48 percent.

45
00:02:03.335 --> 00:02:06.220
With selecting our
recycling data,

46
00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.520
come to Conditional Formatting,

47
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.290
come to Highlight Cell Rules.

48
00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:12.015
We're going to choose Less Than,

49
00:02:12.015 --> 00:02:17.040
and type 48 percent and
click "Enter" to apply.

50
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.190
We have quite a lot of
options and they're

51
00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.590
very quick and easy to apply.

52
00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.470
There is one potential downside

53
00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.455
with the one we've just used.

54
00:02:26.455 --> 00:02:29.000
If Rowan decided he want to see

55
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.835
all the recycling rates
below 50 percent,

56
00:02:31.835 --> 00:02:33.275
he would need to go and

57
00:02:33.275 --> 00:02:35.555
change the conditional
formatting.

58
00:02:35.555 --> 00:02:37.190
Now in this particular case,

59
00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.740
he's absolutely certain it
will always be 48 percent.

60
00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.210
So it's not a concern.

61
00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.220
But sometimes, we want

62
00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.500
the conditional
formatting rule to be

63
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.670
based on a value that's
in our worksheet.

64
00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.320
This, first of all,
documents [inaudible] but

65
00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.255
also makes it far
more interactive.

66
00:02:55.255 --> 00:02:59.070
Here's an interesting example.

67
00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.740
Rowan has included a map in

68
00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.210
the data and a drop-down list

69
00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:08.450
showing all the states
and territories.

70
00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.985
You may recall from
the previous calls,

71
00:03:10.985 --> 00:03:14.590
we can create a drop-down
list using data validation.

72
00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.090
If he selects a different state,

73
00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.370
he wants the cells behind

74
00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.475
the map to highlight
in a different color.

75
00:03:22.475 --> 00:03:24.020
You'll see we've now

76
00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.845
highlighted the northern
territory's region.

77
00:03:26.845 --> 00:03:30.755
He wants to do this using
conditional formatting.

78
00:03:30.755 --> 00:03:32.930
Let's start by moving
our map out of

79
00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.725
the way so we can actually
see the cells behind.

80
00:03:35.725 --> 00:03:38.745
We've actually labeled
each of the cells.

81
00:03:38.745 --> 00:03:40.730
What our conditional
formatting needs to

82
00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.860
do is to check if

83
00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:44.840
the label above the
cell we want to

84
00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.480
highlight is equal
to the selection,

85
00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.360
then we're going to
change the color.

86
00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.570
But for this, we're actually
going to need a formula.

87
00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:56.645
Make sure you've
got O11 selected.

88
00:03:56.645 --> 00:03:59.180
Come up to Conditional
Formatting.

89
00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.990
We're going to come
down to New Rule.

90
00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:04.400
The New Rule dialog gives us

91
00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.020
complete creative control

92
00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:07.850
over our conditional formatting.

93
00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:10.370
So we could define our
own two-color scale,

94
00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.520
we could define our own data bar.

95
00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.600
But what we're most interested in

96
00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.685
here is using a formula.

97
00:04:16.685 --> 00:04:18.755
We're going to click
"Use a formula",

98
00:04:18.755 --> 00:04:22.705
and then we're going to
click into the formula Bar.

99
00:04:22.705 --> 00:04:25.130
Now all formulas
began with an equals,

100
00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:26.540
so we're going to type equals,

101
00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.315
and then we're going
to select O10.

102
00:04:29.315 --> 00:04:31.835
We want to check if this cell

103
00:04:31.835 --> 00:04:34.370
contains the same value as K1.

104
00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.660
But you'll notice it's put an
absolute cell referencing,

105
00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.310
and we don't want that
because in a moment,

106
00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.470
we're going to copy this
format to the other cells.

107
00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:47.095
I'm just going to press F4
three times to turn that off.

108
00:04:47.095 --> 00:04:50.195
Now, I'm going to type my
equals and I'm going to check

109
00:04:50.195 --> 00:04:53.250
if this cell is equal to K1.

110
00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.105
Here, we do want the
absolute cell reference.

111
00:04:56.105 --> 00:04:58.140
We don't get a default format,

112
00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.050
so we're going to click
our "Format" button

113
00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.060
and you can change
your number format,

114
00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:05.545
font, border or fill
or all of the above.

115
00:05:05.545 --> 00:05:08.630
We're going to make it any
color in the top rows,

116
00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.070
sticking with our color palette,

117
00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:11.855
and we're going to say, "OK",

118
00:05:11.855 --> 00:05:15.995
and "OK" again, and
it is now changed.

119
00:05:15.995 --> 00:05:19.565
I don't really want to repeat
that seven times though,

120
00:05:19.565 --> 00:05:21.020
and I don't have to.

121
00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.029
You can copy
conditional formatting,

122
00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:27.160
and you can do it using
conventional copy paste methods,

123
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.270
but there's a really
efficient option

124
00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.390
called the Format Painter.

125
00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:34.340
Making sure you've
still got O11 selected,

126
00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.140
we are going to come
up to Format Painter.

127
00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.495
One click gives you one copy.

128
00:05:38.495 --> 00:05:40.805
Double-click gives
you multiple copies.

129
00:05:40.805 --> 00:05:42.850
So we're going to double-click.

130
00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:45.980
When you bring your cursor
back into the workbook,

131
00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:47.765
you should see a
paintbrush attached.

132
00:05:47.765 --> 00:05:51.410
Now we're going to apply it
to our Queensland cells.

133
00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:53.230
That's going to be P11.

134
00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:56.060
It doesn't change because
this value is still empty,

135
00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:57.710
but we'll check it very shortly.

136
00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:00.725
Now, Western Australia
actually straddles two cells.

137
00:06:00.725 --> 00:06:04.730
So we're going to click on
N15 and then drag up to N14,

138
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:07.375
similar for South Australia,

139
00:06:07.375 --> 00:06:10.455
and just complete the rest.

140
00:06:10.455 --> 00:06:12.770
When you're done, click to turn

141
00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:15.730
the Format Painter
off or press escape.

142
00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:18.500
Now let's put our
map back into place,

143
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.270
just making sure that
the black circles

144
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:22.325
line up nicely with
the white circles.

145
00:06:22.325 --> 00:06:24.080
You can use your arrow keys to

146
00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.760
budget into position
if you need to.

147
00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:29.795
Let's go and test it.

148
00:06:29.795 --> 00:06:31.745
Coming back to our dropdown,

149
00:06:31.745 --> 00:06:36.005
I'm going to change NT to WA.

150
00:06:36.005 --> 00:06:38.225
That worked very nicely.

151
00:06:38.225 --> 00:06:39.875
Let's try another one.

152
00:06:39.875 --> 00:06:45.155
Tasmania. Fantastic. We've looked

153
00:06:45.155 --> 00:06:48.095
quite a few options for adding
conditional formatting.

154
00:06:48.095 --> 00:06:50.720
There's some great
efficient built-in options.

155
00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.120
But if you want real
creative control,

156
00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:56.980
you can add your own conditional
format using a rule.

157
00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:59.690
In the next video, we're
going to look at how we can

158
00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:02.140
apply conditional formatting
to an entire row.

159
00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:05.180
We're also going to
introduce macros to

160
00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:09.719
make our workbooks even more
interactive and automated.
