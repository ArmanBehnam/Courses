00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.200
In this video, we're going to

2
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.030
look at how to use custom number

3
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.105
formatting as an alternative
to conditional formats.

4
00:00:13.105 --> 00:00:15.075
Conditional formats are great.

5
00:00:15.075 --> 00:00:17.595
So why would we look
for an alternative?

6
00:00:17.595 --> 00:00:19.790
Well, we've already
seen that we're quite

7
00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:22.985
restricted in terms
of our icon choices.

8
00:00:22.985 --> 00:00:24.500
So that's one reason.

9
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.320
Another reason is with
very large datasets,

10
00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.940
you may find you start to get

11
00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.534
performance issues with
conditional formatting.

12
00:00:31.534 --> 00:00:33.320
Custom number formats are

13
00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.140
about three times more efficient.

14
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.440
In this example, Ron
would like to have

15
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.110
some icons for our
core waste production,

16
00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:43.510
very similar to those,

17
00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.995
as we have for our
resource recovery rates.

18
00:00:45.995 --> 00:00:48.035
The differences is, he would like

19
00:00:48.035 --> 00:00:50.105
all the positive values to have

20
00:00:50.105 --> 00:00:52.820
a red triangle pointing
upwards and the

21
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.170
negative values to have

22
00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.505
a green triangle
pointing downwards.

23
00:00:56.505 --> 00:01:00.010
With the conditional formatting
icons available to us,

24
00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.615
this is not possible.

25
00:01:01.615 --> 00:01:05.470
So he's going to have to
use a custom number format.

26
00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.720
Before we solve that
problem though,

27
00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.055
let's take a moment to

28
00:01:09.055 --> 00:01:12.470
understand how
number formats work.

29
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.640
If you click on cell where

30
00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.365
no formatting has been applied,

31
00:01:17.365 --> 00:01:19.120
you will see it is
set to general,

32
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.990
which means no format.

33
00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.930
You can however, go and apply

34
00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.490
one of the standard formats.

35
00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.950
For example, if I
click the drop-down,

36
00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.695
there are a whole lot of
standard formats to choose from,

37
00:01:29.695 --> 00:01:33.200
including currency,
accounting, and percentage.

38
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.085
If you don't want any
of those, however,

39
00:01:36.085 --> 00:01:39.515
you can create your own
custom number format.

40
00:01:39.515 --> 00:01:42.390
To do that, there
are few options.

41
00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.700
You can click on

42
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:44.780
the dialog launcher at

43
00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.760
the bottom of the
number format group,

44
00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.185
or the keyboard
shortcut is Control 1.

45
00:01:51.185 --> 00:01:54.230
When we open up our
Format Cells dialog,

46
00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.570
you see it's gone to
the Number format tab,

47
00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:57.980
and at the moment these numbers

48
00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.380
are formatted as percentage.

49
00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.960
To create a custom
format, we select Custom.

50
00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.795
We then type in the formatting
we want in the type box,

51
00:02:08.795 --> 00:02:11.435
and we'll see a sample
come up over here.

52
00:02:11.435 --> 00:02:15.640
For example, if I were
to put another zero,

53
00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.640
you'll see the sample change to

54
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.815
show me two decimal places.

55
00:02:19.815 --> 00:02:21.885
I'm going to go back to one.

56
00:02:21.885 --> 00:02:24.540
With custom number formats,

57
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.050
we have the option to

58
00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.110
specify how our
positive values look,

59
00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.105
how our negative values look,

60
00:02:31.105 --> 00:02:33.095
how zeros are formatted,

61
00:02:33.095 --> 00:02:35.045
and how text is formatted.

62
00:02:35.045 --> 00:02:40.300
So four options, and each is
separated by a semicolon.

63
00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.240
You don't have to
specify all of them and

64
00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.085
we're not going to worry
to specify the text.

65
00:02:46.085 --> 00:02:47.985
With this first example,

66
00:02:47.985 --> 00:02:49.960
what we'd like to
do is have all of

67
00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.035
our positive values turn green,

68
00:02:53.035 --> 00:02:55.660
our negative values show as red,

69
00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.655
and our zeros not show all.

70
00:02:58.655 --> 00:03:01.090
Right at the beginning
before the zero,

71
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.460
I'm going to type
a bracket and type

72
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.610
the word green and close
my square bracket.

73
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.470
This is saying show
positive values as

74
00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.060
green in the format 0.0 percent.

75
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.335
I'm then going to
type a semicolon.

76
00:03:16.335 --> 00:03:19.970
The next section is how my
negative values should look.

77
00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.200
I'm going open my square
bracket, type red,

78
00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:30.900
close my square bracket and
make it minus 0.0 percent.

79
00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.950
Then I'm going to type
another semicolon,

80
00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.490
and in this section
I specify how I want

81
00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:39.050
my zero values to

82
00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:40.790
look and I don't want
to see them at all.

83
00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.255
So I'm going to leave
that completely empty.

84
00:03:43.255 --> 00:03:46.660
When I now click ''Okay'',

85
00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.195
my custom number format
has been applied.

86
00:03:50.195 --> 00:03:53.645
That's the principle.
We now want to

87
00:03:53.645 --> 00:03:57.440
use icons instead of
those percentages.

88
00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.000
First thing we're
going to need to

89
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.205
do is actually get the icons.

90
00:04:01.205 --> 00:04:03.320
I'm going to click into "I3",

91
00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.990
we just need a blank cell here,

92
00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:07.970
and we're going to come to
our Insert tab on our ribbon,

93
00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.775
and on the far right
you'll find symbols.

94
00:04:10.775 --> 00:04:13.025
You'll choose Symbols and Symbol,

95
00:04:13.025 --> 00:04:16.900
and there are a lot of
alphabets you can choose from.

96
00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.779
For example, if I were
to type in Wingdings,

97
00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:23.150
you'll see we've got
Wingdings, Wingdings 2,

98
00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.145
Wingdings 3, and coming
in here, lots of symbols.

99
00:04:27.145 --> 00:04:28.790
The downside of using

100
00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:30.530
something like Wingdings
is you'll need to

101
00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.270
remember to change the font

102
00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.410
in that column to be Wingdings,

103
00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.300
and if somebody changes
it to something else,

104
00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:37.785
you're going to lose your icon.

105
00:04:37.785 --> 00:04:39.780
You're probably safer of going

106
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.180
with a standard font like Arial.

107
00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.310
I'm going go back to Arial.

108
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.105
Again, there are lots of
icons you can choose from,

109
00:04:47.105 --> 00:04:48.980
but you can narrow
down the subsets.

110
00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:50.960
I'm going click the
drop-down and scroll

111
00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.210
down till you get to
geometric shapes.

112
00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.890
You will need to scroll
down quite a bit.

113
00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:59.165
In the Geometric Shapes section,

114
00:04:59.165 --> 00:05:00.650
we don't get a massive selection,

115
00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.720
but we get some smiley
faces which are good,

116
00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.625
and we get the ones we need,

117
00:05:04.625 --> 00:05:06.775
the up arrow and the down arrow.

118
00:05:06.775 --> 00:05:08.590
I'm going to double-click on

119
00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.365
the up arrow and double-click
on the down arrow,

120
00:05:11.365 --> 00:05:13.030
and then just click ''Close''.

121
00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:14.830
Then let's copy
those so we've got

122
00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:16.510
them on our clipboard
when we need them,

123
00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:18.995
so Control C and Enter.

124
00:05:18.995 --> 00:05:20.800
Now we don't actually want

125
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.485
these percentages to disappear.

126
00:05:22.485 --> 00:05:25.060
We want to see the icon
in the column next to it.

127
00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.220
Let's do what we did previously.

128
00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.890
I'm going to come
into J5, type equals,

129
00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:32.340
click on "I5" and
press ''Enter''.

130
00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:33.760
Then I'm going to
select the value

131
00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.930
and double-click to copy down.

132
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.070
We're now going to
replace the formatting in

133
00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:42.145
this column with our
own custom format.

134
00:05:42.145 --> 00:05:44.510
Keyboard shortcut, Control 1,

135
00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:47.010
and here's our number
format dialog.

136
00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:49.650
Again, we're going
to choose Custom,

137
00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:52.180
and then where we've
got the type box,

138
00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.605
we're actually going to
remove that altogether.

139
00:05:54.605 --> 00:05:56.940
You can see it's gone to General.

140
00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.190
Now we've decided that
with our positive values,

141
00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:02.830
we actually want to see them
as red in this example.

142
00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:05.405
I'm going to open my square
bracket and type red,

143
00:06:05.405 --> 00:06:07.095
close my square bracket,

144
00:06:07.095 --> 00:06:09.135
and then I'm going
to paste my icons.

145
00:06:09.135 --> 00:06:12.925
So Control V and Backspace
to remove the down arrow.

146
00:06:12.925 --> 00:06:14.860
What I'm saying here is,

147
00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:17.124
if the value is positive,

148
00:06:17.124 --> 00:06:19.905
I want it to show a red triangle.

149
00:06:19.905 --> 00:06:21.695
Now type a semicolon.

150
00:06:21.695 --> 00:06:24.505
If it's negative, I
want the green color,

151
00:06:24.505 --> 00:06:27.280
so I'm going to type green,
close my square bracket.

152
00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.125
Again, paste Control V,

153
00:06:29.125 --> 00:06:31.820
but this time remove
your upward triangle

154
00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:34.605
and leave your downward triangle.

155
00:06:34.605 --> 00:06:38.760
If it's neither, I want
to leave it empty.

156
00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:43.280
I'm just going to type a
semicolon and then say Okay.

157
00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.315
Looks very much like
a conditional format,

158
00:06:46.315 --> 00:06:49.540
but that's actually a
custom number format.

159
00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:52.900
We can further refine these.

160
00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:56.290
Ron has two issues with this.

161
00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:58.810
The first thing is he
doesn't necessarily want

162
00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:01.315
to apply it to positives
and negatives.

163
00:07:01.315 --> 00:07:03.010
He actually wants to apply

164
00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:06.925
the red triangles if the
value is one percent or over,

165
00:07:06.925 --> 00:07:09.190
and he want to apply
the green triangle if

166
00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:11.790
it's below negative one percent.

167
00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:14.460
So that's the first issue.
The second issue is,

168
00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:16.575
he's not that excited
about that green,

169
00:07:16.575 --> 00:07:19.355
he'd like to go for a
slightly darker green.

170
00:07:19.355 --> 00:07:22.310
Now, we actually have a
large selection of colors we

171
00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:25.305
can apply for custom
number formats,

172
00:07:25.305 --> 00:07:28.685
and these have all been
documented in your toolbox.

173
00:07:28.685 --> 00:07:31.070
You can go and use
that as a reference.

174
00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:35.165
For this example, the green
color we want is number 10.

175
00:07:35.165 --> 00:07:38.680
We're going to change
that green to number 10.

176
00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.205
Again, with your cell selected,

177
00:07:41.205 --> 00:07:42.300
we're going to press ''Control

178
00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:45.550
1'' and get our
number format open.

179
00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:47.460
The first thing we're
going to do is,

180
00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:49.290
we're going to replace the green,

181
00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:51.255
so I'm actually
going to select that

182
00:07:51.255 --> 00:07:53.500
and I'm going to type color,

183
00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:56.375
C-O-L-O-R, the American spelling,

184
00:07:56.375 --> 00:07:58.460
followed by the number I want.

185
00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:01.460
That's going to replace
the green for me.

186
00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:05.680
The next thing I need to
do is add those ranges,

187
00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.250
and I'm going to start
with the first one.

188
00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:10.010
I'm just going to
click just before

189
00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:12.415
the square bracket in red,

190
00:08:12.415 --> 00:08:15.500
and I'm going to add another
set of square brackets.

191
00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:17.375
So open my square bracket,

192
00:08:17.375 --> 00:08:19.610
and I'm going to say that I only

193
00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:22.190
want to see the
red up triangle if

194
00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:28.230
the value is greater than 0.01,

195
00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:30.075
and then close my
square brackets.

196
00:08:30.075 --> 00:08:32.505
Remember we're working
with percentages.

197
00:08:32.505 --> 00:08:36.900
Then I'm going to do the
same for my green one,

198
00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:40.385
my color 10, open
my square brackets,

199
00:08:40.385 --> 00:08:42.545
but here I only want
to see it if it's

200
00:08:42.545 --> 00:08:46.775
less than minus 0.01,

201
00:08:46.775 --> 00:08:49.105
and close my square bracket.

202
00:08:49.105 --> 00:08:52.414
If it doesn't fit into
either of those ranges,

203
00:08:52.414 --> 00:08:54.830
I'm just going to
show the color black.

204
00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:56.510
That's just going to
make sure that I don't

205
00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:58.625
get something odd showing up.

206
00:08:58.625 --> 00:09:01.025
There's our custom number format.

207
00:09:01.025 --> 00:09:03.500
I'm now going to click ''Okay'',

208
00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:05.720
and you'll see the green has

209
00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:07.985
altered to a slightly
more muted green,

210
00:09:07.985 --> 00:09:12.290
and we're only getting the
icons for the ranges we want.

211
00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:15.680
Enormously powerful
and actually easier to

212
00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:19.700
do with custom number formats
in conditional formatting.

213
00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:22.395
There's a really
handy alternative

214
00:09:22.395 --> 00:09:24.740
if you're concerned about
performance issues,

215
00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:27.520
or you want to use
your own icons.

216
00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:29.915
In the tool box, we've documented

217
00:09:29.915 --> 00:09:32.030
a more complete set of rules

218
00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:34.280
for how to work with
custom number formats.

219
00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:36.725
So good idea to go
and check that out.

220
00:09:36.725 --> 00:09:39.530
Don't forget to do this
week's practice challenge,

221
00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:41.480
which will give you
great practice with

222
00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:45.780
all the skills we've learned
this week. Have fun with it.
