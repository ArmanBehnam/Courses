00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:07.530
In this video, we're going to

2
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:09.690
look at how we can
make our data more

3
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.340
self-documenting by

4
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.890
applying trend-based
conditional formats.

5
00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:16.380
A conditional format
is where Excel will

6
00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:19.690
make a cell look different
based on some criteria.

7
00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:22.460
With the trend-based
conditional formats,

8
00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.340
it compares a dataset
against itself and basically

9
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.750
ranks all the values in

10
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.020
that data and applies
formatting accordingly.

11
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.550
In this case scenario,

12
00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.270
Rowan has been given data
on waste management in

13
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.550
Australian states and
asked to make it easy for

14
00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.060
people to quickly spot
trends and anomalies.

15
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.200
For example, we're
going to scroll down to

16
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.170
our Resource and recovery
and recycling rates.

17
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.230
Rowan would like to make it very

18
00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.140
obvious where we're producing
large amounts of landfill.

19
00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:00.685
We're going to select the
data from E30 down to E37,

20
00:01:00.685 --> 00:01:02.930
and then we're going to
come up to our Home tab in

21
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.025
our ribbon and click
"Conditional Formatting."

22
00:01:06.025 --> 00:01:08.340
The first two options

23
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.070
are value-based
conditional formats,

24
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.720
which we'll look at
in the next video.

25
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.540
Well, we're going to be
focusing on all these three,

26
00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:15.890
which are our trend-based.

27
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.635
We'll start with the color scale.

28
00:01:17.635 --> 00:01:19.730
Now, Rowan wants where we have

29
00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.355
a high level of landfill
for it to show in red,

30
00:01:22.355 --> 00:01:24.140
going through orange, yellow,

31
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.120
and green for the lower values.

32
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.760
To achieve that, we're
going to go for the red,

33
00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.475
yellow, green color scale.

34
00:01:30.475 --> 00:01:32.570
Then, as you hover over
the different options,

35
00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.210
you'll see you can choose
whichever one suits your data.

36
00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.000
I'm just going to click
to apply. Really easy.

37
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.975
You're not limited to just
a column or just a row,

38
00:01:42.975 --> 00:01:45.210
you can apply to an
entire block of data.

39
00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.340
Let's do the same for resource
recovery rates by region.

40
00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.955
I'm going to click on C18
and drag down to H25.

41
00:01:53.955 --> 00:01:56.675
Again, come to
conditional formats.

42
00:01:56.675 --> 00:01:59.000
Resource recovery
rates, we want the

43
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.685
high results recovery rates
this time to be green,

44
00:02:01.685 --> 00:02:03.680
so we're going to
come to color scales.

45
00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.755
I'm going to choose the
first option this time,

46
00:02:06.755 --> 00:02:10.040
and there's our data
nicely formatted.

47
00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.110
The potential downsides with

48
00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.140
the color scales is
they are quite busy

49
00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.610
and if you don't provide

50
00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.620
a key it might not be
totally intuitive.

51
00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.335
Let's look now at
how we can remove

52
00:02:21.335 --> 00:02:23.240
a conditional format
and then we'll apply

53
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.135
one that might be a little
better for this data.

54
00:02:26.135 --> 00:02:28.945
I'm going to come back to
Conditional Formatting,

55
00:02:28.945 --> 00:02:32.475
and this time I'm going to
come down to Clear Rules.

56
00:02:32.475 --> 00:02:34.550
You'll see you have the
option to clear from

57
00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.255
these selected cells or
from the entire sheet.

58
00:02:37.255 --> 00:02:41.925
We want to clear from selected
cells. Easy come, easy go.

59
00:02:41.925 --> 00:02:44.235
Still with your data selected,

60
00:02:44.235 --> 00:02:46.510
we're going to come back
to Conditional Formatting

61
00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:47.720
and this time we're
going to have a look

62
00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.025
at the Data Bars,

63
00:02:49.025 --> 00:02:51.110
hover over the different options.

64
00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.400
I'm going to go to
the light blue,

65
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.745
but you can choose
any color you like.

66
00:02:54.745 --> 00:02:58.010
You can see it's almost
like applying a chart.

67
00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.220
The larger values, the bar is

68
00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.660
almost the whole way across

69
00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.265
the cell whereas
the smaller values,

70
00:03:04.265 --> 00:03:06.670
you get a much smaller bar.

71
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.670
Now, the way it works with

72
00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.525
all the trend-based
formats is by default,

73
00:03:11.525 --> 00:03:14.240
it starts with the lowest
value as the bottom of

74
00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.290
the set and the highest
value at the top of the set.

75
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.070
In a moment, we will
look at actually

76
00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:20.950
how you can modify that.

77
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.075
But for this one,
it's looking great.

78
00:03:23.075 --> 00:03:25.340
We're just going to left-align

79
00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.370
the text and maybe
make it a size nine.

80
00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.510
One more example we're
going to look at,

81
00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.230
which is icon sets.

82
00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.780
We can apply the icon sets
to the data in the cell.

83
00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.445
But in this particular example,

84
00:03:40.445 --> 00:03:42.770
we'd actually like to put
it in a separate cell.

85
00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:45.005
Can I ask you to click into J18,

86
00:03:45.005 --> 00:03:47.690
type equals and click onto

87
00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.750
your cumulative growth rate
in I18 and press "Enter".

88
00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.030
We'll then just click back and

89
00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.710
double-click the fill
handle to copy that down.

90
00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.410
Then, with your data
still selected,

91
00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.480
we're going to come up to
Conditional Formatting

92
00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.500
and come to Icon Sets.

93
00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.505
The icon sets allow you to

94
00:04:04.505 --> 00:04:06.650
categorize your data
really into three, four,

95
00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.700
or five categories, and

96
00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.520
the category we'd like to
use is the three triangles.

97
00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.085
So we're going to click
on that to apply it.

98
00:04:16.085 --> 00:04:17.570
Don't worry about
the hashes because

99
00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.175
we're going to get rid
of those in a moment.

100
00:04:19.175 --> 00:04:22.170
But once again, you
can see then it's

101
00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:25.665
taken the top third made
those green triangles,

102
00:04:25.665 --> 00:04:27.555
the middle third has
got the yellow lines,

103
00:04:27.555 --> 00:04:28.680
and the bottom third,

104
00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.745
because that value is quite
a lot lower than the others,

105
00:04:30.745 --> 00:04:33.110
has got the red triangle.

106
00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.110
But in this case it's
not what we want at all.

107
00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.870
We would like all of our
positive growth rates

108
00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:40.220
to have a green triangle and

109
00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.915
our negative ones to
have a red triangle,

110
00:04:41.915 --> 00:04:44.560
and if there's been no change,
to see the yellow line.

111
00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.530
We're now going to look
at how we can actually

112
00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.830
customize our conditional format.

113
00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.125
Again, make sure you've
got them selected,

114
00:04:51.125 --> 00:04:53.260
come back to
Conditional Formatting.

115
00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.390
We're now going to choose "Manage

116
00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:57.380
Rules" right at the bottom.

117
00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.480
By default, you will see

118
00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.615
the rules applying to
the current selection.

119
00:05:01.615 --> 00:05:03.770
But if you come up to where
it says Current Selection,

120
00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:04.910
you can actually switch to

121
00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.060
this worksheet and see all
the rules in your worksheet,

122
00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.920
and from here you can
delete rules you don't

123
00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.110
want or edit rules.

124
00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.420
We're going to edit
the icon set rules,

125
00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:18.390
so we're going to click on it
and then click "Edit Rule."

126
00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.830
We could switch it out for

127
00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:23.930
a completely different
trend-based format if

128
00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.380
we wanted and you can
mix and match the icons,

129
00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.175
but you have to select
from the icons provided.

130
00:05:30.175 --> 00:05:32.970
You can also change
the boundaries.

131
00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:34.310
You can see at the
moment it's making

132
00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:37.160
the top 33 percent green.

133
00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.290
We actually want all the
positive numbers to be green.

134
00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:42.140
We're going to switch percent to

135
00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:46.400
number and then we're going
to say greater than zero.

136
00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.920
It doesn't include zero.

137
00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:49.740
Then, the second group,

138
00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.540
we're going to make
that number as well.

139
00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:53.900
I'm going to say greater
than or equal to zero.

140
00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.160
Now, that seems a bit odd,

141
00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.510
but the ones that are
greater than zero are

142
00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:58.025
already getting a green triangle.

143
00:05:58.025 --> 00:06:00.410
This will only pick
up the equal to zero,

144
00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:02.695
and everything else will
get a red triangle.

145
00:06:02.695 --> 00:06:05.565
One more thing, we want
to show icons only.

146
00:06:05.565 --> 00:06:06.930
I'm going to tick in that box,

147
00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:08.985
and we're going to say Okay.

148
00:06:08.985 --> 00:06:11.420
At this point you don't
have to press "Apply"

149
00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:13.370
unless you want to do
something else in this dialog.

150
00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:17.420
You can just click "Okay"
and there are icons clearly

151
00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:19.160
showing where there's been

152
00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.810
an increase or a decrease in
our cumulative growth rate.

153
00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:24.810
We've looked at three types

154
00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:27.095
of trained-based
conditional formats.

155
00:06:27.095 --> 00:06:28.820
In the next video,
we're going to have

156
00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:32.190
a look at value-based
conditional formatting.
