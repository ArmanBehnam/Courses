1
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.745
In an age now driven by big data,

2
00:00:05.745 --> 00:00:08.460
we need to cut through
the noise and present

3
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.410
key information in
a way that can be

4
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.570
quickly consumed and acted upon.

5
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.520
Making data visualization

6
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.755
an increasingly important skill.

7
00:00:16.755 --> 00:00:19.110
Visualizations need
to not only present

8
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.945
data in an easy to understand
and attractive way,

9
00:00:21.945 --> 00:00:25.260
but they must put the data
into context and tell a story,

10
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.535
striking that fine balance
between form and function.

11
00:00:29.535 --> 00:00:32.100
Excel has many
rivals in the space,

12
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.270
but it is still an
excellent choice,

13
00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.889
particularly if that's
where your data resides.

14
00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:39.020
It offers a wealth of tools for

15
00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.030
creating visualizations
other than

16
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.475
charts and the chart
options available

17
00:00:43.475 --> 00:00:46.070
are constantly increasing
and improving.

18
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.505
In newer versions, you now
have waterfall charts,

19
00:00:49.505 --> 00:00:52.625
sunburst diagrams,
and even maps charts.

20
00:00:52.625 --> 00:00:56.630
But what really sets excel
apart is its flexibility.

21
00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.660
It gives us total creative
control over our designs.

22
00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.730
If need be, we could produce

23
00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.740
our own animated custom chart

24
00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.625
to tell the right
story for our data.

25
00:01:06.625 --> 00:01:08.750
Over four weeks, we will explore

26
00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.020
Excel Switch Selection of
visualization tools using

27
00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.180
practical case studies
as seen through

28
00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.465
the eyes of Rowan, an
environmental analyst.

29
00:01:17.465 --> 00:01:19.430
Rowan is required to produce

30
00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.000
visualizations that will
show trends, forecasts,

31
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.540
breakdowns, and comparisons
for a large variety

32
00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.865
of environmental data sets.

33
00:01:28.865 --> 00:01:32.075
As well as utilizing
the usual chart types,

34
00:01:32.075 --> 00:01:34.685
Rowan wants to use
conditional formats,

35
00:01:34.685 --> 00:01:37.355
spark lines, specialized shots,

36
00:01:37.355 --> 00:01:41.405
and even create his own animated
shots and info-graphics.

37
00:01:41.405 --> 00:01:43.490
In some cases, he will also

38
00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.440
need to prepare the data using

39
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.060
pivot tables to drill

40
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.165
down and answer very
specific questions.

41
00:01:50.165 --> 00:01:53.495
We are going to help him
achieve all this and present

42
00:01:53.495 --> 00:01:56.645
our finished visualizations
in attractive reports

43
00:01:56.645 --> 00:01:59.360
and dashboards that
use tools like

44
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.415
slicers and macros for
automation and interactivity.

45
00:02:04.415 --> 00:02:07.160
These are the topics
we will cover.

46
00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.540
In Week 1, we look at

47
00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:11.255
dynamic visualizations with
conditional formatting,

48
00:02:11.255 --> 00:02:14.960
custom number formatting,
spark lines, and macros.

49
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.180
Week 2, we'll explore charting

50
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.565
techniques for telling
the right story.

51
00:02:19.565 --> 00:02:24.095
Week 3, we explore more
specialized and custom charts.

52
00:02:24.095 --> 00:02:26.630
Week 4, we'll look
at summarizing and

53
00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.740
filtering our data with pivot
tables and pivot charts.

54
00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.150
Week 5, we put it all together by

55
00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.984
creating stunning
interactive dashboards.

56
00:02:34.984 --> 00:02:36.740
This is the second course in

57
00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.790
our specialization on data
analytics and visualization.

58
00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.750
The first course, Excel
Fundamentals for Data Analysis,

59
00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.270
covers data preparation
and cleaning,

60
00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:48.650
but also teach us some of

61
00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.465
the prerequisites
for this course,

62
00:02:50.465 --> 00:02:52.790
like tables and named ranges,

63
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.630
as well as text, lookup,
and logical functions.

64
00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.790
To get the most out
of this course,

65
00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:59.930
we would recommend you do

66
00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.500
the first course or have
experience with these topics.

67
00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.555
In this course, we focus on
data visualizations in Excel.

68
00:03:08.555 --> 00:03:12.360
Join us on this exciting journey.
