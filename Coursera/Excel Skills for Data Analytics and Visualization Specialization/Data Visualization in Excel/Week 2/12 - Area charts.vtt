1
00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:09.045
In this video, we are going
to work with area charts.

2
00:00:09.045 --> 00:00:11.820
Area charts are very
similar to line chats,

3
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.280
in that they show
change over time.

4
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.870
The key difference being,

5
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.670
that the area
between the line and

6
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.920
the x-axis is shaded in.

7
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.550
For example, taking
our long-term CO2,

8
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.265
I'm going to come up
to "Chart Design",

9
00:00:26.265 --> 00:00:28.305
come to "Change Chart Type",

10
00:00:28.305 --> 00:00:29.985
come down to "Area",

11
00:00:29.985 --> 00:00:31.785
and choose area chart,

12
00:00:31.785 --> 00:00:33.630
and when I say "Okay",

13
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.595
very similar, but arguably,

14
00:00:35.595 --> 00:00:37.335
a little bit more eye-catching.

15
00:00:37.335 --> 00:00:40.490
There are, however, situations
where the area chart may

16
00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.730
prove to be a more
effective visualization.

17
00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.655
Let's look at an example.

18
00:00:45.655 --> 00:00:48.665
We are going to come to
emissions by region,

19
00:00:48.665 --> 00:00:51.260
and Rowan has already
created a line chart,

20
00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.120
tracking the increase
in emissions

21
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.965
by the major world regions.

22
00:00:54.965 --> 00:00:57.710
Unfortunately this
chart is really messy,

23
00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.250
and so not so easy to read.

24
00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.810
What Rowan would
ideally like to show is

25
00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.795
the proportional increase
by region in emissions,

26
00:01:05.795 --> 00:01:08.015
as well as the total increase,

27
00:01:08.015 --> 00:01:11.855
and he can do this by using
a stacked area chart.

28
00:01:11.855 --> 00:01:14.195
Very similar to the
stacked column chart

29
00:01:14.195 --> 00:01:16.970
we saw in our first
topic this week.

30
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.275
We're going to click on the
"Emissions by Region" chart,

31
00:01:21.275 --> 00:01:24.710
and we're going to come
to "Change Chart Type".

32
00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.435
We're going to come
down to "Area",

33
00:01:27.435 --> 00:01:30.800
and if we were to choose just
the standard area chart,

34
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.695
you can see that's not really
going to solve the problem.

35
00:01:33.695 --> 00:01:35.660
If anything, it's
making it worse,

36
00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:36.890
because I can't see

37
00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.520
all the areas that are
hidden behind the others.

38
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.815
I'm not going to
choose that option.

39
00:01:42.815 --> 00:01:44.300
I'm going to choose the "Stacked

40
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.160
Area", we're going to say,

41
00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.380
"Okay", and there is a

42
00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.760
very attractive,
and readable chart.

43
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.980
Great. Let's copy that.

44
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.830
Just click on the
edge, Control C,

45
00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.215
come back to our line and area,

46
00:01:58.215 --> 00:02:01.720
and we'll just pop that into B31.

47
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.320
Now we've got one final example

48
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.630
that we're going to
create from scratch.

49
00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.060
We are going to come
to our last tab,

50
00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.385
which are emissions by sector,

51
00:02:13.385 --> 00:02:16.805
but here Rowan wants to do
something quite different.

52
00:02:16.805 --> 00:02:18.350
He actually wants to see how

53
00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.800
the different sectors proportional
contributions to CO2,

54
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.680
have changed over time.

55
00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.160
We're not looking for

56
00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.660
the actual amount,
but the proportion.

57
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.600
A bit more like a pie chart.

58
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.345
For this, we're going to use
a 100 percent stacked chart.

59
00:02:33.345 --> 00:02:36.019
Start by clicking into C3,

60
00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:37.835
hold Control Shift down,

61
00:02:37.835 --> 00:02:39.350
and press your right arrow,

62
00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.020
and your down arrow.

63
00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.845
Then release Control and Shift,

64
00:02:43.845 --> 00:02:47.045
and then we're going to
come to our "Insert".

65
00:02:47.045 --> 00:02:49.835
We're going to come
across to line chart,

66
00:02:49.835 --> 00:02:53.230
but we're going to choose the
100 percent stacked area,

67
00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:54.650
and this will show us

68
00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.110
the percentage contribution
of each of our sectors.

69
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.574
With the chart still selected,

70
00:03:01.574 --> 00:03:03.465
we're going to come to "Format",

71
00:03:03.465 --> 00:03:05.370
and we're going to make it again,

72
00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.395
14 high by 24 wide,

73
00:03:07.395 --> 00:03:09.045
like the last video,

74
00:03:09.045 --> 00:03:11.440
and now I'm just
going to move it up

75
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.110
so you can see it more easily.

76
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.130
Again, we're going to need
to fix our horizontal axis.

77
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:19.570
So good revision.

78
00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.460
We can come to "Chart Design",

79
00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.785
"Select Data", click "Edit,

80
00:03:23.785 --> 00:03:26.150
under Horizontal Category Axis.

81
00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.450
Click onto 1960, and
Control Shift down arrow,

82
00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.990
and then press Enter,
and click "Okay".

83
00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:37.600
Of course, we should give
this chart a proper title.

84
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.670
Clicking into "Chart Title",

85
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.860
I'm going to press Control A,

86
00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.020
and type emissions by sector.

87
00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.610
Then one final little formatting
tweak we'd like to make,

88
00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.175
instead of showing the
labels on the legend,

89
00:03:52.175 --> 00:03:54.830
we would actually like to see
the labels on the segments,

90
00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:56.965
again, more like a pie chart.

91
00:03:56.965 --> 00:03:59.915
We are going to come to
our "Chart Elements",

92
00:03:59.915 --> 00:04:02.260
we're going to turn
off our Legend,

93
00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.775
and instead we're going to
turn our Data Labels on.

94
00:04:05.775 --> 00:04:08.230
But, oh, dear, what a mess.

95
00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.565
Instead of putting
the series label,

96
00:04:10.565 --> 00:04:12.610
it's put the value labels.

97
00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:14.520
But we can easily change this.

98
00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.775
Click onto one set
of data labels,

99
00:04:17.775 --> 00:04:21.020
and then another way to get
that panel on the right open,

100
00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:22.430
we're going to right-click,

101
00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.485
and "Format Data Labels".

102
00:04:24.485 --> 00:04:27.515
Now you see at the moment
it's showing the value.

103
00:04:27.515 --> 00:04:29.490
We're going to antique value,

104
00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.440
and turn Series Name on.

105
00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.710
Now unfortunately, we have to do

106
00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.545
these one at a time,
but it's pretty quick.

107
00:04:36.545 --> 00:04:38.580
We're just going
to antique value,

108
00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.130
turn on series, and then

109
00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:43.590
repeat that for
each of our series.

110
00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.840
Now, this will probably look
a little better in white.

111
00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.990
I'm going to come to my
"Home" tab, make them white,

112
00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.120
maybe increase the size,

113
00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.730
and then to apply
that to the others,

114
00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:01.000
I'm going to use
my Format Painter.

115
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.140
I'm going to double-click
the "Format Painter",

116
00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:08.645
and then just single-click
onto each of my labels.

117
00:05:08.645 --> 00:05:11.820
We should apply the
same formatting.

118
00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.060
Then single-click on your "Format

119
00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.950
Painter" again, to turn it off.

120
00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:22.085
Now let's select our
whole chart, Control C,

121
00:05:22.085 --> 00:05:25.115
come back to our
line and area chart,

122
00:05:25.115 --> 00:05:26.990
pop it into P31 to

123
00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.235
complete your emissions
overview reports.

124
00:05:30.235 --> 00:05:32.930
One last thing we're
going to talk about in

125
00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:35.144
this video, and that's colors.

126
00:05:35.144 --> 00:05:37.175
When we're using visualizations,

127
00:05:37.175 --> 00:05:39.565
obviously, colors
are very important,

128
00:05:39.565 --> 00:05:42.425
and it may be that the
colors you see here,

129
00:05:42.425 --> 00:05:44.665
will not represent
your organization

130
00:05:44.665 --> 00:05:47.620
or the type of data that
you're trying to represent.

131
00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.485
Now there are two ways
you can approach this.

132
00:05:50.485 --> 00:05:53.860
For example, come into
Emissions by Region.

133
00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:57.205
These two last series are
not really standing out.

134
00:05:57.205 --> 00:05:59.990
I'm going to click on
the second last series,

135
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:02.610
and I'm going to come
to my "Format" tab,

136
00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:05.790
and I'm going to come
to my "Shape Fill",

137
00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:08.370
and you've got some Theme Colors.

138
00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:10.200
Generally, I'd recommend, use

139
00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.460
the Theme Colors, but
if you don't want to,

140
00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:14.690
you can come to
"More Fill Colors"

141
00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:18.125
"Custom" and there's so
much you can choose from.

142
00:06:18.125 --> 00:06:20.670
I'm going to come
back to "Standard",

143
00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:22.840
and I'm going to go for quite a

144
00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.135
dark blue and say, "Okay".

145
00:06:25.135 --> 00:06:27.445
I'm going to choose
my last series,

146
00:06:27.445 --> 00:06:30.350
and I'm just going to
make that a light blue.

147
00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:32.850
That's one way you
could approach it.

148
00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:35.380
But we've already created
quite a lot of charts,

149
00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:37.780
and to manually go
and change each of

150
00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:40.285
the colors in each
of those charts,

151
00:06:40.285 --> 00:06:42.920
is going to be very
time-consuming,

152
00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:46.695
and we also run the risk
of losing consistency.

153
00:06:46.695 --> 00:06:50.800
A better approach is to come
to your "Page Layout" tab,

154
00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.840
come to the "Themes" button,

155
00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.975
which controls the colors
used within your workbook,

156
00:06:55.975 --> 00:07:00.740
and you'll see, as I hover
over the different themes,

157
00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:04.180
it completely changes
the color scheme,

158
00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:07.960
and sometimes the font
scheme within your workbook.

159
00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.945
When you find one that
you like the look of,

160
00:07:10.945 --> 00:07:13.840
you can click, to
apply the changes.

161
00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.844
Now you'll notice that
has also changed my font,

162
00:07:16.844 --> 00:07:18.805
and if I don't want
that to happen,

163
00:07:18.805 --> 00:07:20.395
you can mix and match.

164
00:07:20.395 --> 00:07:22.510
If I come back to "Fonts",

165
00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:25.255
I can just set it
back to "Calibri",

166
00:07:25.255 --> 00:07:28.435
and you could just go
and change your colors.

167
00:07:28.435 --> 00:07:30.430
You even have the option to come

168
00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:32.200
down to Customize Colors,

169
00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:33.970
and you can go and set up

170
00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:36.579
your own colors
scheme altogether.

171
00:07:36.579 --> 00:07:39.575
We're not going to
do that now, though.

172
00:07:39.575 --> 00:07:42.190
You'll notice having
changed our colors,

173
00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:44.070
all the colors in the workbook,

174
00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:45.680
not just on this sheet,

175
00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:47.780
but on the pies and donuts,

176
00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:50.075
and the techniques, have changed

177
00:07:50.075 --> 00:07:53.290
except for those two blues
that I added before,

178
00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:56.700
and that's because they
weren't theme colors.

179
00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:59.210
The benefit of
using Theme Colors,

180
00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:00.935
is when you change your theme,

181
00:08:00.935 --> 00:08:03.055
the colors all change.

182
00:08:03.055 --> 00:08:04.875
Now I'm going to go back,

183
00:08:04.875 --> 00:08:06.250
I'm going to undo,

184
00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:08.690
and set it back to the
colors that I had before,

185
00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:10.990
because I really
like those colors.

186
00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:12.605
But you have a play,

187
00:08:12.605 --> 00:08:15.630
find a color scheme
that works for you.
