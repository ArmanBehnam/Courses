00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.470
In this video, we're
going to look at some of

2
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.740
the fundamental techniques
for working with charts.

3
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.800
In this example, Rowan
would like to create

4
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.120
a column chart to show

5
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.905
the CO_2 emissions by
different fuel types.

6
00:00:17.905 --> 00:00:20.780
He has prepared the data
by showing snapshots

7
00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.395
every 10 years from
1937 to the present.

8
00:00:24.395 --> 00:00:27.110
The first thing you need to
do is to select the data

9
00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.720
you want to be included
in your chart,

10
00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.095
and it's also very important
that you include the labels.

11
00:00:33.095 --> 00:00:35.900
We're going to select from
here all the way across

12
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.025
to other and not
include our totals.

13
00:00:39.025 --> 00:00:42.790
We're then going to come to
our Insert tab in our ribbon,

14
00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.250
and in the middle of the
Insert tab is our chart group,

15
00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.760
from which you can choose a
great selection of charts.

16
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.445
If you have the
Recommended Charts option,

17
00:00:52.445 --> 00:00:55.265
which is available in the
newer versions of Excel,

18
00:00:55.265 --> 00:00:57.695
that's really worth having
a look at as it will

19
00:00:57.695 --> 00:01:00.805
often give you the chart
type that you want.

20
00:01:00.805 --> 00:01:03.320
If you're working with an
older version of Excel,

21
00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.510
however, you may not have it.

22
00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.810
We're going to do
it the manual way.

23
00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.055
Now to create a column chart,

24
00:01:10.055 --> 00:01:12.350
you come to the
column chart icon,

25
00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.540
click the drop-down,
and then choose

26
00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.015
the column or bar chart you want.

27
00:01:17.015 --> 00:01:19.985
In this case, a 2-D
clustered column.

28
00:01:19.985 --> 00:01:21.485
There is, however,

29
00:01:21.485 --> 00:01:24.065
a keyboard shortcut that
you can use as well,

30
00:01:24.065 --> 00:01:25.940
and that is Alt+F1,

31
00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.370
and that gives you
a clustered column,

32
00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:29.960
which is great, where there is

33
00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.720
a cluster of columns
for each row.

34
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.495
Now probably the first
thing you want to do

35
00:01:35.495 --> 00:01:38.440
is move and resize your chart.

36
00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.460
When moving, do be careful

37
00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.575
not to select a
piece of the chart,

38
00:01:42.575 --> 00:01:45.010
because then you'll
just move that piece,

39
00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.830
in which case immediately undo.

40
00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.750
Stay near the edges of

41
00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.285
the chart and then
just click and drag.

42
00:01:53.285 --> 00:01:55.690
To resize, you can use any of

43
00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.420
the resize handles and
you just click and

44
00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.430
drag away from the
middle to make it

45
00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.625
bigger or towards the
middle to make it smaller,

46
00:02:03.625 --> 00:02:05.690
and there is our chart.

47
00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.100
But there is one
immediate problem,

48
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.180
our years have not appeared on

49
00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.985
our x-axis/ if you look closely,

50
00:02:12.985 --> 00:02:15.265
they've actually
appeared as a series,

51
00:02:15.265 --> 00:02:17.494
and that's because
they are numbers,

52
00:02:17.494 --> 00:02:19.630
and as far as Excel is concerned,

53
00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:20.935
if it sees a number,

54
00:02:20.935 --> 00:02:22.810
it tries to chart it.

55
00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.970
One of the first things
we're going to do

56
00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.215
is we have to address this issue.

57
00:02:27.215 --> 00:02:29.900
Now we need to remove year as

58
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.160
a series and there's

59
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.605
a really quick way
that you can do that.

60
00:02:33.605 --> 00:02:37.795
You'll notice all the data
is surrounded by a blue box.

61
00:02:37.795 --> 00:02:40.910
If I come to the corner
and click and drag,

62
00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.090
I can actually change
what data is included.

63
00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.280
I've removed it as a series,

64
00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.054
but now I need to
add it as labels.

65
00:02:49.054 --> 00:02:51.110
Now with your chart selected,

66
00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.500
you will notice you
have two new ribbons.

67
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.675
The names vary across
different versions of Excel,

68
00:02:56.675 --> 00:02:59.300
in this version, it's
called chart design.

69
00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.480
In older versions, you may
see chart tools design,

70
00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.160
either way, please click on

71
00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.030
this ribbon and then
come to Select Data.

72
00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.460
The Select Data dialog allows
you to manage exactly what

73
00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:14.120
data is or isn't
included in your chart.

74
00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.325
You could see, I could go and

75
00:03:16.325 --> 00:03:19.645
add and remove series over here.

76
00:03:19.645 --> 00:03:21.800
But more importantly, we can

77
00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.830
change our horizontal
axis labels.

78
00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.830
I'm going to click "Edit"
and then you literally

79
00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.575
just select the labels
you want to see included,

80
00:03:30.575 --> 00:03:32.725
and it's fixed already.

81
00:03:32.725 --> 00:03:37.065
I'm just going to say
"Okay", and "Okay. "

82
00:03:37.065 --> 00:03:40.565
Now it's quite possible that
having created your chart,

83
00:03:40.565 --> 00:03:42.545
you look at it and decide

84
00:03:42.545 --> 00:03:45.200
that a different chart
type might be better,

85
00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.050
and certainly with
this many data sets,

86
00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.440
this graphic is looking
a little bit busy.

87
00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.640
Let's have a look at
another alternative.

88
00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.320
We're going to come up to

89
00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:56.760
our Chart Design ribbon

90
00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.620
and we're going to
click "Change Chart

91
00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.635
Type" and we can swap this for

92
00:04:00.635 --> 00:04:03.485
any chart type that will
support this type of data,

93
00:04:03.485 --> 00:04:06.830
and a stacked column in this
case may be a better option.

94
00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:10.535
Do be careful there's also
100 percent stacked column,

95
00:04:10.535 --> 00:04:13.615
and that shows the stack
out of 100 percent,

96
00:04:13.615 --> 00:04:15.480
and that's not what we want.

97
00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.660
Make sure you've got
a stacked column

98
00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.330
and then say "Okay."

99
00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:21.530
What this has done is taken

100
00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:23.345
all of your little
clustered columns

101
00:04:23.345 --> 00:04:24.890
and pile them on top of each

102
00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:27.410
other so you can still
see the breakdown,

103
00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.720
but you can also
more easily compare

104
00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.170
the total emissions for
each year represented.

105
00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:35.330
Now let's talk about making

106
00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.340
our chart look a
little bit nicer.

107
00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.400
To begin with, on your
Chart Design tab,

108
00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.530
you'll see a gallery of styles,

109
00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.245
and as you hover over
these different styles,

110
00:04:45.245 --> 00:04:47.170
it gives you a preview.

111
00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:49.655
If you want even more options,

112
00:04:49.655 --> 00:04:51.530
you can click the drop down and

113
00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.070
you'll see even more
options in there.

114
00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:56.810
These are really
good quick options,

115
00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:58.700
but we're going to
do them manually so

116
00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.070
you can see all the alternatives.

117
00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.545
First of all, my legend,

118
00:05:03.545 --> 00:05:06.920
it looks fine, but I'd like
to change the position.

119
00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.530
I'm going to come to
this little green plus

120
00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.075
to the right of my chart,

121
00:05:11.075 --> 00:05:14.020
and this shows me all the
different components.

122
00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.824
From here, I can switch
them off altogether,

123
00:05:17.824 --> 00:05:19.955
which I don't want to
switch my legend off,

124
00:05:19.955 --> 00:05:21.590
so I'm going to turn it back on,

125
00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:24.620
and if I click the little black
arrow to the right of it,

126
00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.055
you'll see I can
change the position.

127
00:05:27.055 --> 00:05:30.080
If I were to move it to
the left, for example,

128
00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.445
you'll see it adjust the
whole chart accordingly.

129
00:05:33.445 --> 00:05:36.330
But I'd like to
see it at the top.

130
00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.600
Now I should probably also
change my chart title.

131
00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.420
Your chart title would normally

132
00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:43.280
show by default, but again,

133
00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.470
if it doesn't, you
can always just turn

134
00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:48.415
it on in the Chart
Elements dialogue.

135
00:05:48.415 --> 00:05:50.545
Clicking into my "Chart Title",

136
00:05:50.545 --> 00:05:53.215
I'm actually going to need
to replace this text.

137
00:05:53.215 --> 00:05:54.925
If you highlight
and press "Delete",

138
00:05:54.925 --> 00:05:57.200
you may delete your
title by mistake,

139
00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.110
so I suggest rather
press "Control A"

140
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:03.670
to select everything
and just over type.

141
00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:07.395
I'm just going to type
in Emissions by Fuel,

142
00:06:07.395 --> 00:06:09.735
and then you can just click away.

143
00:06:09.735 --> 00:06:13.525
Another thing I'd like to
address is my vertical axis.

144
00:06:13.525 --> 00:06:15.685
Because the numbers are so large,

145
00:06:15.685 --> 00:06:18.530
these numbers are actually
quite hard to understand,

146
00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:21.490
so I'm going to click on my
"Vertical Axis," and if you

147
00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:24.580
want even more options than
available from the plus,

148
00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:28.320
you can either right-click
Format or just double-click,

149
00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.600
and that will open up
a panel on the right,

150
00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.070
and this gives you the
full range of options

151
00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:36.215
for changing the components
within your chart.

152
00:06:36.215 --> 00:06:39.464
Now first of all, please
select the Axis Options,

153
00:06:39.464 --> 00:06:41.370
which is the little bar icon,

154
00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:44.415
and then we go to open
up Access Options,

155
00:06:44.415 --> 00:06:47.780
and the one we want to
change is the Display Units.

156
00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:50.050
These are such big numbers that

157
00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:52.585
I'm actually going
to set to billions.

158
00:06:52.585 --> 00:06:55.105
Not only is it much
more readable now,

159
00:06:55.105 --> 00:06:57.590
but it's also put
in a label for me.

160
00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:00.270
That was just one of many option,

161
00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:02.245
I encourage you to explore

162
00:07:02.245 --> 00:07:04.760
and see what else
you can do in here.

163
00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:07.915
Let's make one final
aesthetic tweak.

164
00:07:07.915 --> 00:07:11.560
I would like to make each of
these bars a little wider,

165
00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.750
so I'm going to
select one series,

166
00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:16.930
it doesn't matter which, and
that switches the gray panel

167
00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:18.100
over to show me

168
00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:21.010
the formatting options
for my data series.

169
00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:24.620
The gap width between these
columns is really wide,

170
00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:27.140
so I'm going to change
it to 50 percent,

171
00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:29.350
which reduces the gap width and

172
00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:32.095
thus increases the
width of each column,

173
00:07:32.095 --> 00:07:35.390
and I think that
looks much nicer now.

174
00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:37.915
One more thing Rowan wants to do,

175
00:07:37.915 --> 00:07:39.220
he'd like to include his

176
00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:41.410
percentage increase
in this chart.

177
00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:44.785
Now previously we saw how we
could just adjust this area,

178
00:07:44.785 --> 00:07:46.510
but that only works with data

179
00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:48.470
that's right next to each other,

180
00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:51.550
obviously this is not
sitting with that data.

181
00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:54.820
We can come to select
data and edit from there,

182
00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:57.670
but there's quite a neat trick
which is not as obvious,

183
00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:59.315
which I'd like to show you.

184
00:07:59.315 --> 00:08:02.320
We're actually going to
select the data from H3,

185
00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:05.645
including the heading and
right down to 16 percent,

186
00:08:05.645 --> 00:08:07.040
and I'm going to copy,

187
00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:09.940
Control C and then I'm
just going to click on

188
00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:11.290
the edge of the chart so it's

189
00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:13.130
selected and I'm going to paste,

190
00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:15.370
Control V. That has

191
00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:17.800
actually added my
percentage increase,

192
00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.465
but I can't see it,

193
00:08:19.465 --> 00:08:21.215
and the reason for that is

194
00:08:21.215 --> 00:08:23.690
these numbers are
going up in billions,

195
00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:27.265
whereas my percentage increases
are all less than one,

196
00:08:27.265 --> 00:08:31.810
so the values are so tiny that
I can't actually see them.

197
00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:35.150
In order to compare data
of different units,

198
00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:38.839
what you need to do is
to put in a second axis,

199
00:08:38.839 --> 00:08:40.490
and the easiest way to do

200
00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:42.860
that is to come to Chart Design,

201
00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:45.070
come to Change Chart Type,

202
00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:47.950
and right at the
bottom, choose Combo.

203
00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:49.745
Now it switched everything to

204
00:08:49.745 --> 00:08:51.815
clustered column for a moment,

205
00:08:51.815 --> 00:08:53.485
don't worry about that,

206
00:08:53.485 --> 00:08:55.665
we're just going to scroll down,

207
00:08:55.665 --> 00:08:57.620
and we actually like our other to

208
00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:00.215
go back to being
a stacked column,

209
00:09:00.215 --> 00:09:02.045
and you'll see when you do that,

210
00:09:02.045 --> 00:09:04.670
it switches everything
else back to stacked.

211
00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:08.180
We do want our percentage
increase to be a line,

212
00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:09.860
but the important
thing is we want

213
00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:12.260
that to be on a secondary axis.

214
00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.775
I'm going to tick and say "Okay."

215
00:09:15.775 --> 00:09:17.600
Now it has created

216
00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:21.085
a secondary axis showing
our percentages,

217
00:09:21.085 --> 00:09:23.480
and we can see our
percentage increase

218
00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:26.290
along with our billion
tons of emissions.

219
00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:28.530
There's our finished chart which

220
00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:31.510
is now looking very great.
