[MUSIC]
In this video, we're going to look at how

2
00:00:08.489 --> 00:00:12.260
we can show trends overtime using
line charts and trendlines.

3
00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:18.222
Well, you have change overtime and
you want to represent that graphically,

4
00:00:18.222 --> 00:00:21.050
a line chart can often
be a very good choice.

5
00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.069
And you can see Rohan has already
created a line chart tracking CO2

6
00:00:25.069 --> 00:00:29.920
concentrations from 800,000
years ago to the present.

7
00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:35.365
What he would like to do next is zoom in
on the most recent data from 1960 onwards,

8
00:00:35.365 --> 00:00:37.984
and again he'd like to use a line chart.

9
00:00:37.984 --> 00:00:41.513
What he'd also like to do then
is to get a projection for

10
00:00:41.513 --> 00:00:46.220
what our concentrations will
look like in 10 years time.

11
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.209
So we're going to start by coming
to our data which is in the CO2

12
00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:51.576
concentration tab.

13
00:00:51.576 --> 00:00:56.450
And we have the summarized version
in the second group over here.

14
00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.573
And we're going to select
our concentrations.

15
00:00:59.573 --> 00:01:02.987
Remember, we can't include
our years to begin with,

16
00:01:02.987 --> 00:01:05.890
we'll add those later as labels.

17
00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.339
So click into G3 we're
going to press control,

18
00:01:09.339 --> 00:01:13.050
shift down arrow,
scroll up a bit, come to insert.

19
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.690
Come to line charts and
we're going to choose a 2D line chart.

20
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.045
Now we'd like this line chart
to be exactly the same size as

21
00:01:23.045 --> 00:01:24.722
the one in the other sheet.

22
00:01:24.722 --> 00:01:27.402
So we're going to click
on our format tab and

23
00:01:27.402 --> 00:01:31.976
on the far right we have the options
to actually enter our height and width.

24
00:01:31.976 --> 00:01:35.440
So we're going to make this 14 by 24.

25
00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.260
And then if you like, you can just
move the chart up a little bit.

26
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.439
And we'd like to actually add
some styling to this chart, and

27
00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:46.070
this is best done early.

28
00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.655
So come to our chart design and
if you hover over your designs we will see

29
00:01:50.655 --> 00:01:56.340
some nice ones to choose from, but
the one we want in this case is style 4.

30
00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.438
This adds drop lines and
removes your grid lines.

31
00:01:59.438 --> 00:02:04.568
The first fix we're going to have to
make is to correct our horizontal axis,

32
00:02:04.568 --> 00:02:08.350
and this is much like we did
in our first topic this week.

33
00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.470
We're going to come to select data.

34
00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.430
We're going to click edit
under axis labels and

35
00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.648
then we're going to come to F4 and
press control shift down arrow.

36
00:02:18.648 --> 00:02:23.266
You'll notice I've actually taken
the years all the way up to 2028, and

37
00:02:23.266 --> 00:02:27.259
that's because when we add our trendline,
we want those labels.

38
00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:31.979
And you haven't put them up front,
you'll have to go and repeat this step.

39
00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:35.742
So we're just going to save
ourselves a little bit of time.

40
00:02:35.742 --> 00:02:38.003
And we're going to say, OK and OK.

41
00:02:38.003 --> 00:02:43.017
You'll see at the moment it's only going
up to 2018 because our data goes up to

42
00:02:43.017 --> 00:02:48.265
that, but when we add our trendline, it
will automatically add those other labels.

43
00:02:48.265 --> 00:02:51.686
Great, now another fix we
need to make is our heading.

44
00:02:51.686 --> 00:02:54.624
You can see although
this say CO2 correctly,

45
00:02:54.624 --> 00:02:58.251
that subscript has not come
through in our heading here.

46
00:02:58.251 --> 00:03:00.536
So we will have to manually fix that.

47
00:03:00.536 --> 00:03:05.282
So click into our chat title, highlight
the two and then we're going to come

48
00:03:05.282 --> 00:03:09.670
to our home tab, come to the font
group and click the little drop down.

49
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.370
Mac users, you'll need to go to your menu.

50
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.500
And we're going to choose subscripts and
OK, and that looks a lot better.

51
00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:26.074
Now, because our data starts all the way
up over 300, our curve looks very flat and

52
00:03:26.074 --> 00:03:32.420
we already have the context from the first
chart, so we're going to adjust the axis.

53
00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.266
So I'm going to double click on
the axis to open up my panel, and

54
00:03:36.266 --> 00:03:40.850
then I'm going to come to axis options and
I'm going to start it at 300.

55
00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.858
You need to be a little careful
with doing such a thing.

56
00:03:45.858 --> 00:03:49.579
In this case it's fine, but
it can be misleading in other cases.

57
00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:53.590
Because we have our previous chart,
our data is no longer misleading.

58
00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.880
And now we would like to
add a data label up here so

59
00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.110
we can see where our
missions got to in 2018.

60
00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:06.637
The problem is, if I just come in and
turn on data labels, there are so

61
00:04:06.637 --> 00:04:08.290
many that it gets messy.

62
00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.670
So I'm going to turn those off.

63
00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.450
And what we're going to do is make sure
you've clicked on your green line.

64
00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:20.240
And then we're going to click on one
of the data points that's visible.

65
00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:28.080
And then just come to the end of the green
line and select a single data point.

66
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.909
And with just the one data point selected,

67
00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:34.445
if you turn your data labels on,
you just get the one.

68
00:04:34.445 --> 00:04:36.860
So that looks great.

69
00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.500
Now let's add our trendline.

70
00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.510
If you come to chart elements,
you'll see trendline down here.

71
00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:48.110
And clicking on the black arrow, it will
give you a few options, but generally you

72
00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.059
need to come into more options when
you're working with trendlines.

73
00:04:52.059 --> 00:04:55.935
And then once you're in trendlines,
click on the trendline options.

74
00:04:55.935 --> 00:04:58.600
There are six trendlines
you can choose from and

75
00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.080
these account in a bit more
detail in your toolbox.

76
00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:07.210
By default, Excel will always select
linear, that means a constant trend.

77
00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:11.970
We can see that's not what we've got here,
so let's click on exponential.

78
00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:16.194
And it looks quite a lot better,
but how do we know if it's better?

79
00:05:16.194 --> 00:05:20.330
There's an option to turn
on an R-squared value.

80
00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.291
And R-squared value is a ratio.

81
00:05:22.291 --> 00:05:25.161
The higher the number and
the closer it is to one,

82
00:05:25.161 --> 00:05:28.960
the more closely the trendline
resembles your existing curve.

83
00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:35.217
And just clicking back on my trendline,
you can see with the linear it was

84
00:05:35.217 --> 00:05:40.540
0.98 but with the exponential
it's definitely a lot better.

85
00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:44.729
It's quite possible though,
that if you've got a dip in your curve or

86
00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:47.995
in this case where it seems
steeper than exponential,

87
00:05:47.995 --> 00:05:52.160
that you still not getting as
close a match as you'd like.

88
00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.850
So one option is then to try polynomial.

89
00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:01.150
These can be all the way from order
two through to an order six in Excel.

90
00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:04.721
And you can see for
this data with the polynomial order two,

91
00:06:04.721 --> 00:06:07.500
we've almost got an exact match.

92
00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.161
So we're going to turn
off our R-squared and

93
00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:13.874
now we're going to get a projection
forward for 10 periods.

94
00:06:13.874 --> 00:06:17.590
So where it says forward,
were going to type in a 10.

95
00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:23.196
And because our periods are in years, it
has put a projection all the way to 2028.

96
00:06:23.196 --> 00:06:28.091
Now, unfortunately, there's no
option to add labels on trendlines,

97
00:06:28.091 --> 00:06:31.700
but there is quite
a neat work around this.

98
00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:34.870
So we're going to come back
to our trendline options and

99
00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:38.000
we're going to display the equation.

100
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.090
This is the equation that has been
used to generate this trendline.

101
00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:46.910
What it's done, it's taken each data
point and remember these are just

102
00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:51.430
the numbers from 1 through to 69 and
applied this equation to it.

103
00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:54.850
So to get our point here,

104
00:06:54.850 --> 00:07:01.600
all we need to do is substitute the X
in this equation for the number 69.

105
00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:05.560
I'm going to click in and
select that equation.

106
00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:09.740
Control C to copy,
come to a blank cell and paste.

107
00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:14.500
And now what I need to do
is edit that equation.

108
00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:18.856
So I'm just going to double click and
we're going to get rid of the Y.

109
00:07:18.856 --> 00:07:21.730
So we start with an equal sign.

110
00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:26.790
And then we're going to replace the X
squared with the times by 69 to

111
00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:33.060
the power shift 6 and 2, so that little
character gives us to the power 2.

112
00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:37.630
And then I'm going to replace
this X by just times 69.

113
00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:39.610
And then I'm going to press Enter.

114
00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:44.119
And that is the value of
the data point in 2028.

115
00:07:44.119 --> 00:07:47.042
Now, if you'd like to
decrease your decimal,

116
00:07:47.042 --> 00:07:50.290
you can do that on your number formatting.

117
00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:53.011
And then to get that into the chart,

118
00:07:53.011 --> 00:07:57.100
we're going to click on our chat,
insert, shapes.

119
00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:00.760
We're going to grab a text box.

120
00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:02.420
Pop our text box in there.

121
00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:09.980
And then come into our formula bar, type
equals, click on our cell and press Enter.

122
00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:14.910
And then just resize your text box so
that it sits nicely.

123
00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:21.810
And if you click back on your trendline,
we can turn off your equation.

124
00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:27.290
One last thing,
let's fix our horizontal axis.

125
00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:29.210
So click on your horizontal axis.

126
00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:36.620
Come to positioning and change your
text direction to rotate 270 degrees.

127
00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:40.898
That's looking great, so
we can now copy this chart.

128
00:08:40.898 --> 00:08:45.650
Click on the edge, control C,
come to your line and area charts.

129
00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:49.210
Click in P3 and paste.

130
00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:53.595
So we've just seen how we
can use line charts and

131
00:08:53.595 --> 00:08:56.460
trendlines to visualize
trends in our data.
