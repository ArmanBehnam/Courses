00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.440
Last week we looked at
a range of options for

2
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.485
presenting our data
visually other than charts.

3
00:00:08.485 --> 00:00:10.270
This week, we're going to get

4
00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:12.280
stuck into charts themselves.

5
00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.665
Niki, what are the
objectives for this week?

6
00:00:15.665 --> 00:00:17.650
This week we're going to focus on

7
00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.855
creating the standard
charts in Excel,

8
00:00:19.855 --> 00:00:21.700
but we're going to dig
a little bit deeper to

9
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.650
see how we get the most
out of these charts

10
00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:25.000
and we're going to
focus on some of

11
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.760
the more advanced
techniques like dual axes,

12
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.980
trend lines, and combo charts.

13
00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.290
While the videos will
focus very much on

14
00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.080
how we go about
creating these charts,

15
00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.119
we have to first make a decision

16
00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:39.935
on which chart type
to actually use.

17
00:00:39.935 --> 00:00:42.675
There's a great quote
from Cole Knaflic,

18
00:00:42.675 --> 00:00:46.730
"Our tools do not know the
story we aim to tell".

19
00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.320
How do we go about
deciding on a chart type?

20
00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.420
Ideally, we want our
visualizations to

21
00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.135
convey the information
at an unconscious level,

22
00:00:55.135 --> 00:00:56.860
allowing our audience to extract

23
00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.500
the information with
minimal conscious effort.

24
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.900
To achieve this, we
need to consider

25
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.405
how people actually
process information.

26
00:01:04.405 --> 00:01:08.155
For example, take The
Cafe Wall Illusion.

27
00:01:08.155 --> 00:01:11.310
In this image, the lines are
all horizontal and vertical,

28
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.615
but part of our visual
processing system

29
00:01:13.615 --> 00:01:15.715
tells us that the
lines must be sloping,

30
00:01:15.715 --> 00:01:16.960
even though the cognitive part of

31
00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.780
our brain tells us
that they're not.

32
00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.530
We don't have all the answers,

33
00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.920
but a well-known study by
Cleveland and McGill suggests

34
00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.670
a ranking for how accurately

35
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.965
people read different
visual cues.

36
00:01:27.965 --> 00:01:31.340
This suggests that we more
readily interpret length and

37
00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.945
position than volume
and intensity.

38
00:01:34.945 --> 00:01:37.290
That's almost suggesting
we should only

39
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.690
use bar and line charts.

40
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.360
Very often the old
staples are the best,

41
00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.990
but this is just one set
of factors to consider.

42
00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.985
Before we create
our visualization,

43
00:01:46.985 --> 00:01:49.000
we need to establish its purpose.

44
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.155
We can do this by asking
three simple questions;

45
00:01:52.155 --> 00:01:54.135
Why am I creating this chart?

46
00:01:54.135 --> 00:01:57.215
Who is it for? What does
it need to tell them?

47
00:01:57.215 --> 00:01:59.570
The answers to these
questions should

48
00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.690
dictate the charting
choices we make.

49
00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.095
To help our learners,

50
00:02:03.095 --> 00:02:06.955
we've included a great summary
n this week's toolbox.

51
00:02:06.955 --> 00:02:10.265
Now interesting with the
Cleveland and McGill's study,

52
00:02:10.265 --> 00:02:12.665
the rank of our perception of

53
00:02:12.665 --> 00:02:16.350
angles is higher than
I would have expected.

54
00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.000
There has been quite a lot of

55
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.615
anti-pie sentiment
in latter years,

56
00:02:20.615 --> 00:02:22.460
like Stephen Few's article,

57
00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.610
"Save the pies for dessert".

58
00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.380
We suggest that pie charts are

59
00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.410
not a particularly
effective visualization.

60
00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.860
Should we be using pie charts?

61
00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.520
As with anything, it comes
down to using it well.

62
00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.505
Pies are often used badly,

63
00:02:37.505 --> 00:02:40.900
but their native simplicity
is visually engaging.

64
00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.265
Provided the data sets are small,

65
00:02:43.265 --> 00:02:45.110
they can very effectively

66
00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.164
demonstrate a sense
of proportion.

67
00:02:47.164 --> 00:02:49.145
We are going to
look at pie charts

68
00:02:49.145 --> 00:02:51.800
and the newer sexy
doughnut chart,

69
00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.765
which does the same thing,

70
00:02:53.765 --> 00:02:55.910
but it looks a bit more
modern and it does

71
00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.360
offer us some very interesting
design opportunities.

72
00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.040
I suppose the type of
data we are trying to

73
00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.065
represent will also have

74
00:03:03.065 --> 00:03:05.510
a large bearing on
our choice of chart.

75
00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.380
For example, if we wanted
to show change over time,

76
00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.215
a good option would be
to use a line chart.

77
00:03:12.215 --> 00:03:14.750
Absolutely. We're going
to look at how to create

78
00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.790
some visually compelling
line charts as well as

79
00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.310
area charts and
stacked area charts,

80
00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.070
which allows to show
cumulative change over time.

81
00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:23.570
What about where we want to

82
00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.945
explore relationships
in our data?

83
00:03:25.945 --> 00:03:29.600
I want to see not just
sales figures over time,

84
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.280
but also the number of hits on

85
00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.440
the website for the
same time frames,

86
00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.330
to see if there's a correlation.

87
00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.385
For that type of data,

88
00:03:37.385 --> 00:03:39.995
scatter plots and
bubble charts are ideal

89
00:03:39.995 --> 00:03:41.510
and that's what we'll be focusing

90
00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.510
on in the last video this week.

91
00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.605
Another five fantastic
videos this week,

92
00:03:46.605 --> 00:03:48.479
looking at charting techniques,

93
00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:51.254
Pies and Doughnuts, Line Charts,

94
00:03:51.254 --> 00:03:55.050
Area Charts, and our
Scatter and Bubble Charts.

95
00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:56.970
Don't forget to
download the workbook,

96
00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.370
so you can work alone.

97
00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.470
The practice challenge
is to cement

98
00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.365
those skills before tackling
the assessment task,

99
00:04:03.365 --> 00:04:08.490
which will assess topics
from Week 1 and Week 2.
