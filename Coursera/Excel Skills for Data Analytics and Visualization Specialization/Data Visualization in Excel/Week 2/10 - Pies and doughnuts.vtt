00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:09.572
In this video, we're going to look at
how we can create some very creative

2
00:00:09.572 --> 00:00:13.240
visualizations using pie charts and
doughnut chart.

3
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.330
In the first example,
Roman would like to show how in 2017 half

4
00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.056
the world's emissions came
from just three countries, and

5
00:00:21.056 --> 00:00:25.236
we're going to start by selecting
our data, so that's A3 to B7.

6
00:00:25.236 --> 00:00:31.290
And we're going to come up to our Insert
tab, and we're going to choose Pie chart.

7
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:37.562
I'm just going to go for a 2D Pie chart,
and the first thing to do is move that

8
00:00:37.562 --> 00:00:42.693
over a little bit, and resize slightly,
so it fits nicely under the data.

9
00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.116
Now, while we can take a pretty
good guess at these segments,

10
00:00:50.116 --> 00:00:52.392
it's useful to have the percentages.

11
00:00:52.392 --> 00:00:56.564
And a quick way of adding them is to
come up to your chart design ribbon,

12
00:00:56.564 --> 00:01:00.413
come to Quick Layout, and
these give you some instant presets.

13
00:01:00.413 --> 00:01:03.899
And we're going to go for
the first one, layout 1,

14
00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.030
which gives us both these series
labels and the percentages.

15
00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.738
Now, if you want to format these,
just click on any one of the labels,

16
00:01:13.738 --> 00:01:18.036
they all highlight, and
then you can come, and make them white,

17
00:01:18.036 --> 00:01:21.030
change the size,
make them bold if you like.

18
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.697
And then we're just going to make one
final little tweak here, we're going to

19
00:01:26.697 --> 00:01:31.650
turn off our chart title, and
we're going to replace it with an image.

20
00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.350
So make sure your charts is still
selected, come to Insert pictures and

21
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.190
navigate to wear your workbook are and
insert the CO2 image.

22
00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.982
We'll resize that slightly and just pop
it into the middle of our chat, and

23
00:01:47.982 --> 00:01:50.810
there's a nice way of presenting our data.

24
00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.458
Now, one thing to take into account
is that all of these countries

25
00:01:56.458 --> 00:01:59.639
actually have extremely large populations.

26
00:01:59.639 --> 00:02:04.528
But one limitation of a pie chart is
you can only show a single series,

27
00:02:04.528 --> 00:02:08.341
so you can't show the population
data on this chart.

28
00:02:08.341 --> 00:02:12.987
Fortunately, we have a new type of
chart called the doughnut chart,

29
00:02:12.987 --> 00:02:17.726
which is very much like a pie, but
it will let us show multiple series.

30
00:02:17.726 --> 00:02:20.746
So we're going to copy our pie,
so Crtl + C and

31
00:02:20.746 --> 00:02:24.238
click into the cell next door,
and Crtl + V to paste.

32
00:02:24.238 --> 00:02:27.076
We'll get rid of our image for
this one, and

33
00:02:27.076 --> 00:02:31.450
then we're going to come to our
chart design, come to Chart Type and

34
00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.660
weren't going to switch that
over to a doughnut chart.

35
00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:41.520
So similar concept, but we have a hole in
the middle and we can add multiple series.

36
00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:47.129
So coming up to our data, we're going to
grab that blue square bottom right corner,

37
00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:51.400
and just drag across, and
we can now see our population as well.

38
00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.530
Look a little messy though, so
let's do a bit of a clean up.

39
00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.387
First thing we're going to do is we're
going to click on the labels in the outer

40
00:03:00.387 --> 00:03:03.420
ring, and
we're just going to switch those off.

41
00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.736
And then we're going to click on
our labels in the inner ring, and

42
00:03:06.736 --> 00:03:09.670
we're going to come to our label options.

43
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.407
And we're going to switch
off the percentage, and

44
00:03:12.407 --> 00:03:14.390
we don't need leader lines either.

45
00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.887
And then if we just select one of the
rings, it doesn't matter which one, and

46
00:03:19.887 --> 00:03:24.477
come to Format Data Series, you'll see
you can actually change the whole size,

47
00:03:24.477 --> 00:03:26.630
we can make that 25%.

48
00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.800
And that gives us a little
bit more breathing space.

49
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.256
So looking pretty good, but
I'd like to make the outer ring look

50
00:03:33.256 --> 00:03:38.410
slightly different, and one way we can do
this is by adjusting the color slightly.

51
00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.747
So I'm going to click again
into one of the segments,

52
00:03:41.747 --> 00:03:46.567
such as that one segment is selected,
come to my format data point label, and

53
00:03:46.567 --> 00:03:49.730
I'm going to set that to Solid Fill.

54
00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.466
Now that may change the colour, so we're
just going to set that back to our light

55
00:03:54.466 --> 00:03:59.240
green, and then we're going to
change our transparency to 35%.

56
00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:03.280
So it's still the same shade, but
it's just a little bit lighter.

57
00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.010
Then we're going to do that for
the darker green as well.

58
00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.147
But if you use your F4 keyboard shortcut,
you'll see as a slightly quicker

59
00:04:12.147 --> 00:04:16.720
way of applying the changes and
then just switch it over to dark green.

60
00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:21.707
Click on your Yellow F4
like that yellow and

61
00:04:21.707 --> 00:04:26.017
then the same with the Orange,
F4 and set that to orange.

62
00:04:26.017 --> 00:04:30.316
Now the only sort of downside
is it's not that easy to label

63
00:04:30.316 --> 00:04:33.250
the actual rings themselves.

64
00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:38.700
You can use category labels, but
an easier way is just to use text boxes.

65
00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:44.530
So I've gotten pre prepared over here and
I'm going to copy, click into my chart,

66
00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:50.340
and paste them, and then just move
that somewhere into the outer ring.

67
00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.140
And then I'll do the same
with the emissions, copy,

68
00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:59.301
clicking my chart, Ctrl+V to paste,
and pop that into the inner ring.

69
00:04:59.301 --> 00:05:03.401
And the reason we copy pasted
rather than just dragging them

70
00:05:03.401 --> 00:05:08.880
is when I move the chart,
you will see the text boxes move with it.

71
00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.572
So that's one way where we could represent
two sets of data, but in a pie format.

72
00:05:13.572 --> 00:05:17.300
I'll leave you to decide if
that's the most effective option.

73
00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:22.929
But the reason I wanted to introduce you
to this multiple ring option is it does

74
00:05:22.929 --> 00:05:27.614
open up a lot of creative options for
creating really effective visualizations.

75
00:05:27.614 --> 00:05:31.800
And the next one we're going to
look at is called a tracker.

76
00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.315
Now actually pre prepared
a tracker over here, so

77
00:05:35.315 --> 00:05:39.011
I'm just going to click on that shape and
delete it.

78
00:05:39.011 --> 00:05:43.510
So this tracker is showing us that
there's been a 22% improvement

79
00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:47.477
in energy efficiency for
the USA from 2005 to 2015.

80
00:05:47.477 --> 00:05:52.455
And to prepare this data, Roman has
calculators, the improvement, and

81
00:05:52.455 --> 00:05:54.713
then his calculated the offset.

82
00:05:54.713 --> 00:05:57.088
How much it has improved by?

83
00:05:57.088 --> 00:05:59.819
By just taking 1 minus the improvement.

84
00:05:59.819 --> 00:06:04.069
And these are the values we're
going to use in our tracker,

85
00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:06.961
and we can now build a tracker for China.

86
00:06:06.961 --> 00:06:11.021
Now the first thing we're going to
do is build a series that forms this

87
00:06:11.021 --> 00:06:12.995
little gray backdrop feel like.

88
00:06:12.995 --> 00:06:17.599
And if you scroll across to column S,
you'll see we actually have 60 ones that I

89
00:06:17.599 --> 00:06:23.510
prepared earlier, that's all there in that
column, and we're going to select them.

90
00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:29.116
So click S2, Ctrl+wShift+Down+Arrow and
we're going to come to our Insert,

91
00:06:29.116 --> 00:06:33.773
come to our Charts, choose pie,
and then select the doughnut chat.

92
00:06:33.773 --> 00:06:39.032
And we're going to need to move
this up a little bit, okay?

93
00:06:39.032 --> 00:06:46.431
Now the first thing we're going to need to
do is turn off our title and our legend.

94
00:06:46.431 --> 00:06:50.406
So let's get rid of both of those,
and then we can resize that so

95
00:06:50.406 --> 00:06:53.710
it fits nicely in the space
above the other tracker.

96
00:06:57.485 --> 00:07:02.510
Now clicking into our series, we're
going to change our whole size again,

97
00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:05.940
this time, I'm going to set it to 50%.

98
00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:11.022
And then we're going to come to our Fill
Color and we're going to say Solid Fill,

99
00:07:11.022 --> 00:07:14.410
and we're going to set
the whole thing to a pale gray.

100
00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:19.630
So that's created the backdrop.

101
00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:24.119
Now to add the improvement,
we're going to add another series.

102
00:07:24.119 --> 00:07:28.808
So we're going to come to Select Data,
we're going to click Add,

103
00:07:28.808 --> 00:07:32.430
our series name is going
to be our selected region.

104
00:07:36.232 --> 00:07:41.212
And our series values are going to be
our improvement and our offset, and

105
00:07:41.212 --> 00:07:45.270
then we're going to say, OK, and OK again.

106
00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:48.355
The problem is it's showing
as concentric rings, but

107
00:07:48.355 --> 00:07:52.310
we know how to solve this
problem from the last video.

108
00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:57.072
Clicking on one of the rings, were going
to come to change Chart Type, and then

109
00:07:57.072 --> 00:08:01.640
we're going to put that on a secondary
axis, and we're going to say, OK.

110
00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:06.661
And that overlays the first
series with the second series.

111
00:08:06.661 --> 00:08:10.215
And largest a couple of little tweaks,
click once, and

112
00:08:10.215 --> 00:08:14.990
then twice on your percentage improvement,
and turn on your Data Labels.

113
00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:18.592
I think will make those white as well.

114
00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:29.240
And then click on your offset once and
twice to make sure it's selected,

115
00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:33.520
come to your Fill options and
set that to No fill.

116
00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:38.152
Finally, to get our chart title,
we're going to use the text box again.

117
00:08:38.152 --> 00:08:42.226
So I'm just going to say Insert,
come to Shapes,

118
00:08:42.226 --> 00:08:46.300
choose the textbox,
a nice textbox to go in here.

119
00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:52.237
And then we're going to come into
our formula bar, type equals,

120
00:08:52.237 --> 00:08:56.960
and click on our region name,
and then percentile.

121
00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:01.563
And then probably a good idea just to set
that vertically and horizontally, and

122
00:09:01.563 --> 00:09:04.386
maybe just adjust the size
slightly down to a 9.

123
00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:16.966
And now we can straightaway see that
the energy improvement for China was 54%.

124
00:09:16.966 --> 00:09:20.980
Not only that, but
these trackers are completely dynamic.

125
00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:27.246
So if I come and change my year for
example to 2007, you see it adjust,

126
00:09:27.246 --> 00:09:31.910
and if I change my location to Cyrus,
it also adjusts.

127
00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:35.847
It's really effective visualizations and

128
00:09:35.847 --> 00:09:38.159
nice, creative way of
presenting your data.

129
00:09:38.159 --> 00:09:38.659
[SOUND]
