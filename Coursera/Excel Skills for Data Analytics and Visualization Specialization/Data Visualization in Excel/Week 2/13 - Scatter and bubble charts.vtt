1
00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:08.460
In this video, we're going to
look at how we can explore

2
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.200
correlations in our data

3
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.065
using scatter charts
and bubble charts.

4
00:00:13.065 --> 00:00:14.970
Rohan has a suspicion that

5
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:16.560
there is a relationship between

6
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.070
a country's per capital
GDP and their emissions,

7
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.515
and he'd like to
explore that visually.

8
00:00:22.515 --> 00:00:25.020
Now we have the per capita GDP,

9
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.170
and the per capita
emissions data.

10
00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:28.880
What we're going to do,

11
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.990
is show that data
on a scatter chart.

12
00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.260
Usually when create a column
chart or a line chart,

13
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.800
we only provide a numeric
value for the y-axis.

14
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.985
The x-axis just has text
labels or a year label.

15
00:00:43.985 --> 00:00:45.740
But in this situation,

16
00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.905
we actually want a
numeric value for both.

17
00:00:48.905 --> 00:00:51.050
We are going to
start by selecting

18
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.900
two columns with numeric data in,

19
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.490
and that's going to be our
GDP and our emissions.

20
00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.650
What Excel will do is use

21
00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.845
the first column that you
select as your x-axis,

22
00:01:03.845 --> 00:01:07.630
and the second column that
you select as your y-axis.

23
00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.545
But obviously you can
swap these around.

24
00:01:10.545 --> 00:01:12.780
I'm going to press
"Control", "Shift",

25
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.265
"Down Arrow" and then
just scrolling up,

26
00:01:16.265 --> 00:01:20.275
I'm going to come to my
Insert Tab on my ribbon.

27
00:01:20.275 --> 00:01:22.710
I'm going to come to charts,

28
00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.180
and we're going to look for

29
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.820
the Insert Scatter
or Bubble Chart.

30
00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.360
Then to begin with,

31
00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.010
we just going to start with

32
00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.490
a straightforward scattershot and

33
00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.580
I want to make that
a fair bit bigger.

34
00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.600
You can see Rohan's suspicions
are largely correct.

35
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.100
We can definitely see

36
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.775
an upward trajectory
as our GDP increases,

37
00:01:46.775 --> 00:01:49.240
so do our emissions.

38
00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.800
We can pretty easily spot these

39
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.180
are the GDP per capita values,

40
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.389
because they're the big numbers.

41
00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:59.555
But for somebody coming
new into this chart,

42
00:01:59.555 --> 00:02:03.820
it would be very helpful if
we had labels on our axes.

43
00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.360
Let's do that.

44
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.300
We're going to come to
our Chart Elements.

45
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.135
We're going to turn
Axis Titles on,

46
00:02:11.135 --> 00:02:13.975
and then we just come
and edit the title.

47
00:02:13.975 --> 00:02:17.025
I'm going to triple-click
on the first one,

48
00:02:17.025 --> 00:02:19.600
and that's our Emissions.

49
00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.680
Then I'm going to triple-click in

50
00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.370
my horizontal axis and
that's my GDP per capita.

51
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.675
While I'm at it, I'll
give my chart a label.

52
00:02:37.675 --> 00:02:40.540
I'm going to triple-click
up there as well,

53
00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:46.490
and this is going to be GDP
per capita versus emissions.

54
00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.725
Now one of the downsides is
that with a scatter chart,

55
00:02:50.725 --> 00:02:54.580
we don't automatically get
labels for our data points.

56
00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.815
But in the newer
versions of Excel,

57
00:02:56.815 --> 00:02:59.945
you can actually add those
labels if you want to.

58
00:02:59.945 --> 00:03:02.145
We've got quite a
lot of data here,

59
00:03:02.145 --> 00:03:04.010
so it's going to look very messy,

60
00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.625
but I'd like you to
see how to do it.

61
00:03:06.625 --> 00:03:09.955
Again, we're going to come
to our Chart Elements.

62
00:03:09.955 --> 00:03:13.370
I'm going to turn
our Data Labels on,

63
00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.810
but it's used the
emissions values

64
00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.865
which is not what we want.

65
00:03:17.865 --> 00:03:19.700
If you come to your panel

66
00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.860
and if you don't see
your panel there,

67
00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.840
just click the
black arrow outside

68
00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.850
Data Labels and choose "More

69
00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.190
Options" and that will bring you

70
00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.215
into your options for
your Data Labels.

71
00:03:31.215 --> 00:03:34.965
I'm going to click "Text
Options", "Label Options",

72
00:03:34.965 --> 00:03:37.550
un-select "y-Value" and we're

73
00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.250
going to get a value
from cells instead.

74
00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:41.780
Now we can just click on

75
00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.910
our first country
and press "Control",

76
00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.280
"Shift", "Down Arrow" and "Okay".

77
00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.935
Page up a couple of times,

78
00:03:49.935 --> 00:03:54.785
and you can see it has actually
added the country names.

79
00:03:54.785 --> 00:03:56.270
As I said though, we have

80
00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:00.535
so many countries that it's
getting messy in here.

81
00:04:00.535 --> 00:04:03.200
But if you just need
a sneak peek or

82
00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.525
if you had a lot less data,

83
00:04:05.525 --> 00:04:07.850
it is really handy to know.

84
00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:09.890
All right, we're
actually going to

85
00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:12.110
switch those labels off.

86
00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:14.510
Now another piece
of data that Rohan

87
00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.730
would like to show on this chart,

88
00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:19.805
is the population for
each of these countries.

89
00:04:19.805 --> 00:04:24.520
A scatter plot can only
represent an X and a Y value.

90
00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.750
But there's a newer chart
called a bubble chart,

91
00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.510
which should also allow

92
00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.644
you to represent
a third variable,

93
00:04:32.644 --> 00:04:36.085
and it shows that
as the bubble size.

94
00:04:36.085 --> 00:04:39.050
The smaller values
get small bubbles,

95
00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:41.410
and the larger values
get large bubbles.

96
00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.435
That's what we can do
with our population data.

97
00:04:45.435 --> 00:04:47.635
With your chart selected,

98
00:04:47.635 --> 00:04:50.870
we are going to come
to Change Chart Type

99
00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.190
and we're going to choose
a nice 3-D Bubble,

100
00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.380
but you could choose
either 2D or 3D,

101
00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.580
and we're going to say, "Okay".

102
00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.230
Now at the moment, it
looks very strange

103
00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:05.530
because all of our bubbles
are the same size.

104
00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.080
So we need now to tell Excel

105
00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.385
where to get the third
set of values from.

106
00:05:11.385 --> 00:05:15.665
We're going to do that by
coming to Select Data.

107
00:05:15.665 --> 00:05:19.695
You'll see we have a single
series at the moment.

108
00:05:19.695 --> 00:05:22.069
We're going to edit that series,

109
00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:23.920
and the bubble size has been

110
00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.469
set to one for all the bubbles,

111
00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:30.260
so we're just going to
remove that information.

112
00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:34.620
Instead, we are going to
select our population.

113
00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.505
So click "D4" and control
shift down arrow,

114
00:05:38.505 --> 00:05:40.710
and then click "OK"

115
00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:44.355
and "OK." Page up a
couple of times again,

116
00:05:44.355 --> 00:05:46.740
and that's looking much better.

117
00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.605
But these two massive
bubbles over here,

118
00:05:49.605 --> 00:05:52.125
which I think we can
guess are China and

119
00:05:52.125 --> 00:05:55.260
India, are dominating everything.

120
00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.299
We have another option,

121
00:05:57.299 --> 00:06:00.270
and that is to scale our bubbles.

122
00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:03.510
Just select one bubble,
doesn't matter which,

123
00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:07.890
come to Format Data Series
and choose your options.

124
00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:10.650
Then we're going to
scale our bubble to

125
00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:14.835
50 percent of its original
size and press "Enter".

126
00:06:14.835 --> 00:06:19.395
That's obviously made our
chart a lot easier to read.

127
00:06:19.395 --> 00:06:21.780
Now, we need a few more tweaks.

128
00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:23.790
Let's look at Qatar over here.

129
00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:25.770
It's a bit of an extreme value.

130
00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:28.455
In fact, you'll only
see two countries,

131
00:06:28.455 --> 00:06:30.975
Norway and Qatar, actually have

132
00:06:30.975 --> 00:06:34.215
a GDP per capita of over 80,000.

133
00:06:34.215 --> 00:06:37.260
We are going to change
our axis so we can get

134
00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.680
a better view of the
majority of the data.

135
00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:43.635
Select your horizontal axis,

136
00:06:43.635 --> 00:06:46.380
come to your axis options,

137
00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:48.480
and we're going to
make that go from

138
00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:51.300
zero because we don't
need a negative.

139
00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:54.930
Then we're just going to remove
the one in front of that,

140
00:06:54.930 --> 00:07:00.195
80,000, and that's made the
data already more readable.

141
00:07:00.195 --> 00:07:04.710
Then we're going to do something
similar for our y-axis.

142
00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:08.400
We'll start that at
minus one to give space

143
00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:12.299
for our bubbles and
then take that to 31,

144
00:07:12.299 --> 00:07:14.865
which will let Trinidad
and Tobago fit in.

145
00:07:14.865 --> 00:07:18.450
But scale the axis so
it's a little better.

146
00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:22.950
We can now see our data
much more clearly.

147
00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:25.560
Now, an ethics note here,

148
00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:28.800
you should put a note under
your graph that you've

149
00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:32.595
removed Norway and Qatar
by adjusting the axis,

150
00:07:32.595 --> 00:07:34.560
because we don't
want to pretend that

151
00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.170
those two values don't exist.

152
00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:40.425
Let's make one final
tweak to this.

153
00:07:40.425 --> 00:07:44.040
We're going to come up to
our chart designs and we're

154
00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:45.720
going to choose an option that

155
00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:48.415
makes our bubbles
that much clearer.

156
00:07:48.415 --> 00:07:50.090
So have a look at these with

157
00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:51.875
your bubble charts in particular,

158
00:07:51.875 --> 00:07:55.860
as some of them will highlight
the bubbles much better.

159
00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:58.415
That's looking really good.

160
00:07:58.415 --> 00:08:00.500
But without the chart labels,

161
00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:02.905
[inaudible] had another idea.

162
00:08:02.905 --> 00:08:06.060
He would like to call
the bubbles by region.

163
00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:09.615
Now at the moment, this is
just one single series.

164
00:08:09.615 --> 00:08:11.370
So you'd have to use all sorts of

165
00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:13.110
tedious procedures to try and

166
00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:15.045
recall each bubble manually,

167
00:08:15.045 --> 00:08:17.295
which is not going to
be very efficient.

168
00:08:17.295 --> 00:08:18.810
But what you can do with

169
00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:21.015
both scatter and bubble charts

170
00:08:21.015 --> 00:08:23.520
is you can add multiple series.

171
00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:26.955
If you add each region
as its own series,

172
00:08:26.955 --> 00:08:28.890
then you can color-code them.

173
00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:31.845
So what [inaudible] has done
to the right over here,

174
00:08:31.845 --> 00:08:34.440
is actually prepared
the region data

175
00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:36.540
in five separate blocks.

176
00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:40.470
He's actually already created
the bubble chart over here.

177
00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:42.870
What he did was he started by

178
00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:45.435
creating the bubble
chart just for Africa,

179
00:08:45.435 --> 00:08:47.400
and then he's gone and manually

180
00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:49.740
added each of the other blocks.

181
00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:52.065
There's just one
more left to add,

182
00:08:52.065 --> 00:08:53.670
and that's euro, and we're

183
00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:55.365
going to look at how to do that.

184
00:08:55.365 --> 00:09:00.520
Select your chart, come
up to select data,

185
00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:03.660
you'll see that there
are four series

186
00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:05.340
that have been added so far.

187
00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:10.930
We're going to click" Add" and
we're going to add Europe.

188
00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:14.535
Our X values are our GDP,

189
00:09:14.535 --> 00:09:16.665
so we're just going
to select that.

190
00:09:16.665 --> 00:09:19.050
Our Y values, and just

191
00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:21.825
be careful to remove
what's already there.

192
00:09:21.825 --> 00:09:26.325
Our emissions and
our bubble size is

193
00:09:26.325 --> 00:09:32.295
our population, and click "OK".

194
00:09:32.295 --> 00:09:34.800
Now, you'll notice
that Europe has now

195
00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:37.080
been added as a red series.

196
00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:39.015
One final little tweak.

197
00:09:39.015 --> 00:09:41.670
Africa is pale green
and you'll see

198
00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:44.280
as being hidden by
the Asian countries,

199
00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:46.125
which are so large here.

200
00:09:46.125 --> 00:09:47.700
The way it works is

201
00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:50.445
the most recently added
series goes on top,

202
00:09:50.445 --> 00:09:52.650
but you can re-sequence them.

203
00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:55.290
So I'm going to click
on "Africa" and

204
00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:58.095
just click the down
arrow to move it down.

205
00:09:58.095 --> 00:10:01.215
Now Africa is coming
on top of Asia,

206
00:10:01.215 --> 00:10:04.125
and we can see it a
little bit more clearly.

207
00:10:04.125 --> 00:10:06.090
I'm going to click "OK".

208
00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:09.434
Brilliant. Come back
into our chart,

209
00:10:09.434 --> 00:10:11.880
and let's just add a legend,

210
00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:15.720
and I'm going to put that
at the bottom of the chart.

211
00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:19.710
Now we have a completed
bubble charts.

212
00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:23.310
So scatter and bubble
chart's excellent for

213
00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:27.310
showing correlations between
values in your data.
