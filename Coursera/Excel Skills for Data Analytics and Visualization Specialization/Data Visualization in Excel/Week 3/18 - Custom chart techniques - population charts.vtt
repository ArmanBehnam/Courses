00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.100
In this video, we're going
to look at how we can create

2
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.930
our own custom charts using

3
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:13.005
a few sophisticated
formatting techniques.

4
00:00:13.005 --> 00:00:16.320
Why would we need a custom
chart given how many

5
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.935
fantastic chart options Excel
now makes available to us.

6
00:00:19.935 --> 00:00:22.680
It's possible that you won't
have the latest version,

7
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.900
so you might not have
all those chart types.

8
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.595
It's also possible that

9
00:00:26.595 --> 00:00:29.280
your data might need
something a bit different,

10
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.950
or it might be just
that you want to grab

11
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.780
your audience's attention by

12
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.490
presenting something that
looks a bit different.

13
00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:38.780
For whatever reason you may find

14
00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.000
you need to create your
own custom charts,

15
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.290
and what we're going
to do is look at

16
00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.110
some techniques that
will help you do that.

17
00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.390
In this example, Rowan

18
00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.820
wants to create a
visualization that will

19
00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.160
demonstrate how the population in

20
00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.690
the UK has aged over
the last 24 years.

21
00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.730
What he wants is a
funnel style chart,

22
00:00:58.730 --> 00:00:59.750
but he wants to show

23
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.720
the female data on the
left and the male data on

24
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.700
the right and
Excel's funnel chart

25
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.545
doesn't give us that option.

26
00:01:07.545 --> 00:01:11.015
We're going to create
a custom chart using

27
00:01:11.015 --> 00:01:12.635
a standard bar chart

28
00:01:12.635 --> 00:01:15.035
and it's going to look
something like this.

29
00:01:15.035 --> 00:01:17.110
Now, I'm going to
get rid of that.

30
00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.270
Rowan has already done
some some preparation.

31
00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.145
Just using a SUMIFS function,

32
00:01:24.145 --> 00:01:29.390
he's summarized the percentage
male and female data

33
00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.485
for each age group for
the year selected in I3.

34
00:01:33.485 --> 00:01:35.480
We can actually come and change

35
00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.330
the year and you'll
see the data updates.

36
00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.570
Now, there's one more
thing we need to

37
00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.310
do before we create the chart.

38
00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.009
We need to make all the
female values negative

39
00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:47.240
because we actually want them to

40
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.340
show the left of the y-axis.

41
00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.040
Now the correct thing to do
would be to come on here,

42
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.390
double-click and just pop

43
00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.750
a minus in there at the
front of the formula.

44
00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.830
But I'd actually like to show you

45
00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.930
quite a neat little option if you

46
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.815
actually have to work off
the original dataset.

47
00:02:02.815 --> 00:02:05.770
We need to convert all
these values to negative.

48
00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.480
In other words, we need to
multiply them by minus one.

49
00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:10.310
I'm going to pop minus one into

50
00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.590
G2 and then I'm going
to press Control Enter,

51
00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:13.790
which is like pressing Enter,

52
00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.200
but I stay in the cell.

53
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.230
Then going to copy,
Control C and I'm

54
00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.125
going to select the data
I want to make negative,

55
00:02:21.125 --> 00:02:23.110
Control Shift down arrow.

56
00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.630
I'm now going to come to

57
00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.440
my home tab and I'm
going to find the paste.

58
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.790
I'm going to click the drop-down,

59
00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.590
and I'm going to
choose Paste Special.

60
00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.240
One of the special
options is you can apply

61
00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.470
an operation and we
want to multiply.

62
00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.240
I then click Okay and all
my values are now negative,

63
00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.370
really neat little option.

64
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.590
Let's go and create our chart.

65
00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:52.690
I'm going to select the
data from L3 down to N23,

66
00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.290
then I'm going to come to Insert,

67
00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.380
I'm going to come
to my chart group,

68
00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:58.970
find my column chart and I'm just

69
00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.885
going for a 2D Bar chart.

70
00:03:01.885 --> 00:03:05.359
Let's now move that into
place so it's covering

71
00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:09.990
the data and just make
it a little bit bigger.

72
00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.735
A few problems.

73
00:03:12.735 --> 00:03:16.250
First of all, the bars
are not lining up,

74
00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.320
which is normal behavior,

75
00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.225
but not what we want.

76
00:03:20.225 --> 00:03:21.755
With our chart selected

77
00:03:21.755 --> 00:03:23.900
keyboard shortcut
Control One to open

78
00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.315
a bar formatting panel and

79
00:03:26.315 --> 00:03:29.855
click onto one of the series,
doesn't matter which one.

80
00:03:29.855 --> 00:03:33.265
Then we're going to come
to our Series Options,

81
00:03:33.265 --> 00:03:35.220
and what we want to
do here is change

82
00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.045
our series overlap
to be 100 percent.

83
00:03:39.045 --> 00:03:41.970
You can see now they're
lining up beautifully.

84
00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.950
The gap width are quite wide,

85
00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.615
which is making my bars narrow,

86
00:03:45.615 --> 00:03:47.280
if I change that to be

87
00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.420
50 percent you'll see my
bars get a little fatter.

88
00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.540
Much better, but we still have

89
00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.495
a fairly large problem
with our vertical axis.

90
00:03:56.495 --> 00:04:00.110
Because these values
are actually negative,

91
00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:03.050
the axis labels are lining
up next to the axis,

92
00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:05.545
which is again normal
but not what we want.

93
00:04:05.545 --> 00:04:08.780
We're going to click
onto our vertical axis,

94
00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.835
and then in our
panel on the right,

95
00:04:10.835 --> 00:04:12.110
we're going to choose

96
00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:14.780
Axis Options and this

97
00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.550
is quite a well hidden
little feature.

98
00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:21.020
But if you come down to
Labels and Label Position,

99
00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:24.660
you can choose to position
them low and that moves

100
00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.235
them to the left
of the data point

101
00:04:26.235 --> 00:04:28.305
rather than right
next to the axis.

102
00:04:28.305 --> 00:04:30.860
That's looking much
better. We also

103
00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.310
need to make a few tweaks
to our horizontal axis,

104
00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.345
I'm going to click
on to that next.

105
00:04:35.345 --> 00:04:37.820
We actually need to
lock the minimum and

106
00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.730
maximum because otherwise
as the values change,

107
00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.225
the axis could change and
will look a little strange.

108
00:04:44.225 --> 00:04:46.040
We are going to come into

109
00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.215
our minimum and
make that minus 10,

110
00:04:48.215 --> 00:04:52.120
and then I'm going to press
Tab twice and make that 10.

111
00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.410
Same values, but now
they're going to

112
00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:56.945
stay fixed rather than adjusting.

113
00:04:56.945 --> 00:04:58.940
Then one more thing,

114
00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.830
although these are
negative values,

115
00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.580
we don't want them to
show as negatives.

116
00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.970
Remember our custom
number formatting,

117
00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:07.470
we looked at week 1?

118
00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.590
That's about to come
in handy again,

119
00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:10.635
I'm going to scroll down to

120
00:05:10.635 --> 00:05:14.660
number and at the moment it's
applying a general format,

121
00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:18.340
but we need our own format
so let's says format code.

122
00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.260
Just remove the general and we

123
00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.329
want it to be zero if
it's positive semicolon,

124
00:05:24.329 --> 00:05:27.190
zero if it's negative semicolon,

125
00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.065
and zero if it's zero.

126
00:05:29.065 --> 00:05:33.110
Now if you click Add x is fixed.

127
00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.810
Why? That's the main
formats we want to change.

128
00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.555
I'm just going to
close that panel now.

129
00:05:39.555 --> 00:05:41.660
But there are couple
of other tweaks.

130
00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.160
We don't want our grid lines, I'm

131
00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.860
going to switch those off.

132
00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:49.325
But more importantly, we
need a good chart title.

133
00:05:49.325 --> 00:05:51.410
Only our chart title is actually

134
00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:53.540
going to change
depending on our year

135
00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:54.710
because we need to see this as

136
00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:58.525
the UK population data for
whichever year we've selected.

137
00:05:58.525 --> 00:06:01.100
I'm going to move this down
a little and we're going to

138
00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.190
create a really
simple formula in P3.

139
00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:06.020
I'm going to type equals,

140
00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:07.610
I'm going to open
my double-quotes,

141
00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:08.930
because I'm putting in text,

142
00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:15.195
and I'm going to put UK
population and space.

143
00:06:15.195 --> 00:06:17.805
Then I'm going to close
my quotes for my text.

144
00:06:17.805 --> 00:06:20.420
Now, I need to join
it to the year.

145
00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:22.625
The official term is concatenate,

146
00:06:22.625 --> 00:06:24.740
and I can do that
using an ampersand.

147
00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:26.500
I'm going to type ampersand,

148
00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:31.155
click on 1997 and
then press Enter.

149
00:06:31.155 --> 00:06:35.525
Now, all I need to do is click
back onto my chart title,

150
00:06:35.525 --> 00:06:37.210
make sure you've
clicked on the border,

151
00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:38.920
not inside the box.

152
00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.960
Come into my Formula Bar,

153
00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.610
type equals and
just like a shape,

154
00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:45.160
we can link it up to
the value in a cell and

155
00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.340
when I press Enter,
there's my population.

156
00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:50.560
I'm going to move the
chart back into place

157
00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.440
now and if we come
and change our years,

158
00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:57.440
if I click the drop-down
and set that back to 1996,

159
00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.580
the chart title updates.

160
00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:02.260
Your chart title can also be

161
00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.320
linked to a cell and you can
make it a bit more dynamic.

162
00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:07.510
If we now go through the chart,

163
00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:10.030
you see at the moment, 1996,

164
00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:14.825
our biggest population
was in the early '30s.

165
00:07:14.825 --> 00:07:18.530
If I click the drop-down
and change it to 2003,

166
00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:21.125
you'll see it's gone
up to the late '30s.

167
00:07:21.125 --> 00:07:24.955
If I now jump forward
in time to 2019,

168
00:07:24.955 --> 00:07:26.720
our biggest population band

169
00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.280
is actually in the early '50s.

170
00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.530
We can see that the population

171
00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:32.780
has aged over the last 24 years,

172
00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:34.070
but having to come
and click these

173
00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:35.390
drop-downs is not great.

174
00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:40.365
The last step we'd like to
do is animate the chart.

175
00:07:40.365 --> 00:07:42.195
You may recall in week 1,

176
00:07:42.195 --> 00:07:44.400
we looked at a way of
recording a macro to do

177
00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:47.570
that animation and you could
absolutely do that here.

178
00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:49.220
All you need to do is come in and

179
00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:51.610
record yourself clicking
through each year.

180
00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:53.870
Not the most efficient though

181
00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:56.015
I'm just moving these over here.

182
00:07:56.015 --> 00:07:58.040
Actually, I've given
you another macros,

183
00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:59.870
it's already written for
you just so you can see

184
00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:02.600
an alternative. Let's
have a quick look at it.

185
00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:04.950
I'm going to press Alt F11

186
00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:09.975
and this has brought
me into my VBA Editor

187
00:08:09.975 --> 00:08:13.050
and here's our macro,
it's called ChartAnimate.

188
00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:15.200
Instead of going through and

189
00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:18.125
changing the year
one step at a time,

190
00:08:18.125 --> 00:08:20.950
we've used a for-loop.

191
00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:24.975
What the for-loop
will do is it will,

192
00:08:24.975 --> 00:08:27.050
it's like a little
space in memory,

193
00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:29.540
it's called a variable
and it contain a value.

194
00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:31.955
It'll we'll start with
the value 1996 and

195
00:08:31.955 --> 00:08:35.095
then each time we loop through
it will add one to it.

196
00:08:35.095 --> 00:08:38.240
Then this line of code will
take whatever value is

197
00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:42.035
sitting in that count
and pop it into I3.

198
00:08:42.035 --> 00:08:44.690
It's literally going to loop
through changing the value

199
00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:48.220
until it hits 2019 and then
it's going to drop out.

200
00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:51.390
There's an alternative,
you can copy paste code.

201
00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:52.790
You now know how or if you

202
00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:54.635
want to record yourself
doing the macro,

203
00:08:54.635 --> 00:08:56.875
give it a go with will
work just as well.

204
00:08:56.875 --> 00:08:58.340
Then here this, you could

205
00:08:58.340 --> 00:08:59.735
definitely record
yourself doing this.

206
00:08:59.735 --> 00:09:03.515
This is to reset the
value in I3 back to 1996.

207
00:09:03.515 --> 00:09:05.420
I'm going to close
that up, let's go

208
00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:06.890
and hook up our macros.

209
00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:09.430
I'm going to
right-click on Animate,

210
00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:12.180
assign Macro, and we're going to

211
00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:14.520
choose Chart Animate and Okay.

212
00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:16.890
Then the same thing for
the reset right-click,

213
00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:19.785
assign Macro and this
time Chart Reset,

214
00:09:19.785 --> 00:09:22.790
and Okay. Click
away for a moment.

215
00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:24.245
I'm going to click Animate,

216
00:09:24.245 --> 00:09:26.270
and you can actually see
it scrolling through

217
00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:29.630
the years and how the population
is changing over time.

218
00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:33.800
If I click Reset it
sets it back to 1996.

219
00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:35.810
What we've looked at here are

220
00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:38.480
a few really interesting
techniques for creating

221
00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:40.910
your own custom charts to add

222
00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:44.790
that wow factor to
your visualizations.
