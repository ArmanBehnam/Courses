00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.720
In this video,
we're going to look

2
00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.070
at Excel's hierarchy charts.

3
00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:11.800
Hierarchy charts are

4
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.140
an excellent visualization
for representing

5
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.720
hierarchical data or data that's

6
00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.630
been subdivided
into subcategories.

7
00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.100
So for example, with

8
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.530
Rowan's greenhouse
gas emission data,

9
00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:25.600
he's actually divided it into

10
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.495
the top 10 countries and
the other countries.

11
00:00:28.495 --> 00:00:31.090
He wants to be able
to see proportionally

12
00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.805
how many emissions come from
just the top 10 emitters.

13
00:00:34.805 --> 00:00:36.630
He's then divided the top 10

14
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.190
into the countries themselves,

15
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.865
and within each country,

16
00:00:39.865 --> 00:00:42.870
the sectors that are
producing the most emissions.

17
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.770
This is what we call
hierarchical data,

18
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.365
and we now have two
stunning chart types

19
00:00:48.365 --> 00:00:50.125
for representing this data.

20
00:00:50.125 --> 00:00:52.730
Before we create them, it
is quite important that

21
00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.160
your data is
structured correctly.

22
00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.465
So you must have your main
category in your first column,

23
00:00:59.465 --> 00:01:03.530
your next category in
the second column, etc.

24
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.690
The last column must
contain a numeric value.

25
00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.800
Now, if I scroll down to

26
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.320
my other countries,
my non-top 10,

27
00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.060
you'll see these
have not been broken

28
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.400
down by sector, and that's fine.

29
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.140
You don't need the same number

30
00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.090
of subcategories in each case,

31
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.070
but you must make sure again that

32
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.255
the numeric data ends
up in that last column.

33
00:01:25.255 --> 00:01:27.000
Our data's all good.

34
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.685
Let's now create our chart.

35
00:01:28.685 --> 00:01:31.040
So clicking anywhere in the data,

36
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.865
we're going to come
to our Insert tab.

37
00:01:33.865 --> 00:01:35.745
In the Charts group,

38
00:01:35.745 --> 00:01:39.905
we're going to come to the
Insert Hierarchy Chart icon,

39
00:01:39.905 --> 00:01:41.620
and click the drop-down.

40
00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.070
Two to choose from,
the first one we're

41
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.350
going to go for is the sunburst.

42
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.870
So select "Sunburst"
and then let's

43
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.150
make this nice and big

44
00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.680
because we've got
quite a lot of data.

45
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.575
There's our visually
stunning sunburst chart.

46
00:01:59.575 --> 00:02:01.610
Very easy to understand.

47
00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.740
The innermost ring shows us

48
00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.310
the breakdown of top 10
versus the other countries.

49
00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.530
Then the next ring is

50
00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.675
the actual top 10
countries themselves,

51
00:02:11.675 --> 00:02:15.020
and finally, the
individual sectors.

52
00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.900
Let's make a few
changes to this chart.

53
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.400
So I'm going to come to the green

54
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.680
plus to get my chart elements,

55
00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.960
and I'm going to
untick "Chart Title".

56
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.350
Instead, I'm going to use

57
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:28.880
the shape that I created earlier,

58
00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:29.975
so I'm going to click on it,

59
00:02:29.975 --> 00:02:31.655
"Control X" to cut,

60
00:02:31.655 --> 00:02:34.610
click into my chart, and
"Control V" to paste.

61
00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:35.900
I'm just going to position that

62
00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.320
somewhere near the middle,

63
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.460
and you can resize it
slightly if you need to.

64
00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.250
You'll notice the data
labels automatically

65
00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.295
display where they will fit.

66
00:02:46.295 --> 00:02:48.230
If we make them slightly smaller,

67
00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.800
we can fit a few more labels.

68
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.685
So I'm going to click on
to one of my data labels,

69
00:02:52.685 --> 00:02:54.470
come up to my "Home" tab,

70
00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.600
and I'm going to change
the size to seven.

71
00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.340
I'm just going to click
in the box and type

72
00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.260
seven and press "Enter".

73
00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.745
They're still readable, but
I can now fit a few more.

74
00:03:03.745 --> 00:03:06.420
The other change I could
make which will help

75
00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.110
visibility is the borders.

76
00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.165
The lines here are very thick.

77
00:03:11.165 --> 00:03:12.470
So to change that,

78
00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.735
we're going to click
somewhere into the chart.

79
00:03:14.735 --> 00:03:16.700
I'm then going to right-click

80
00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.935
and choose "Format Data Series".

81
00:03:18.935 --> 00:03:21.350
This will open my
panel on the right,

82
00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.030
and I'm going to
click into my "Paint

83
00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.450
Bucket" and come
down to "Border".

84
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.975
What we want to
change is our width.

85
00:03:27.975 --> 00:03:29.645
If you click the drop-down,

86
00:03:29.645 --> 00:03:31.100
it will actually go
straight to zero,

87
00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.085
which is a little smaller
than I had in mind.

88
00:03:33.085 --> 00:03:38.010
So we're going to change that
to 0.2 and press "Enter".

89
00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.235
If you click away for a moment,

90
00:03:40.235 --> 00:03:43.890
you'll see we get much thin
and more elegant lines.

91
00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.890
Now, because we only
had the two series,

92
00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:50.435
we've only got two colors,

93
00:03:50.435 --> 00:03:51.860
and I'd like a little more,

94
00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.600
which again is easy to do.

95
00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.010
So I'm going to start, again,

96
00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:56.615
by clicking into my series

97
00:03:56.615 --> 00:03:58.130
and then I'm going to click on to

98
00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.685
"Other" to highlight
just the other series.

99
00:04:02.685 --> 00:04:04.760
Then I'm going to come
to my color fill;

100
00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.190
I'm going to make that
a nice light gray.

101
00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.315
Then click into your top 10.

102
00:04:10.315 --> 00:04:13.900
We're going to make this
a slightly darker gray.

103
00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:18.710
Now, what I'd like to do is give

104
00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:20.990
my top five emitters
each their own color.

105
00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:22.370
So I'm going to start
by clicking into

106
00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.695
"China", and I'll make that blue.

107
00:04:24.695 --> 00:04:26.930
Then I'm going to
repeat that process for

108
00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.810
my other four top emitters.

109
00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.830
There is our completed
Sunburst chart.

110
00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.455
Let's now have a look at
how we create a tree-map.

111
00:04:42.455 --> 00:04:46.495
So we're going to click into
the next tab in our chart.

112
00:04:46.495 --> 00:04:49.060
You'll see this data
is very similar,

113
00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.455
except we only have
the two categories.

114
00:04:51.455 --> 00:04:54.155
Also notice, with the
primary category,

115
00:04:54.155 --> 00:04:57.450
that it actually has been
repeated. Now, that's fine.

116
00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:58.935
It will work really nicely,

117
00:04:58.935 --> 00:05:00.470
but here we have to be a little

118
00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:02.630
careful about our sort order.

119
00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.700
It's really important that

120
00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.385
the data is sorted
by main category.

121
00:05:07.385 --> 00:05:09.170
In other words, if I came into

122
00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:12.455
"Country" and I resorted my data,

123
00:05:12.455 --> 00:05:14.630
that is not going to work.

124
00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.515
So just make sure that you
are sorted by main category.

125
00:05:18.515 --> 00:05:20.560
I'm going to undo that change.

126
00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.470
Now, with your data selected,

127
00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:23.775
so you can just be clicked in it,

128
00:05:23.775 --> 00:05:26.355
we're going to come
into our Insert tab.

129
00:05:26.355 --> 00:05:28.680
We're going to come to Charts,

130
00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.810
and this time we're going
to choose "Treemap".

131
00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:35.190
Again, let's make
that nice and big.

132
00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:41.155
So tree-map, very similar
concept to our sunburst.

133
00:05:41.155 --> 00:05:46.355
You can clearly see the
breakdown showing which of

134
00:05:46.355 --> 00:05:48.350
our regions are emitting

135
00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:50.510
the most and which
countries within

136
00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:53.750
those regions make
up those emissions.

137
00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:55.790
So for example, Africa is

138
00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:58.430
producing comparatively
little in the way of CO_2.

139
00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.250
But South Africa on its
own is probably making

140
00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:04.510
up for about a third of
those total emissions.

141
00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:06.560
Now, we can easily
add some formatting

142
00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:07.970
to this chart as well.

143
00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:10.970
This time, I'm going to come
to my Chart Design ribbon.

144
00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:13.069
Let's add some styling.

145
00:06:13.069 --> 00:06:16.505
So I'm just going to
select "Style 7",

146
00:06:16.505 --> 00:06:19.520
which gives me a bit
of a gradient color.

147
00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:23.300
To change the colors, we have
our five series this time,

148
00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.190
so we don't need
to get as manual.

149
00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:27.615
We can just come to our
Change Color option

150
00:06:27.615 --> 00:06:30.835
and choose another color set.

151
00:06:30.835 --> 00:06:34.615
Finally, we should give
this a proper chart title.

152
00:06:34.615 --> 00:06:36.370
So I'm going to click into

153
00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:39.550
my chart title and then
"Control A" to select all,

154
00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:48.740
and I'm going to type CO_2
emissions by country 2017.

155
00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:53.070
But you'll notice the two
doesn't look quite right.

156
00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:55.150
That really should
be a subscript,

157
00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:56.665
and you can do it in Excel;

158
00:06:56.665 --> 00:06:58.180
it's just a little
harder to find.

159
00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:00.370
So I'm going to
highlight just the two.

160
00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:02.585
I'm going to come to my Home tab.

161
00:07:02.585 --> 00:07:05.580
At the bottom corner
of the Font group,

162
00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:07.605
you can open your Font Settings.

163
00:07:07.605 --> 00:07:10.170
The keyboard shortcut
is "Control 1".

164
00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:15.459
We're going to choose
"Subscript" and then say "Okay",

165
00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:18.180
and that's looking great.

166
00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:21.470
So two chart types we've
looked at for representing

167
00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:26.305
hierarchical data are
sunburst and our tree-map.

168
00:07:26.305 --> 00:07:28.805
These chart types are
only available in

169
00:07:28.805 --> 00:07:31.025
Excel 2016 and later.

170
00:07:31.025 --> 00:07:33.140
But in this week's
practice challenge,

171
00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:34.310
we're going to show you an

172
00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:35.960
alternative method for creating

173
00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:40.050
a hierarchy chart using
Excel's doughnut chart.
