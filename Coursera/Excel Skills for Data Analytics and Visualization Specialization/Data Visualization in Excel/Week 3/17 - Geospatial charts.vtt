00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.370
In this video, we're going
to look at how we can use

2
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.560
Excel's map charts to compare

3
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.935
values across different
geo-spatial regions.

4
00:00:13.935 --> 00:00:15.600
To create a map chart,

5
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.180
you must have some
geographical data.

6
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.010
Countries work really well.

7
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.200
States, provinces, regions can

8
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.780
also work depending on the
country you're working with.

9
00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.890
Rowan has a dataset showing

10
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.580
the varying biocapacities
for different countries.

11
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.480
He'd like to be able to
compare these on a world map.

12
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.570
He's going to do this
using a map chart.

13
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.330
Let's start by
selecting our data.

14
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.670
I'm going to select B3 and

15
00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.545
C3 and then press Control
Shift Down arrow,

16
00:00:48.545 --> 00:00:50.480
and then scroll up again or

17
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.350
our chart will be created
halfway down the sheet.

18
00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.565
Now we're going to come
to our Insert tab,

19
00:00:56.565 --> 00:00:58.295
and in the charts group,

20
00:00:58.295 --> 00:01:00.140
we're going to look for maps.

21
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.620
You will need Office 2019 or

22
00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.240
Microsoft 365 to
get this feature.

23
00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.210
When we click Maps,
you'll see there's

24
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.980
a filled map and we're going
to click on it to apply.

25
00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.380
If there is a problem
and it doesn't

26
00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.570
recognize your geographical data,

27
00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.840
you will get an error bar
at the top explaining that,

28
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.220
but our own data's absolutely

29
00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.100
fine and that's looking great.

30
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.550
Let's make a few
important changes though.

31
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.880
In a moment, we're actually
going to filter the data to

32
00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.450
allow us to zoom in on
specific areas in the chart.

33
00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.670
But if I were to hide some rows,

34
00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:38.850
I'll just quickly demonstrate.

35
00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.160
I'm going to select some rows and

36
00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.720
I'm going to right-click and

37
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.420
hide and the chart
immediately minimizes.

38
00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.870
We need to be a little
careful if we don't want

39
00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:55.055
our chart to resize when we
change or hide our cells,

40
00:01:55.055 --> 00:01:56.600
we need to specify that.

41
00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:57.845
Let's stop there.

42
00:01:57.845 --> 00:02:00.290
I'm going to click on
to my chart and control

43
00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.105
one or just double-click to
open your panel on the right.

44
00:02:04.105 --> 00:02:06.260
We're going to click on

45
00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.005
our chart options and

46
00:02:09.005 --> 00:02:11.525
just expand properties
if you need to.

47
00:02:11.525 --> 00:02:15.115
You have a choice to move
and size with cells,

48
00:02:15.115 --> 00:02:19.095
move but don't size with
cells or don't move or size.

49
00:02:19.095 --> 00:02:22.570
It's that third option
we want in this case.

50
00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.680
We can also change the way

51
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.050
the actual map
projection is shown.

52
00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.335
I'm going to click
somewhere into the data

53
00:02:30.335 --> 00:02:32.240
itself and we're going to

54
00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.984
start by looking at
our Series Options.

55
00:02:34.984 --> 00:02:37.550
This is our automatic
map projection,

56
00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.049
but there are different styles

57
00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:40.520
of map you can choose from.

58
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.510
Have a look through. I
particularly like the Miller one.

59
00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.815
You can also choose
what map area you see.

60
00:02:48.815 --> 00:02:51.140
By default, it will show

61
00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.570
you all the regions
covered in your data.

62
00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.925
If I only had regions in the US,

63
00:02:55.925 --> 00:02:58.250
it will only show me
regions in the US.

64
00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.580
You'll notice that where there
is no data for the region,

65
00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.265
it is grayed out.

66
00:03:03.265 --> 00:03:05.790
There are two other
options, however.

67
00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.970
I can show only
regions with data,

68
00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.400
and what that will do is

69
00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.290
hide all the regions
that don't have data.

70
00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:13.820
You can see those
grayed out areas have

71
00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.710
disappeared as has
a little piece of

72
00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:17.150
Africa and a little piece of

73
00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.050
South America because we don't
have data for those areas.

74
00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.750
The last option is World,

75
00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.210
and that will always show
the whole world map,

76
00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:29.050
regardless of which
areas have data.

77
00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.910
Now for ours, we actually
want to force it to

78
00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.310
zoom in on particular areas as

79
00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.590
we filter and for that
we're going to need to

80
00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.880
use only regions with data.

81
00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.340
You can also specify that
you want Map Labels.

82
00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:44.840
If I click Show All,

83
00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.380
it tries to squeeze
them all in but

84
00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.470
a lot of them are not
fitting properly.

85
00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.735
So I would actually recommend
going for Best Fit Only.

86
00:03:52.735 --> 00:03:56.375
Then we can also change
our series color.

87
00:03:56.375 --> 00:03:58.100
This is biocapacity, so I

88
00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.490
think shades of green
might be better.

89
00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:04.445
It does it on a sliding scale
or gradient if you like.

90
00:04:04.445 --> 00:04:06.650
We need to specify
our lowest value.

91
00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.155
I am going to go for
quite a pale green.

92
00:04:09.155 --> 00:04:11.030
Then my highest value,

93
00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.450
I'm going to go for
a more vivid green,

94
00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.845
just makes the map look
a bit more exciting.

95
00:04:16.845 --> 00:04:19.940
That's everything I wanted to
do in the formatting panel.

96
00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.415
I'm going to close that up.

97
00:04:21.415 --> 00:04:23.280
A couple more tweaks though.

98
00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.495
Let's move our legend to
the bottom of the chart.

99
00:04:26.495 --> 00:04:28.880
I'm just going to
come to Legend and

100
00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.200
specify bottom and let's give it

101
00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.420
a proper chart title I'm
just going to triple

102
00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:37.090
click in there and
type biocapacity,

103
00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.855
and that map chart
is looking great.

104
00:04:41.855 --> 00:04:44.000
But now we get to
the exciting bit,

105
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.250
being able to zoom in on

106
00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.435
particular areas of the data
by filtering our chart.

107
00:04:50.435 --> 00:04:52.580
Now I'm going to
actually just move

108
00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:53.900
the chart over a little bit to

109
00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.020
the right to give me some space.

110
00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.915
We're going to actually create
something called a slicer,

111
00:04:59.915 --> 00:05:03.545
which is a very intuitive
way of filtering data.

112
00:05:03.545 --> 00:05:06.140
But in order to use the slicer,

113
00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:09.110
I need to have a table
or a pivot table.

114
00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.510
Now we had a look at tables
in the previous course,

115
00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:13.055
but here's a quick reminder.

116
00:05:13.055 --> 00:05:14.995
I'm going to click into my data.

117
00:05:14.995 --> 00:05:17.150
I'm going to come to Insert

118
00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.720
and I'm going to choose Table.

119
00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.420
It automatically
identifies the table data

120
00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:26.780
provided that your first
row contains your headings.

121
00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:28.975
You can just say, Okay.

122
00:05:28.975 --> 00:05:32.520
Now it has added some
funky formatting.

123
00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.145
If you don't like that,

124
00:05:34.145 --> 00:05:35.945
you'll see in the table ribbon,

125
00:05:35.945 --> 00:05:38.120
you can switch it off
altogether or you

126
00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.350
can go for something
more to your taste.

127
00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:46.145
But more importantly,
having added our table,

128
00:05:46.145 --> 00:05:48.500
on the table design ribbon,

129
00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:52.210
you will see an option
to insert a slicer,

130
00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:53.925
and that's what we really want.

131
00:05:53.925 --> 00:05:55.965
I'm going to click Insert Slicer.

132
00:05:55.965 --> 00:05:57.815
You can have as many slices

133
00:05:57.815 --> 00:05:59.990
as you have columns or fields.

134
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:02.330
We want to filter
by region though.

135
00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.650
I'm going to take
region and say, Okay.

136
00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:08.380
Now it's popped my
slicer onto my sheet.

137
00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:10.940
I can move that across
just by dragging it

138
00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:13.440
and you can re-size using
the resize handles,

139
00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.065
so I'll make that a
little bit smaller

140
00:06:15.065 --> 00:06:17.330
and you can format it as well.

141
00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.010
With your slices selected,

142
00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:21.715
you get a slicer ribbon
and a gallery of

143
00:06:21.715 --> 00:06:23.160
slicer styles similar to

144
00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.810
our table. I'm going
to go for the blue.

145
00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:28.140
That's creating the slicer.

146
00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:30.775
Lets see how easy it
is to now work with.

147
00:06:30.775 --> 00:06:33.405
I'm going to click
on to Americas.

148
00:06:33.405 --> 00:06:36.650
It has filtered the data
to only show countries in

149
00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:38.570
the Americas and by filtering

150
00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:41.395
the data, I filter my chart.

151
00:06:41.395 --> 00:06:45.180
There's Asia, there's Europe.

152
00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:47.810
If I want to just get
back to my whole world,

153
00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:52.690
I come to the top right hand
corner and clear the filter.

154
00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:56.240
Three really simple
steps to creating

155
00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.555
a totally interactive
geo-spatial visualization.

156
00:06:59.555 --> 00:07:03.275
Start by inserting a map chart,

157
00:07:03.275 --> 00:07:05.585
convert your data to a table,

158
00:07:05.585 --> 00:07:08.850
and then insert a slicer.
