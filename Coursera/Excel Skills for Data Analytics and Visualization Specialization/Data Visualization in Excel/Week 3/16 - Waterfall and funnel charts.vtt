00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:06.960
In this video, we're
going to look at

2
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.360
two quite specialized
chart types called

3
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.495
the waterfall chart
and the funnel chart.

4
00:00:12.495 --> 00:00:14.670
Let's start with the
waterfall chart.

5
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.860
Waterfall charts are
often used to show

6
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.290
financial data because
they allow us to

7
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.810
visualize how a series
of increases and

8
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.705
decreases got us
to a final figure.

9
00:00:24.705 --> 00:00:26.340
They look very similar to

10
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.715
column charts except
that each increase,

11
00:00:29.715 --> 00:00:31.575
let's say our revenues,

12
00:00:31.575 --> 00:00:33.495
are shown as a step up,

13
00:00:33.495 --> 00:00:36.510
each decrease, for
example our costs,

14
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.430
are shown as a step down,

15
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.665
and only the totals are
shown as a height from zero.

16
00:00:43.665 --> 00:00:47.060
In this example, Brian
actually wants to use

17
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.820
a waterfall chart to
show how the increases

18
00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.195
and decreases in population
in the various member states

19
00:00:53.195 --> 00:00:57.580
have led to our overall
population change within the EU.

20
00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.390
This data is what we
call categorical.

21
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.340
It doesn't really matter
the sequence as long as

22
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:10.045
the final population change
is shown in the last row.

23
00:01:10.045 --> 00:01:11.540
Bear in mind, of course, that if

24
00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:12.740
we change the sort order,

25
00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.885
the look of the
chart will change.

26
00:01:14.885 --> 00:01:17.870
If you are working
with time series data,

27
00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.060
so transactions over time,

28
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.830
then it is important
that your data is

29
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.200
sequenced oldest to newest.

30
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.230
To create the chart, we're
going to click into our data,

31
00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.300
we're going to come
to our "Insert" tab,

32
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.460
we're going to come to
the charts group and

33
00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.315
we're going to look for
the "Waterfall" icon.

34
00:01:34.315 --> 00:01:37.410
Right at the top you'll
see "Waterfall" and

35
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.140
we're going to click on
that to create our chart.

36
00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.510
I'm just going to make
that a bit bigger

37
00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.920
so we can see it more clearly.

38
00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.760
If you have a look
a little closely,

39
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.470
you'll notice each increase
is shown as a blue step-up,

40
00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.220
each decrease in population is

41
00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.290
shown as an orange step down,

42
00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.600
but there's one small problem,

43
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.940
our final population total

44
00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.150
is actually being
shown as an increase.

45
00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.505
Creating a waterfall
chart involves two steps.

46
00:02:07.505 --> 00:02:09.245
First, we create the chart.

47
00:02:09.245 --> 00:02:12.080
Second, we have to
identify the totals,

48
00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.275
this is not done for
us automatically.

49
00:02:14.275 --> 00:02:16.070
To do this, I'm
going to click once

50
00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:17.540
to highlight the whole series

51
00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.960
and then I'm going to click
again on the actual total.

52
00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.165
Then I'm going to right-click,

53
00:02:23.165 --> 00:02:27.500
and right near the bottom
you'll see Set as Total.

54
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.960
What you'll need to
do is apply that

55
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.010
for each of the
totals in your chart.

56
00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.400
You might not just have
a total at the end,

57
00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.810
you might have an
opening balance,

58
00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.940
you might have interim totals,

59
00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.500
so you can have as many
totals as you need,

60
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.095
you just need to remember
to set them as total.

61
00:02:44.095 --> 00:02:46.515
So we're most of the way there.

62
00:02:46.515 --> 00:02:48.795
Let's make a few final changes.

63
00:02:48.795 --> 00:02:50.770
We have the data labels
and they make it

64
00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.600
very clear what's happening.

65
00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.040
So we actually don't
need the gridlines.

66
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.730
I'm going to click into my chart,

67
00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.050
come to "Chart Elements",

68
00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.670
I'm going to turn the "Gridlines"

69
00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.555
off and in fact the axes,

70
00:03:04.555 --> 00:03:08.095
I don't need my primary
vertical axis either.

71
00:03:08.095 --> 00:03:10.790
I do, however, need a more
meaningful chart titles,

72
00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:11.950
so I'm just going to click into

73
00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.050
the heading and I'm
going to copy all of

74
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.590
that and then I'm going
to come into chart title,

75
00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.840
triple click and paste.

76
00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.090
Then there's my completed
waterfall chart.

77
00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.630
Let's now have a look
at a funnel chart.

78
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.945
I'm going to the next
tab in my workbook,

79
00:03:28.945 --> 00:03:31.490
and I've actually got
the funnel chart we're

80
00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:32.660
going to create so you get

81
00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.240
an idea of where we're heading.

82
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.280
Now funnel chart is
another specialized chart,

83
00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.810
but it's very well suited to

84
00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.625
showing the progressive
reduction of

85
00:03:40.625 --> 00:03:45.005
data as data passes from
one phase to another.

86
00:03:45.005 --> 00:03:48.515
Data in each phase is
shown as a proportion

87
00:03:48.515 --> 00:03:52.085
of the original value
and as it decreases,

88
00:03:52.085 --> 00:03:55.195
we get that distinctive
funnel shape.

89
00:03:55.195 --> 00:03:58.459
Funnel charts are typically
used for representing

90
00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:02.865
a sales pipeline but they
do have other applications.

91
00:04:02.865 --> 00:04:05.210
In this case, no
one is going to use

92
00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:08.150
a funnel chart to represent
what proportion of

93
00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.370
plastics produced
in a year end up in

94
00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.140
the oceans and the process
they go through to get there.

95
00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.505
I'm just going to
remove this chart,

96
00:04:16.505 --> 00:04:18.630
I'm going to delete, and

97
00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.700
then I'm going to
click into my data.

98
00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.100
Here the sort order
is quite important.

99
00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.890
You want to have
the first phase of

100
00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:26.690
the top going through to

101
00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.000
the last phase at the
bottom and typically that

102
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.810
should go from the largest
value to the lowest.

103
00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.855
Now we're going to
click in our data,

104
00:04:33.855 --> 00:04:35.625
come to our "Insert" tab,

105
00:04:35.625 --> 00:04:37.460
we're going to come
back to our waterfall

106
00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.440
chart icon but we're going to

107
00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.775
choose "Funnel" this
time, and there it is.

108
00:04:43.775 --> 00:04:48.650
Too easy. There are not
a lot of changes you

109
00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.615
can make to the funnel chart

110
00:04:50.615 --> 00:04:53.240
and the colors for example
we only have the one series,

111
00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.285
so you're going to be
locked into one color,

112
00:04:55.285 --> 00:04:57.620
but we can make it look a
little more interesting.

113
00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.270
I'm going to turn off

114
00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.160
the title because I'm just
going to use the title in

115
00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.610
the workbook and then I'm
going to format my series.

116
00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.610
To do this, I'm just going
to click onto one of

117
00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:09.650
the series and driven
by a keyboard shortcut,

118
00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:13.525
Control 1, and that opens
our panel on the right.

119
00:05:13.525 --> 00:05:16.740
Then I'm going to come
to my Series Options,

120
00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.560
my Fill, and I'm going
to change my Fill.

121
00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:20.940
But instead of a color,

122
00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.240
I'm actually going
to use a picture.

123
00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.690
Now when you click onto
"Picture or texture fill",

124
00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:28.805
if you haven't used this before,

125
00:05:28.805 --> 00:05:33.110
you will probably get something
that looks like that,

126
00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:34.290
which is pretty horrible,

127
00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:36.230
but we're going to replace
that with the picture.

128
00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:37.640
So under "Picture source",

129
00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.970
can you please click "Insert"
and "Online images",

130
00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:43.100
unless you have a nice
image on your computer.

131
00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:45.480
We're going to look for pics of

132
00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.120
the ocean and we're making

133
00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.010
sure that Creative
Commons is ticked,

134
00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:50.855
but it's still worth checking

135
00:05:50.855 --> 00:05:52.580
the licensing so you don't use

136
00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:54.715
somebody's picture
without their permission.

137
00:05:54.715 --> 00:05:57.300
I'm going to find a nice
picture of the ocean,

138
00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.130
and then I'm going
to click "Insert".

139
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:04.020
There's our completed
funnel chart.

140
00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.545
If you have a slightly
older version of Excel,

141
00:06:06.545 --> 00:06:08.930
you might not have
these chart types yet,

142
00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:11.120
but don't worry, later this week,

143
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.670
we're going to show you how
you can create a chart very

144
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:16.970
similar to a funnel chart
using a standard bar chart,

145
00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:18.950
and in the practice challenge,

146
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:21.620
we actually give you an
example of how you can

147
00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.865
create a waterfall chart
using a column chart.

148
00:06:24.865 --> 00:06:28.620
Don't forget to check out this
week's practice challenge.
