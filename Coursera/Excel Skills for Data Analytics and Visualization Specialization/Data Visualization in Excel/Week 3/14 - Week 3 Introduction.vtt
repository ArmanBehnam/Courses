1
00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:05.190
Last week, we focused on creating

2
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.350
the more conventional
chart types and

3
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.600
techniques involved in modifying

4
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.495
them to tell exactly
the story we wanted.

5
00:00:12.495 --> 00:00:14.415
Now, I understand that

6
00:00:14.415 --> 00:00:17.040
often the standard charts
are the best choice,

7
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.990
but presumably there are times

8
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.780
where we would use a
less conventional chat.

9
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.750
Absolutely. Sometimes we may have

10
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.880
a more specific
requirement or we may

11
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.340
just need to grab our
audience's attention.

12
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.175
So this week, we're going
to look at some of the new,

13
00:00:32.175 --> 00:00:33.690
more specialized
charts that has been

14
00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.805
included in the newer
versions of Excel,

15
00:00:35.805 --> 00:00:37.110
and we're also going to look at

16
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.090
some creative charting
techniques for

17
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.590
creating our own
specialized charts.

18
00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:43.430
It is important we cover some

19
00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.305
of these exciting new features.

20
00:00:45.305 --> 00:00:47.120
But what about for
our learners who

21
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.890
have older versions of Excel?

22
00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.510
Yeah, they may find that

23
00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.280
some of the chart
types we'll look at,

24
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.230
are not available to them yet.

25
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.005
But I still encourage
them to watch the videos

26
00:00:57.005 --> 00:00:58.250
and in one of the videos

27
00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.260
this week and in the
practice challenge,

28
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.730
we will actually show them

29
00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.050
some great work-arounds for

30
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.545
creating nearly all of
the charts we look at.

31
00:01:05.545 --> 00:01:07.010
That's great, Nikki.

32
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.095
So what are we starting
with this week?

33
00:01:09.095 --> 00:01:10.640
Well, first up we're
going to look at

34
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.785
sunburst and treemap charts,

35
00:01:12.785 --> 00:01:15.335
these are examples
of hierarchy charts,

36
00:01:15.335 --> 00:01:17.330
and they're excellent for

37
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.135
depicting hierarchical
breakdowns.

38
00:01:20.135 --> 00:01:22.970
So for example, I
might use them to show

39
00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.910
sales volume by a
branch within region.

40
00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.495
Great example and then
after hierarchy chart,

41
00:01:29.495 --> 00:01:31.385
we're going to have a
look at waterfall charts.

42
00:01:31.385 --> 00:01:32.660
These are typically used for

43
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:37.220
financial data because
they allow us to show how,

44
00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.385
when we add and subtract
values from initial balance,

45
00:01:40.385 --> 00:01:42.650
how we get to our final total.

46
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.260
Then we're going to have
a look at funnel charts.

47
00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.315
I see quite a lot
of funnel charts.

48
00:01:47.315 --> 00:01:49.909
Easy to spot as there
are a funnel shape,

49
00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.070
and usually used to
show the amount of

50
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.840
potential revenue for each
stage in the process.

51
00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.260
Yeah, that's right.
They're quite new in

52
00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.365
Excel and a little bit basic,

53
00:02:00.365 --> 00:02:02.455
but they're very easy to use.

54
00:02:02.455 --> 00:02:03.890
Then after that, we're going to

55
00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.300
look at probably my favorite,

56
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.890
which are map charts.

57
00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.295
Provided with a valid
geographical dataset,

58
00:02:10.295 --> 00:02:13.550
they can actually
compare values on a map.

59
00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:14.770
Just brilliant.

60
00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.075
Now, when you say
geographical data,

61
00:02:17.075 --> 00:02:18.875
do you mean the coordinates?

62
00:02:18.875 --> 00:02:21.315
No. It can just be county,

63
00:02:21.315 --> 00:02:24.320
state, country, or
city, data is fine.

64
00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.780
But sometimes it helps
to qualify the data.

65
00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.615
So if I were doing UK
counties for example,

66
00:02:29.615 --> 00:02:32.000
I would also include
a column detailing if

67
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.730
they were in England,
Scotland, for example.

68
00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.010
Fantastic that Excel
is making all of

69
00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.380
these new chart types
available to us.

70
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.320
But coming back to something
you said in the first week,

71
00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.320
can excel animate our charts?

72
00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.665
Well, it's not built-in yet.

73
00:02:47.665 --> 00:02:50.305
But with a simple macro, yes,

74
00:02:50.305 --> 00:02:51.830
and that's exactly what we'll be

75
00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.210
looking at in the fourth video.

76
00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:55.790
Even with all these
new chart types,

77
00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.950
there may still be
visualizations we

78
00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.815
want to create that
aren't available yet.

79
00:03:00.815 --> 00:03:03.890
Yeah, that's true, but this
is what I love most about

80
00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.865
Excel because it gives us
so much creative control.

81
00:03:07.865 --> 00:03:09.380
With a little imagination,

82
00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:10.475
we can actually create

83
00:03:10.475 --> 00:03:13.010
our own amazing visualizations
and we're going

84
00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.150
to look at a great example of

85
00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.835
this in our last video this week.

86
00:03:16.835 --> 00:03:19.250
So lots of exciting
content this week

87
00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.725
looking at hierarchy, waterfall,

88
00:03:21.725 --> 00:03:23.600
funnel, and map charts,

89
00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.055
as well as creating and
animating our own custom charts.

90
00:03:28.055 --> 00:03:31.475
Download those workbooks and
work along where you can.

91
00:03:31.475 --> 00:03:33.950
There's another fantastic
practice challenge

92
00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.800
and if you don't have all
the chart types discussed,

93
00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.929
it will give you some
great work-arounds

94
00:03:38.929 --> 00:03:40.100
for the hierarchy,

95
00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.485
waterfall and map charts.

96
00:03:42.485 --> 00:03:45.260
We're very excited to
see the visualizations

97
00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.050
you start creating
with your own data.

98
00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.455
So please post them in this
week's creative corner.

99
00:03:51.455 --> 00:03:53.075
No assessment this week,

100
00:03:53.075 --> 00:03:55.200
so just have fun.
