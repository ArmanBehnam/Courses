1
00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:10.560
In this video, we're going to get really
creative and create a gauge chart.

2
00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:17.235
Creativity can be quite important without
visualizations, because it helps us really

3
00:00:17.235 --> 00:00:22.910
engage our audience or tell a story and
Brono wants to do both in this scenario.

4
00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.533
He has some data here showing
different projected sea

5
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:32.090
level rises depending on how well
the world responds to global warming.

6
00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.082
So for example, in the low scenario,
if there's an immediate and

7
00:00:36.082 --> 00:00:39.662
positive response,
waters might only rise by 390 mil.

8
00:00:39.662 --> 00:00:42.772
On the other hand,
if there's very poor response,

9
00:00:42.772 --> 00:00:47.942
our most extreme scenario are sea levels
could rise by nearly 10 meters by 2200.

10
00:00:47.942 --> 00:00:50.765
Now what he wants to do is
to create gauge chart so

11
00:00:50.765 --> 00:00:53.601
that the audience can
interact with this data.

12
00:00:53.601 --> 00:00:56.247
I should probably give you
a bit of a road map so

13
00:00:56.247 --> 00:01:00.190
that you understand some of
the choices we're making.

14
00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.768
To create the gauge chart,

15
00:01:01.768 --> 00:01:06.309
we're actually going to use a combination
of a doughnut chart and a pie chart.

16
00:01:06.309 --> 00:01:10.682
We're going to start with a doughnut
chart, which has the first half broken

17
00:01:10.682 --> 00:01:15.052
into three equal segments, and then
the second half made up by one segment,

18
00:01:15.052 --> 00:01:18.800
we're then going to hide
the segment on the left.

19
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.966
And then we're going to rotate the whole
chart through to 270 degrees so

20
00:01:23.966 --> 00:01:27.920
that it looks more like a gauge or
speedometer.

21
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.989
We're then going to superimpose a pie
chart over the top of that, and

22
00:01:31.989 --> 00:01:35.777
the first segment of the pie will
be our global sea level rise.

23
00:01:35.777 --> 00:01:41.060
The second segment, our pointer, and
the third segment, the rest of the pie.

24
00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.750
We're then going to hide segment one and
three, to give us our final gauge chart.

25
00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.316
Before we can create the chart though,
setting up the data is quite important, so

26
00:01:52.316 --> 00:01:55.150
we're actually going to do this together.

27
00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.539
The first thing we need to set
up is the gauge itself, and

28
00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:00.643
this is really entirely up to you.

29
00:02:00.643 --> 00:02:02.920
I would like three equal segments, but

30
00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.900
you could decide to go for
a smaller medium and a large.

31
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.120
We then need to make sure that
the second half of the chart that we're

32
00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.452
not going to see is the same
size as these combined.

33
00:02:12.452 --> 00:02:17.170
So, I'm just going to hit an auto sum,
and there's my gauge.

34
00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.923
The pointer is made up of three sections,
as we saw,

35
00:02:21.923 --> 00:02:25.406
the first segment needs to be
our global sea level rise.

36
00:02:25.406 --> 00:02:30.317
And in your data this might be quite
straightforward, in ours there's a little

37
00:02:30.317 --> 00:02:35.098
bit of a complication because our users
can actually choose their scenario.

38
00:02:35.098 --> 00:02:38.199
So for example intermediate,

39
00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:45.030
I'll actually that on high and
they can choose their year.

40
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.630
So, we actually need to do a two way look
up to determine which value they want.

41
00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.430
And you may recall if you
did the previous course,

42
00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.440
probably the best way to do a two way
look up is using an index and a match.

43
00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.833
So clicking to Q4,
little bit of revision equals, in for

44
00:03:03.833 --> 00:03:08.301
index and then I'll look up data is
going to be all our possible values.

45
00:03:08.301 --> 00:03:10.820
So, I'm just going to highlight
all of that and type comma.

46
00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.977
Now the first thing we need to
identify is which row out of

47
00:03:15.977 --> 00:03:18.867
that data set we want
to get our value from.

48
00:03:18.867 --> 00:03:23.618
Now if we have a look high is in the fifth
row, so we need some way of finding out

49
00:03:23.618 --> 00:03:27.875
which position high is in, and
to do that we use our MATCH function.

50
00:03:27.875 --> 00:03:32.598
So, here's our MATCH and
I'm going to match the chosen scenario

51
00:03:32.598 --> 00:03:35.994
into my possible options which I've named.

52
00:03:35.994 --> 00:03:40.054
And this is an exact match,
so 0 close your bracket for

53
00:03:40.054 --> 00:03:43.880
your match, now type another comma.

54
00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.228
And we're going to need another match
to workout which column are selected

55
00:03:48.228 --> 00:03:48.949
here is in.

56
00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:54.488
So again MATCH, click on the year 2200 and

57
00:03:54.488 --> 00:03:58.748
we going to match that into our years,

58
00:03:58.748 --> 00:04:02.171
again it's an exact match.

59
00:04:02.171 --> 00:04:05.664
I'm going to close my bracket for
my second match and

60
00:04:05.664 --> 00:04:08.584
I'm going to close my bracket for
my index.

61
00:04:08.584 --> 00:04:14.371
Now let's just do a quick double check, so
for the highest scenario in the year 2200,

62
00:04:14.371 --> 00:04:17.737
I'm expecting to get back 7500 and
there it is.

63
00:04:17.737 --> 00:04:21.745
If I were to go and change my year,
for example to be at 2100,

64
00:04:21.745 --> 00:04:26.300
you can see that immediately
changes to 2000, so that's working.

65
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.830
The next segment is going to
be our pointed self and

66
00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.728
this will vary depending
on the size of your data.

67
00:04:33.728 --> 00:04:37.904
I'm going to say let's take a guess at 50,
if it ends up being much too wide or

68
00:04:37.904 --> 00:04:40.270
much too narrow, we can always adjust it.

69
00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.910
And then finally we need to make
up the rest of the pie chart.

70
00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:50.014
So, we need to decide what our maximum,
our gauge can go to, and

71
00:04:50.014 --> 00:04:54.240
we're going to keep it
simple by saying it's 9700.

72
00:04:54.240 --> 00:05:00.987
So the first half of the chart is going to
be made up by 9700 less these two values.

73
00:05:00.987 --> 00:05:06.122
And the second half of
the chart will be 9700, so

74
00:05:06.122 --> 00:05:11.491
our total third segment is
going to be equal to 9700

75
00:05:11.491 --> 00:05:17.110
times 2 less the sum of the two
segments we already have.

76
00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:20.820
And then I'm going to click Enter.

77
00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.730
So, that's how data is set up,
let's get creative.

78
00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:30.512
I'm going to select my gauge data first,
we just going to stop with the gauge and

79
00:05:30.512 --> 00:05:33.602
I'm going to come to insert,
come to my charts and

80
00:05:33.602 --> 00:05:36.054
I'm going to choose a doughnut chart.

81
00:05:36.054 --> 00:05:40.040
I don't need the legends, so
I'm just going to flick that off.

82
00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:45.556
And then I'm going to come up
to chart design format and

83
00:05:45.556 --> 00:05:47.834
we're going to make a few changes.

84
00:05:47.834 --> 00:05:50.826
I'm going to make this
about a size 16 by 16,

85
00:05:50.826 --> 00:05:55.221
I don't need it to have a shape fill,
so I'm going to set it to no fill.

86
00:05:55.221 --> 00:05:59.887
And I don't need it to have an outline,
so I'll flick that off as well and

87
00:05:59.887 --> 00:06:04.190
then I'm just going to move the chart
into place in the grey section.

88
00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:10.113
Now we can actually get into
changing the chart itself, so

89
00:06:10.113 --> 00:06:15.530
I'm going to click into the chart data and
Ctrl+1 to open up my panel.

90
00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:20.592
And here's one of the most important
things we need to do for this chart,

91
00:06:20.592 --> 00:06:23.580
we need to change the angle
of our first slice.

92
00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:28.603
We're going to make that 270 and
that's how we actually get

93
00:06:28.603 --> 00:06:33.641
that distinctive gauge look, so
a really handy little trick.

94
00:06:33.641 --> 00:06:39.611
And we're going to change our hole sizes
as well, I'm going to make that 50.

95
00:06:39.611 --> 00:06:45.121
Now, clicking into our paint bucket,
we need to turn that white line off,

96
00:06:45.121 --> 00:06:49.180
so I'm going to come to border and
say no line.

97
00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:52.519
And now we're going to recolor
the individual segments, so

98
00:06:52.519 --> 00:06:55.119
I'm going to click on
to the bottom segment.

99
00:06:55.119 --> 00:06:59.810
And I'm going to say no fill, so that's
how we effectively hide half the chart.

100
00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:04.272
Now with the other three segments,
I could just make them a solid color, but

101
00:07:04.272 --> 00:07:06.374
we're trying to do
something a bit different.

102
00:07:06.374 --> 00:07:10.570
So, I'm going to click into the first
segment and I'm going to add a gradient.

103
00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:15.710
This gradient might look different on
your system, it's whatever you used last.

104
00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:19.936
I am actually going to slide my tab
stop on the left over to the far left,

105
00:07:19.936 --> 00:07:24.905
if you have more than two you can just
click on this little remove gradient stop,

106
00:07:24.905 --> 00:07:26.870
to get rid of it.

107
00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:29.153
And there was my gradient stop selected,

108
00:07:29.153 --> 00:07:32.687
I'm going to change it to the pale
yellow from standard colors.

109
00:07:32.687 --> 00:07:35.802
I'm then going to click on to
my second gradient stop and

110
00:07:35.802 --> 00:07:38.304
I'm going to change that
to the pale orange.

111
00:07:38.304 --> 00:07:42.615
And if yours is sitting on the far right,
just pull it in a little bit, and

112
00:07:42.615 --> 00:07:45.814
now we're going to change
the angle of the gradient.

113
00:07:45.814 --> 00:07:49.371
because I actually wanted to go
from pale yellow to orange, and

114
00:07:49.371 --> 00:07:53.120
the easiest way to do that
is to come to direction.

115
00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:57.247
And find the one that looks
closest to what you want, so

116
00:07:57.247 --> 00:08:03.820
I want the yellow to the orange on
a diagonal and it's this option over here.

117
00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:09.379
That's about a 315 degree, and you can
obviously adjust this if you need to,

118
00:08:09.379 --> 00:08:12.832
and then I'm going to click
into my middle segment.

119
00:08:12.832 --> 00:08:17.816
Again gradient, but this time I'm going
to go from the pale orange just slightly

120
00:08:17.816 --> 00:08:22.600
dark orange and I'm going to pull both of
these gradients stops in a little bit.

121
00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:29.663
So, my second gradient stop, I'm going to
click more colors, come to standard and

122
00:08:29.663 --> 00:08:34.700
choose the orange third from the bottom
kind of in the middle and say OK.

123
00:08:35.810 --> 00:08:38.720
And probably for
this one a zero gradient will work nicely.

124
00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:43.891
And then finally clicking
into my last segment,

125
00:08:43.891 --> 00:08:47.260
I'm going to make this
the dark orange to red.

126
00:08:56.390 --> 00:09:01.212
And that's about a 40 degree angle,

127
00:09:01.212 --> 00:09:07.057
should work quite nicely there,
maybe a 30,

128
00:09:07.057 --> 00:09:14.520
fantastic and
there is our really nice looking gauge.

129
00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:18.093
But now we have to actually
get our pointer on to that, so

130
00:09:18.093 --> 00:09:21.143
making sure you've got
your charts selected.

131
00:09:21.143 --> 00:09:26.030
We're going to come up to chart design and
we're going to click select data.

132
00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:31.320
And we're going to add another series,
so we're going to click add and

133
00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.550
the series name is going to be Pointer.

134
00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:38.570
And this can come in handy if
you need to modify the chart.

135
00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:42.671
And the series values are going
to be our pointer values, so

136
00:09:42.671 --> 00:09:46.620
I'm just going to select those three and
say OK, OK again.

137
00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:52.241
What it's done is it's added
a second ring to our doughnut,

138
00:09:52.241 --> 00:09:57.300
which is not quite what we want,
so let's click into that ring.

139
00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:59.367
Come up to change chart type and

140
00:09:59.367 --> 00:10:04.515
we We're actually come to change
our pointer to be a pie chart.

141
00:10:04.515 --> 00:10:08.472
And then we're going to put
it on a secondary axis, and

142
00:10:08.472 --> 00:10:10.976
that's the second trick in here.

143
00:10:10.976 --> 00:10:17.770
So make it a pie chart, secondary axis,
say OK, and there's our pie chart.

144
00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:20.929
Very similar to what we had
to do with our gauge chart.

145
00:10:20.929 --> 00:10:26.690
Let's just click into the pie, first of
all, we're going to turn off the border.

146
00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:28.997
We're then going to
come to our Options and

147
00:10:28.997 --> 00:10:32.020
we're going to change the Angle
of first slice to 270.

148
00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:38.734
And now all we need to do is come
back to our paint bucket icon,

149
00:10:38.734 --> 00:10:42.690
click on our first segment and
say No fill.

150
00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:46.697
Click on our third segment and
say No fill and there's a gauge chart.

151
00:10:46.697 --> 00:10:49.483
But let's make our point
at slightly nicer colors,

152
00:10:49.483 --> 00:10:53.420
just make sure you've got a selected,
and we're going to make that black.

153
00:10:55.870 --> 00:11:01.500
We should probably give
our chart a nice title,

154
00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:06.285
so I'm going to come into chart title and

155
00:11:06.285 --> 00:11:11.086
we can call this Projected rise in GMSL.

156
00:11:11.086 --> 00:11:17.290
But now there's one little
thing left I'd like to do.

157
00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:23.804
It's not totally obvious from looking at
this pointer what the actual value is.

158
00:11:23.804 --> 00:11:27.822
So probably a good idea to actually
put out data labels on, but

159
00:11:27.822 --> 00:11:31.932
this is also going to require
a little bit of jiggery-pokery.

160
00:11:31.932 --> 00:11:35.556
So just click somewhere onto
pie charts as selected and

161
00:11:35.556 --> 00:11:38.660
we're going to turn on data labels.

162
00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:43.018
But as you would expect, it's actually
labelled the first segment with

163
00:11:43.018 --> 00:11:47.387
the 2,000 and the pointer with the 50,
which is not what we want.

164
00:11:47.387 --> 00:11:51.111
So just click on one of your labels so
they highlight it, and

165
00:11:51.111 --> 00:11:55.952
we're going to come into our Format
data labels, Expand label options, and

166
00:11:55.952 --> 00:11:58.054
we're not going to show the value.

167
00:11:58.054 --> 00:12:02.302
Instead were going to get value from
cells, so tick that first option and

168
00:12:02.302 --> 00:12:06.555
we're now going to select and
this will seem weird, our Q3 down Q5.

169
00:12:06.555 --> 00:12:10.962
So basically I'm saying that the first
segment gets the word pointer,

170
00:12:10.962 --> 00:12:13.590
the second segment gets the 2,000.

171
00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:15.360
And that's the trick to this.

172
00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:17.890
And then I'm going to say OK.

173
00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:22.219
Now, of course we don't actually want to
see those other two labels, so I'm just

174
00:12:22.219 --> 00:12:26.330
going to click on the first one and delete
and click on the second one and delete.

175
00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:32.403
If we then decided we needed to see the
millimeters as well, because we haven't

176
00:12:32.403 --> 00:12:36.830
put that in our chart title, we can
always use our custom number formats.

177
00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:43.736
Clicking onto our value in spreadsheet,

178
00:12:43.736 --> 00:12:48.331
I'm going to come up to Number format,

179
00:12:48.331 --> 00:12:51.825
I'm going to come to Custom.

180
00:12:51.825 --> 00:12:57.095
It's going to be naught
followed by mm in a quotes.

181
00:12:57.095 --> 00:13:01.804
And when we say OK,
it changes it in the spreadsheet,

182
00:13:01.804 --> 00:13:05.374
and of course it changes it on the chart.

183
00:13:05.374 --> 00:13:10.466
We can now use this visualization to
come to our drop down list an actually

184
00:13:10.466 --> 00:13:15.400
have a look at what read we will get for
different years and scenarios.

185
00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:19.969
But, Taken that one step further and
actually added Animation.

186
00:13:19.969 --> 00:13:24.568
So, similar to what we had before and
you can look at the code if you want to,

187
00:13:24.568 --> 00:13:28.444
we've got a Reset button which
we'll set it back to 2010.

188
00:13:28.444 --> 00:13:30.583
And we've gotten Animate button,

189
00:13:30.583 --> 00:13:35.580
which will walk us through how sea
levels will rise for that scenario.

190
00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:38.925
So hopefully this has
stimulated your creativity and

191
00:13:38.925 --> 00:13:43.764
we really look forward to seeing some of
the charts that you are now creating.

192
00:13:43.764 --> 00:13:48.020
Don't forget to go and put your ideas
in this week's creative corner.
