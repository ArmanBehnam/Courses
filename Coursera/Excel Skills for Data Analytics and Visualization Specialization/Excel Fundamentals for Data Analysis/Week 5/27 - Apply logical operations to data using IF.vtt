00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:10.270
In this video, we're going to look at
performing logical operations on our data

2
00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:11.950
using the IF function.

3
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.270
Zara is now ready to actually
start doing her reconciliation and

4
00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:22.170
coming onto the Recon Analysis tab, you'll
notice that there's quite a big difference

5
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.930
between what the supplier statement is
saying and what Zara's data is saying.

6
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.220
Now she needs to work out what's
causing that difference or

7
00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.370
correct the error if that's the reason.

8
00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:40.330
So we're going to come and have a look
at our supplier invoice statement and

9
00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.720
you'll notice that there have been some
credits, but those credits are showing up

10
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.510
as positive amounts where really we should
be subtracting them from the amount paid.

11
00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.030
So we need a calculation that will
check if the type is credit, and

12
00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.725
if it is, multiply the amount by -1.

13
00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.450
Before we get into this example though,

14
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.960
let's look at a slightly simpler
example of the if statement.

15
00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.721
So coming into our invoice report,
the first thing

16
00:01:12.721 --> 00:01:17.810
Zara's going to do is work out
if an invoice is overdue or

17
00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.920
not, and we're going to do
this using out if function.

18
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.280
So clicking into M5, we're going
to type "=IF" and open our bracket.

19
00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.420
The first thing the IF
wants is a logical test,

20
00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.060
this is where you compare two
values using a logical operator.

21
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.810
So for example,
I'm going to check if my payment date

22
00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.550
is greater than or
bigger than my due date.

23
00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.750
That is an example of a logical test,

24
00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.720
a logical test must always
use a logical operator.

25
00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.470
There are six you can choose from,
equals, greater than,

26
00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.880
less than, greater than or equal to,
less than or equal to, or not equal to.

27
00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.640
The logical test will always
return either true or false.

28
00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.440
After you've put it in, type a comma and

29
00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:22.540
now you need to put what you want
to happen if it returns true.

30
00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.810
So if my payment date is
greater than my due date,

31
00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:31.280
I want to see a Yes in that cell and I put
it in double quotes because it's text.

32
00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.490
Then I type another comma and

33
00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:40.850
the last argument the if wants is
what I want to do if it's false.

34
00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.890
Well, I just want to leave the cell empty,
but there's a bit of a trick to this.

35
00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.812
You need to open your double quotes and
immediately close them.

36
00:02:47.812 --> 00:02:53.131
I'm going to close my bracket for my IF so
you can see it and then press Enter.

37
00:02:53.131 --> 00:02:58.030
And you can see all the overdue
invoices have been flagged with a "Yes".

38
00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:04.030
Now that was a very simple example just
using text, but instead of the text

39
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.890
I could put any calculation I liked and
it could be quite sophisticated.

40
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.010
Let's look at a slightly
more interesting example.

41
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:17.390
So we're now going to calculate how
many days our invoice is overdue by.

42
00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.300
Bear in mind if it's not overdue,
we actually want to just put 0.

43
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.110
We don't want it being
overdue by a negative amount.

44
00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.326
So again,
we're going to need our if statement.

45
00:03:27.326 --> 00:03:30.605
We're going to start with our "=IF", and

46
00:03:30.605 --> 00:03:36.008
this time our logical test we're
going to do slightly differently,

47
00:03:36.008 --> 00:03:41.135
we're going to check if the overdue
value is equal to nothing.

48
00:03:41.135 --> 00:03:44.316
If that is the case,
it means it's not overdue.

49
00:03:44.316 --> 00:03:49.644
So type my comma and put 0,
then type another comma.

50
00:03:49.644 --> 00:03:50.859
If it is overdue,

51
00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:56.890
I'm going to need to use my network days
that we looked at in my previous week.

52
00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.660
So I'm just going to type "Network Days",

53
00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:04.860
my start date is my due date,
my finish date is my payment date.

54
00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.550
And don't forget to include our holidays,
which is a Named Range, so

55
00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.520
I can just type "H-O-L" and
Tab, close my brackets for

56
00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.200
my NETWORKDAYS and
close my brackets for my IF.

57
00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.472
And when I press Enter,
it has now calculated

58
00:04:20.472 --> 00:04:24.640
the correct overdue days for each invoice.

59
00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:30.030
So there were two really good examples,
let's go back now and

60
00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.210
solve Zara's problem.

61
00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.310
So back in our supplier invoice statement,
we're going to come to Q2,

62
00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.010
the calculation of the dollar amount,
and we're going to double click.

63
00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.270
Now the first part of the calculation
is absolutely fine, so

64
00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:45.900
we're not going to change that.

65
00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.140
But what we're going to do
is take that result and

66
00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:52.713
if it's a credit,
we're going to multiply it by -1.

67
00:04:52.713 --> 00:04:56.140
If it's not, we'll just multiply
it by 1 so it doesn't change.

68
00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:58.470
So after our black bracket,

69
00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:03.185
we're going to type out times then
our if and open our brackets.

70
00:05:03.185 --> 00:05:09.013
Our logical test is going to be to check

71
00:05:09.013 --> 00:05:15.944
if our type is equal to credit,
then a comma.

72
00:05:15.944 --> 00:05:23.076
If it's true, we're going to need
to multiply by -1, and a comma.

73
00:05:23.076 --> 00:05:26.562
If it isn't,
we're just going to multiply by 1.

74
00:05:26.562 --> 00:05:30.464
Now close your bracket for
your if and press Enter.

75
00:05:30.464 --> 00:05:35.449
You'll see all the values have stayed
the same except the two credits,

76
00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:38.119
which are now negative, fantastic.

77
00:05:38.119 --> 00:05:42.867
Back in our Recon Analysis,
we've made a huge difference and

78
00:05:42.867 --> 00:05:45.800
are one step closer to completing it.

79
00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:52.970
So just to recap, when you need a
calculation that will do different things

80
00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:58.270
under different circumstances, probably
find that the if will solve your problem.
