00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.515
In this video,
we're going to look

2
00:00:07.515 --> 00:00:09.630
at Excel's VLOOKUP function,

3
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.885
and how it can be used
to categorize data.

4
00:00:12.885 --> 00:00:15.780
This is not the most typical
use of this function,

5
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.155
but it is exactly what
it was designed to do,

6
00:00:19.155 --> 00:00:21.719
and it does it very efficiently.

7
00:00:21.719 --> 00:00:24.105
Coming back to our scenario,

8
00:00:24.105 --> 00:00:27.140
Zara has convinced
the supplier to

9
00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.250
simplify their late
charge penalties.

10
00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:32.840
So they're now going
to be the same

11
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.710
for Melbourne and Sydney,

12
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.490
and instead they're going to
be charged on a series of

13
00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.605
block rates depending on
how overdue the invoice is.

14
00:00:41.605 --> 00:00:44.085
So Zara's noted them
in the workbook,

15
00:00:44.085 --> 00:00:48.870
and you'll see 1-4 days
gets charged at $2.25,

16
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.875
whereas 5-9 days will
be charged at $5.50.

17
00:00:52.875 --> 00:00:56.075
So she now needs
a new calculation

18
00:00:56.075 --> 00:00:58.915
that will look up the
appropriate penalty.

19
00:00:58.915 --> 00:01:00.890
In the previous video,

20
00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.685
we saw how we could solve this
problem using a nested IF.

21
00:01:04.685 --> 00:01:07.580
We would however need four IFs.

22
00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.415
This would create a very complex
and inefficient formula.

23
00:01:12.415 --> 00:01:14.750
The clue is in the language.

24
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.360
We're not saying if
it's this do that.

25
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.915
We're actually saying look
up the appropriate penalty,

26
00:01:20.915 --> 00:01:22.640
and where that's the case,

27
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.970
you're better off using
a LOOKUP function.

28
00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.810
One of the most widely
used LOOKUP functions

29
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.129
is the VLOOKUP,

30
00:01:31.129 --> 00:01:35.180
and it is perfectly suited
to this type of problem.

31
00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.980
It does have quite a
few arguments though.

32
00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:39.470
So we're going to
break it down with

33
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.270
a very simple analogy.

34
00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.780
What does the VLOOKUP do?

35
00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.295
Well, imagine that you
have somebody's name,

36
00:01:49.295 --> 00:01:51.365
but you need their
telephone number.

37
00:01:51.365 --> 00:01:53.585
You will go to the
telephone directory,

38
00:01:53.585 --> 00:01:54.965
you will find their name,

39
00:01:54.965 --> 00:01:58.445
and then you'll be able to
get their telephone number.

40
00:01:58.445 --> 00:02:01.160
That process of looking it up,

41
00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.955
the VLOOKUP automates it.

42
00:02:03.955 --> 00:02:06.375
So when we use the VLOOKUP,

43
00:02:06.375 --> 00:02:08.000
the first argument it's going to

44
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.280
ask for is a LOOKUP value.

45
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.020
That's the piece
of information you

46
00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.510
know, the person's name.

47
00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.960
The second argument is
where you're going to

48
00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.670
go and look it up, the
telephone directory.

49
00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.870
The third argument says,

50
00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.300
okay, when you find the match,

51
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.950
if there's more than one piece

52
00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.555
of corresponding information,

53
00:02:29.555 --> 00:02:31.940
which one do you
want to get back?

54
00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.270
So if there was a telephone
number and an address,

55
00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.990
we need to specify
which one we wanted.

56
00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.775
Finally, we have the option to

57
00:02:40.775 --> 00:02:44.120
choose whether we want
to do a range LOOKUP,

58
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:50.190
that's looking in within a
range or an exact match.

59
00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.885
In this first example,

60
00:02:53.885 --> 00:02:56.105
we're going to be
doing a range LOOKUP

61
00:02:56.105 --> 00:02:58.700
because we're not trying
to find an exact value.

62
00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.410
We're trying to find
something between

63
00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.165
1-5 or between 5-10, for example.

64
00:03:04.165 --> 00:03:06.690
Let's see how it works.

65
00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.690
So clicking back into O5,

66
00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.035
I'm going to type "=" and "vl".

67
00:03:13.035 --> 00:03:16.080
Now, the "v" is for vertical.

68
00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.350
So you can only use
the VLOOKUP if your

69
00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.840
look up data is
organized vertically.

70
00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.935
If it isn't, you'll
have to use HLOOKUP.

71
00:03:23.935 --> 00:03:27.440
Now I'm going to press
tab and my look value,

72
00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.810
the thing I know
is my overdue by.

73
00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.740
So I'm going to click on
to that and type comma.

74
00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.785
My LOOKUP table is my
new penalties table,

75
00:03:36.785 --> 00:03:39.080
and I'm going to
select the whole table

76
00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.600
but not the heading.

77
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.610
Now really important, we
haven't named this range.

78
00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.640
So I'm going to have
to press F4 to lock it

79
00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.360
in place and make sure you
get both sets of dollars.

80
00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.495
Now, I'm going to
type another comma.

81
00:03:53.495 --> 00:03:56.990
The VLOOKUP is going
to always match

82
00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:59.120
our LOOKUP value into

83
00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.640
our first column of
our LOOKUP data.

84
00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.830
But it's quite
possible there will be

85
00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:05.960
multiple columns
within the table.

86
00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.550
So we need to specify

87
00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:10.675
which column has the
value we want get back.

88
00:04:10.675 --> 00:04:15.200
In this case, it's the second
column in our LOOKUP array.

89
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.150
So we're going to type a two.

90
00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.285
VLOOKUPs are by
default range LOOKUPs.

91
00:04:23.285 --> 00:04:25.355
So if you're doing
a range LOOKUP,

92
00:04:25.355 --> 00:04:28.415
you don't have to worry
about the last argument.

93
00:04:28.415 --> 00:04:32.380
We can just close our
brackets and press enter,

94
00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.425
and there are all of our
late charges corrected.

95
00:04:36.425 --> 00:04:39.005
So the VLOOKUP function can

96
00:04:39.005 --> 00:04:41.765
easily be used for
categorizing data.

97
00:04:41.765 --> 00:04:45.020
This could be working out
which tax brackets somebody

98
00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.880
fell into or grading
your student results.

99
00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.160
The only thing to
bear in mind is that

100
00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:57.520
your LOOKUP data must be
sequenced smallest to largest.

101
00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.570
In the next video,

102
00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.495
we're going to look at a more
typical use of the VLOOKUP,

103
00:05:02.495 --> 00:05:07.260
which is when we need to
match data, so keep watching.
