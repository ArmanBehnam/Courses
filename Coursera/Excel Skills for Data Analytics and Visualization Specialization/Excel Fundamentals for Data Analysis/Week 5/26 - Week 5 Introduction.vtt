00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.780
Hi Nicky. It's been
such a great journey.

2
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.395
I'm quite sad that
this is our last week.

3
00:00:10.395 --> 00:00:13.035
Hi Prashan, I know what you mean,

4
00:00:13.035 --> 00:00:14.820
but we're going to
finish on a high with

5
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.400
some really exciting content.

6
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.490
Zara's data is now
fully prepared.

7
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:21.840
How are we going to help her

8
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.225
finish off for reconciliation?

9
00:00:24.225 --> 00:00:27.480
We're going to let Excel
do all the hard work

10
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.650
by employing the help of it's

11
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.080
logical and lookup functions.

12
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.380
Let's start with discussing
logical functions first.

13
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.315
Can you please give
us some examples

14
00:00:36.315 --> 00:00:38.160
of the logical functions
we'll be looking

15
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.895
at and suggest why they might
help us with data analysis.

16
00:00:42.895 --> 00:00:45.410
We're going to start
with the best-known

17
00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.540
and arguably most useful
logical function,

18
00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.430
which is the IF function.

19
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.380
We're then going to
move on to taking

20
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.074
a little look at its helpers,

21
00:00:53.074 --> 00:00:55.595
the AND and OR functions.

22
00:00:55.595 --> 00:00:57.215
As we'll see in the videos,

23
00:00:57.215 --> 00:00:58.940
all these functions
are really useful

24
00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.890
for performing data
transformation,

25
00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.780
cleaning, and of course,
making determinations.

26
00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.220
The IF function is
definitely one of

27
00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.930
the more useful
functions in Excel

28
00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.000
with a wide range
of applications,

29
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.920
but it can be a bit confusing for

30
00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.885
people who haven't
used it before.

31
00:01:14.885 --> 00:01:16.400
So could you please
talk us through

32
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.515
the structure of an IF function?

33
00:01:18.515 --> 00:01:22.100
Good idea. So let's say
I have a price list,

34
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.005
but if the customer
is a gold partner,

35
00:01:24.005 --> 00:01:26.245
I need to apply a five
percent discount.

36
00:01:26.245 --> 00:01:29.825
I'm going to use an IF to
make this determination.

37
00:01:29.825 --> 00:01:33.275
The first argument with an
IF is always a logical test.

38
00:01:33.275 --> 00:01:36.275
This compares two values
using a logical operator.

39
00:01:36.275 --> 00:01:37.490
So in my example,

40
00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.655
I'm going to check if
customer type equals gold.

41
00:01:40.655 --> 00:01:43.235
This will either
be true or false.

42
00:01:43.235 --> 00:01:45.650
The second argument
in the IF is what to

43
00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.050
do if the logical
test returns true.

44
00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.620
In this case, I'll
subtract the five percent.

45
00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.390
The third and final
argument is what

46
00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.000
to do if the logical
test returns false.

47
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.295
In this case, really easy,

48
00:01:58.295 --> 00:02:00.820
I just charge the usual price.

49
00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.075
That's great for true
or false situations.

50
00:02:04.075 --> 00:02:06.185
But what if I have
three outcomes?

51
00:02:06.185 --> 00:02:10.130
Let's say silver partners get
a three percent discount.

52
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.075
Well, the solution here is
actually to use another, IF.

53
00:02:14.075 --> 00:02:16.115
This is called Nesting IFs,

54
00:02:16.115 --> 00:02:17.570
and we'll see it in the videos,

55
00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.205
but basically it works like this.

56
00:02:19.205 --> 00:02:21.610
The first IF checks, if
it's a gold partner.

57
00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.855
If it is, easy they
get five percent.

58
00:02:23.855 --> 00:02:26.210
If not, the second IF

59
00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.250
is going to check if
they are silver partner,

60
00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.650
if they are, they're going
to get three percent,

61
00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.625
otherwise they're paid
the regular price.

62
00:02:33.625 --> 00:02:36.050
Now, will we be looking at

63
00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.530
other logical functions
like the IFERROR function?

64
00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.750
Good catch. Unfortunately we

65
00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.295
don't have time in the videos,

66
00:02:43.295 --> 00:02:45.410
but IFERROR is a useful function,

67
00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.600
so we've included it in
this week's toolbox,

68
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:48.920
and it is required for

69
00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.650
the practice challenge
and the assessment.

70
00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.695
So learners don't
forget to check it out.

71
00:02:54.695 --> 00:02:57.755
Great. Let's talk about
LOOKUP functions.

72
00:02:57.755 --> 00:03:00.380
Well, the first ones we'll
look at is the VLOOKUP.

73
00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.300
These are widely
used in business for

74
00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.850
connecting data sets
and for error checking.

75
00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.865
But they are often criticized
for being inefficient.

76
00:03:07.865 --> 00:03:10.820
Should we be looking at VLOOKUPs?

77
00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.790
VLOOKUPs do have their drawbacks,

78
00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.290
but Microsoft have actually

79
00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:16.910
recently overhauled the VLOOKUP

80
00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.475
and it's now super fast
even on large data sets.

81
00:03:20.475 --> 00:03:23.120
VLOOKUP is comparatively easy to

82
00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.885
learn and actually does
have its applications.

83
00:03:26.885 --> 00:03:30.380
So given now that it's a
widely used in business,

84
00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.290
I think it's important
for everyone to know it.

85
00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.125
Now, we actually have
two videos on VLOOKUPs.

86
00:03:36.125 --> 00:03:39.500
The first on categorizing
and the second on matching.

87
00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.810
Can you please explain
the difference here?

88
00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.460
Yes. In the first video,

89
00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:45.920
we're going to look at what's
called a range lookup.

90
00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.210
This is less well-known,

91
00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:48.410
but a really good option that

92
00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.285
allows us to categorize data.

93
00:03:50.285 --> 00:03:52.310
So rather than doing
an exact match,

94
00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.380
it looks to see what
range and number

95
00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.570
falls within. This is ideal.

96
00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.000
For example, if you were
trying to say grade papers,

97
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.070
you don't want to have to
provide a lookup table

98
00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:04.100
detailing every possible grade
that students might get.

99
00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.930
You just want to say if it falls

100
00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.410
between 70 and 79, they get a B.

101
00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.570
That's where you'd
use a range lookup.

102
00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.260
The other video focuses on

103
00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.260
the more commonly used
exact match VLOOKUP.

104
00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:16.505
This is where you want to look up

105
00:04:16.505 --> 00:04:18.800
a specific thing
like a Customer ID,

106
00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.090
and return a corresponding
value like the Customer Name.

107
00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.560
As you say, VLOOKUP is one of

108
00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.555
those functions you have to know.

109
00:04:26.555 --> 00:04:29.120
But it does have the
limitation that you can only

110
00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.030
return the value to the
right of the lookup column.

111
00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.670
So can you please
suggest an alternative?

112
00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:37.310
I can. A brand new function

113
00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:38.900
called XLOOKUP has recently been

114
00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.565
introduced and it addresses

115
00:04:40.565 --> 00:04:43.130
all the limitations
of the VLOOKUP.

116
00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:45.590
It works vertically
and horizontally,

117
00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.575
and it even allows a search
on wildcard characters.

118
00:04:48.575 --> 00:04:52.375
So really exciting and we
will take a quick peek at it.

119
00:04:52.375 --> 00:04:54.360
I think the XLOOKUP,

120
00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.454
may eventually
replace the VLOOKUP,

121
00:04:56.454 --> 00:04:59.330
but a lot of people don't have
it yet as it's only being

122
00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.765
rolled out to Office 365
users at this stage.

123
00:05:02.765 --> 00:05:05.485
So what other options are there?

124
00:05:05.485 --> 00:05:08.615
Well, that's a question our
last video we'll answer.

125
00:05:08.615 --> 00:05:09.500
We're going to look at

126
00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.510
two very versatile
LOOKUP functions

127
00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:12.890
called INDEX and MATCH.

128
00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:15.035
They can be used independently,

129
00:05:15.035 --> 00:05:17.900
but typically we nest the
MATCH inside the INDEX,

130
00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.790
which gives us a very
flexible lookup.

131
00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:23.225
With two matches, you get
a potent two-way lookup.

132
00:05:23.225 --> 00:05:25.400
It's going to be a busy week.

133
00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.700
Any last words of encouragement
for our learners?

134
00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.040
Yeah, be patient with yourselves,

135
00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:34.975
learning is a process and
practice, practice, practice.

136
00:05:34.975 --> 00:05:37.590
Because practice makes permanent.

137
00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:39.830
Thanks Nicky. So let's recap

138
00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:42.125
the topics you'll be
covering this week.

139
00:05:42.125 --> 00:05:45.140
Performing logical
operations with IF,

140
00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:48.110
applying advanced
logical operations,

141
00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.750
categorizing data with VLOOKUP,

142
00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:54.035
matching data with
VLOOKUP and XLOOKUP,

143
00:05:54.035 --> 00:05:57.545
and then advanced data
matching with INDEX and MATCH.

144
00:05:57.545 --> 00:06:00.170
You've got another great
video for each topic

145
00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:03.140
and some challenging quizzes
for you to test yourself.

146
00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:05.570
Don't forget to check
out the toolbox as it

147
00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:08.015
will help you with this
week's practice challenge.

148
00:06:08.015 --> 00:06:12.510
You're now on your way to
becoming an Excel ninja.
