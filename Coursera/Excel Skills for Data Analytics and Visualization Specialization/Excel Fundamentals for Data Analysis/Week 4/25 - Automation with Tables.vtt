00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.700
In this video, we're going
to look at how easy it is

2
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.435
to automate workbook
functionality using tables.

3
00:00:12.435 --> 00:00:14.835
You may recall in the last week,

4
00:00:14.835 --> 00:00:17.070
we created a drop-down
list to show

5
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.075
location and to make
it update dynamically.

6
00:00:21.075 --> 00:00:23.670
We used the dynamic Named Range.

7
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.710
Now that worked,
but the problem of

8
00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.090
the dynamic range is it's
quite complex to set up.

9
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.590
A lot of other people
who may be using

10
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.575
the workbook are not
going to understand them,

11
00:00:34.575 --> 00:00:37.590
so they're not always
the best choice.

12
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.110
A much easier option
is to replace

13
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.440
the dynamic name
range with a table.

14
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.790
We're going to see how
we do that from scratch.

15
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.680
So I've removed the locations
named range that we

16
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.540
created last time and

17
00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.600
we're going to do it
from the beginning.

18
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.755
So come to our Recon Analysis,

19
00:00:58.755 --> 00:01:00.120
we're going to start with

20
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.370
creating our simple Named Range.

21
00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.100
We're going to select Locations
down to Melbourne and

22
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.565
keyboard shortcut "Control +
shift + F3" and press "Enter".

23
00:01:15.565 --> 00:01:17.990
So that's not a dynamic one,

24
00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.215
but let's check if it's working.

25
00:01:20.215 --> 00:01:23.270
Coming back to our
Invoice report,

26
00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.925
we're going to come to Location,

27
00:01:25.925 --> 00:01:29.000
click the drop-down and

28
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.645
there are two Locations,
so that's fine.

29
00:01:31.645 --> 00:01:34.040
Now the problem is
a brand new city

30
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.285
has just come on board,

31
00:01:35.285 --> 00:01:37.520
which is the city of Perth.

32
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.000
They actually just produced
a last minute invoice,

33
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.210
which Zara needs to
add into her data.

34
00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.550
The first thing we want to do is

35
00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.695
add Perth into our Summary data.

36
00:01:48.695 --> 00:01:51.245
So it's picked up in
our drop-down list.

37
00:01:51.245 --> 00:01:54.725
To have it picked up
dynamically or automatically,

38
00:01:54.725 --> 00:01:57.880
we're going to convert
this data to a table.

39
00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.945
So click anywhere in your data

40
00:02:00.945 --> 00:02:05.250
and "Control + T" is our
keyboard shortcut.

41
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.895
Press "Enter". The
table has been added.

42
00:02:08.895 --> 00:02:11.935
The banded rows do look
a little bit silly,

43
00:02:11.935 --> 00:02:15.080
so we're just going
to turn this off.

44
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.900
Now let's see what happens
when we add Perth.

45
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.944
I'm going to click into A10

46
00:02:21.944 --> 00:02:26.250
and type "Perth"
and press "Enter".

47
00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.400
You'll notice the table has
automatically extended.

48
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.710
If we come and
check our Locations

49
00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.050
Named Range, it includes Perth.

50
00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.090
So as our table grew,

51
00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.890
the Named Range also grew.

52
00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.190
What that means is back
in our Invoice report,

53
00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.320
I can select "Perth" from
my drop-down list, great.

54
00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.500
Now we need to go and add

55
00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.160
the new Perth record at
the bottom of this data.

56
00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.480
We're going to switch our
filter to April because it's

57
00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.000
an April invoice and we

58
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.970
want to add data at the
bottom of our table.

59
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.770
Going to switch
our total row off,

60
00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:11.670
come back up to Table Design
and untick "Total row".

61
00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.945
Now make sure you've
clicked into A89,

62
00:03:14.945 --> 00:03:17.710
which is the first row
underneath the table.

63
00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:20.500
We're going to type
our payment reference,

64
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:27.560
which is "24888_1"
and press Tab.

65
00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.960
As we saw with the
previous example,

66
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.025
our table has automatically
extended down

67
00:03:34.025 --> 00:03:38.000
and everything within the
table has extended as well.

68
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.130
So the named ranges,

69
00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.515
the calculations, the formatting,

70
00:03:42.515 --> 00:03:44.570
the Conditional Formatting, and

71
00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.780
Data Validation all copy down.

72
00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.200
So it's a lot of processes
being automated.

73
00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.115
Now, we don't want to spend
ages typing the data in.

74
00:03:55.115 --> 00:03:57.140
So for speed, I'm just going to

75
00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.330
copy the data in the row above,

76
00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:06.195
"Control + C" and click
into B89 and "Control + V".

77
00:04:06.195 --> 00:04:08.120
Then I'm going to come into

78
00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.350
my location and I'm
going to type "Perth".

79
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.420
When I tab, it
automatically goes

80
00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.675
blue because that is
my selected Location.

81
00:04:17.675 --> 00:04:20.615
Over here I was
going to type "800".

82
00:04:20.615 --> 00:04:24.145
So we've now added
our new invoice.

83
00:04:24.145 --> 00:04:27.720
Let's come back to our
Recon Analysis and just

84
00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.275
see one Perth invoice for $800.

85
00:04:31.275 --> 00:04:35.045
So this table is automatically
picking up the new values

86
00:04:35.045 --> 00:04:36.710
because it's also referring to

87
00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.770
the name branches
which have grown.

88
00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.895
So we've now seen that we've

89
00:04:40.895 --> 00:04:43.250
automated the
relationship between

90
00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.050
our Recon Analysis and

91
00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:49.690
our Invoice report simply
by adding two tables.

92
00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.620
Let's take one last example,

93
00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.915
probably the most important one.

94
00:04:54.915 --> 00:04:59.040
I'm going to come back to my
Supply invoice statement.

95
00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.790
We spent a lot of time
at the beginning of

96
00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:05.330
this course adding in formulas
to clean up the data.

97
00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:06.980
But the data is going to come

98
00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.330
through and be
replaced every month

99
00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.090
and we don't want to have to go

100
00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.790
through all of that
every single month.

101
00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:15.980
What we want is
something that can be

102
00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:18.785
reused and by putting
it in the table,

103
00:05:18.785 --> 00:05:20.660
we get exactly that.

104
00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.015
Now to demonstrate this properly,

105
00:05:23.015 --> 00:05:26.590
I'm just going to unhide
those columns we hid earlier.

106
00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:32.200
So select "D" and "K",
right-click and "Unhide".

107
00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:36.305
So there's all the data that
we had to start off with.

108
00:05:36.305 --> 00:05:38.450
Everything from Column L

109
00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:42.145
onwards is actually
calculations to clean it up.

110
00:05:42.145 --> 00:05:43.820
So come next month,

111
00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:45.890
what we're going
to do is clean out

112
00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:47.120
this data because it's not

113
00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.875
what we're working with anymore.

114
00:05:48.875 --> 00:05:50.780
Then we're going to Import, Copy,

115
00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:54.390
Paste the new data
into our table.

116
00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:56.880
How do we clean it out?

117
00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.650
Well, we can start by selecting

118
00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:03.645
the first row and then
"Control + Shift + Down Arrow".

119
00:06:03.645 --> 00:06:06.150
Then to remove, we're

120
00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.250
going to either press
the "Delete" on

121
00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:09.975
a ribbon or "Control +

122
00:06:09.975 --> 00:06:12.855
minus" to actually
remove these rows.

123
00:06:12.855 --> 00:06:15.699
So we're not just
deleting the data,

124
00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:18.760
we're actually removing
those table rows.

125
00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.870
The table is still there.

126
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:23.260
It still has all
the calculations,

127
00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:24.865
all the Named Ranges,

128
00:06:24.865 --> 00:06:28.705
but it doesn't have any
data in it at the moment.

129
00:06:28.705 --> 00:06:30.940
When we get our new data and I've

130
00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:33.560
got some demo data
sheets to work with,

131
00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.655
I'm going to "Copy".

132
00:06:35.655 --> 00:06:38.005
You can see that data is messy,

133
00:06:38.005 --> 00:06:40.180
just like our earlier data.

134
00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:44.314
When I come back to my
Supply Invoice Statement,

135
00:06:44.314 --> 00:06:49.365
clicking the first empty
row of my table and paste,

136
00:06:49.365 --> 00:06:53.560
"Control + V". It has
pasted the new data in,

137
00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.120
automatically resized
the table and

138
00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.725
automatically applied all
the cleaning operations.

139
00:06:59.725 --> 00:07:02.525
So once you set up the table with

140
00:07:02.525 --> 00:07:06.500
all the formulas which become
like rules in the table,

141
00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:09.490
you can just reuse it thereafter.

142
00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:13.865
So we have now automated the
whole process of cleaning

143
00:07:13.865 --> 00:07:18.365
and summarizing our data
just by applying tables.

144
00:07:18.365 --> 00:07:20.900
Applying tables
makes it much easier

145
00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:23.170
to work with our
data at this level.

146
00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:24.530
But as we start using

147
00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:26.180
more advanced functions like

148
00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:28.505
pivot tables and Power Pivot,

149
00:07:28.505 --> 00:07:31.055
they become even more important.

150
00:07:31.055 --> 00:07:33.470
So start thinking about
how you can start

151
00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:36.870
using tables in your own data.
