00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.530
Hi Nicky, great to see you again.

2
00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:08.422
I have an important
question I need to ask.

3
00:00:08.422 --> 00:00:10.580
>> Hi, Prashan.

4
00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.210
What is that?

5
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.830
>> So over the last few weeks,
we have added all these calculations and

6
00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:17.060
Named Ranges.

7
00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.600
But now, let's say, I add another
transaction at the bottom of the data.

8
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.030
I don't want to have to manually
update all the Named Ranges and

9
00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:26.790
copy down the formulas.

10
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.110
Are we going to look at
a way of automating this?

11
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.090
>> That is exactly the right question.

12
00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.040
And I'm sure a lot of our learners
are wondering the same thing.

13
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.240
For efficiency and correctness, this
process definitely needs to be automated.

14
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.090
Now, some organizations will
use macros to do this, but

15
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.980
macros come with their own problems.

16
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.900
So we're going to look at a far superior
and simpler solution called a table.

17
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.250
And that's what this week is all about.

18
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.890
>> Tables are one of my
favorite features in Excel, but

19
00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.130
the name may be a bit confusing to
people who haven't used them before,

20
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:04.250
because a spreadsheet looks a lot like
a table with columns rows and cells.

21
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.160
So how would you explain the difference?

22
00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.570
>> Well,
although Excel provides a grid layout for

23
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.070
us to work in, this is called a range.

24
00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.160
It's not structured way of storing data.

25
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.830
We can put any information anywhere, and
they do not need to be related in any way.

26
00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.160
When we talk about a table in Excel,
we mean more like a database table,

27
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.820
which contains a set of related
information, like all our HR data.

28
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.010
>> In other words, each column in
a table holds one type of information,

29
00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.230
like the employee ID, and
each row represents one record.

30
00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.935
For example, all the information
about one particular staff member.

31
00:01:41.935 --> 00:01:43.990
>> Yeah, that's exactly right.

32
00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.400
>> The problem with databases is they
can be quite complex to work with.

33
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.400
Are we going to find tables as complex?

34
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.580
>> Actually, quite the opposite,
one of the reasons we work with tables in

35
00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.970
Excel is they make it much
easier to work with our data.

36
00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.720
>> Can you just give us some examples?

37
00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.570
>> Well,
you'll see this in the practice videos.

38
00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.420
Tables are very easy to create.

39
00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.930
And once your data is in a table,

40
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.700
it becomes much easier to format,
select, and even sort and filter.

41
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.690
They also offer the opportunity
to add a total row where you

42
00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.440
literally put a row at the bottom.

43
00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.060
You can just, from a drop-down,
pick the operation you want, and

44
00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.610
it will do the calculation for you.

45
00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:22.490
So it's really cool.

46
00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.570
>> And can you perform
calculations with data in tables,

47
00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.180
like you would in a normal range?

48
00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.340
>> Yeah, I mean, a table,
you can continue to work

49
00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.750
with your data in a table exactly
as you would in a normal range.

50
00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.390
But you will find the formulas do look
slightly different, because tables use yet

51
00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.810
another form of referencing
calleds "structured referencing".

52
00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.430
>> Are structured references
a bit like named ranges?

53
00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.340
>> Yeah, conceptually, they're very
similar, but they use square brackets.

54
00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.110
So they look a little bit different, and
they aren't absolute like Named Ranges.

55
00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.300
Structured references refer to a single
cell in a table are relative, and

56
00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.670
structured references that refer to
entire column are more like mixed.

57
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.485
They remain absolute when you
drag your form is down, but

58
00:03:09.485 --> 00:03:11.210
they're relative if you drag across.

59
00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.750
>> So tables are a good idea for
storing and working with structured data.

60
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.280
But coming back to my original question,

61
00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.210
how are they going to solve
our automation needs?

62
00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:24.700
>> Well, that's the best bit.

63
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:30.240
When you add data directly underneath or
to the right of a table, it automatically

64
00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:35.720
extends or grows to include that new data,
and all your formulas, your formatting,

65
00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.370
your data validation, even your
conditional formatting extend with it.

66
00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.960
And of course, so do your Named Ranges.

67
00:03:44.385 --> 00:03:48.615
>> So that means a table basically
behaves like a dynamic Named Range, and

68
00:03:48.615 --> 00:03:51.875
that any calculations referring
to those Named Ranges will

69
00:03:51.875 --> 00:03:54.965
automatically pick up the new values.

70
00:03:54.965 --> 00:03:56.125
>> Exactly.

71
00:03:56.125 --> 00:03:57.365
And it works for charts too.

72
00:03:57.365 --> 00:03:59.030
So as you add or

73
00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:04.810
remove data from the table, any charts
looking at that data automatically adjust.

74
00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.450
So the simple step of
converting your data to a table

75
00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.400
totally automate your workbooks.

76
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.998
So tables are really important when you
start working with pivot tables, for

77
00:04:13.998 --> 00:04:14.629
example.

78
00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:16.837
And we look at those in the next course.

79
00:04:16.837 --> 00:04:20.229
And when you get into more
advanced topics, like Power Pivot,

80
00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:22.855
then you're really going
to need to use tables.

81
00:04:24.115 --> 00:04:25.685
>> Really powerful stuff.

82
00:04:25.685 --> 00:04:28.395
I'm sure our learners
can't wait to get started.

83
00:04:28.395 --> 00:04:32.910
We have five great videos for you this
week that will cover the following topics,

84
00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:38.250
creating, naming and removing tables,
formatting and selecting in tables,

85
00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:43.770
sorting and filtering tables, performing
calculations with structured references,

86
00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.150
and then automating processes with tables.

87
00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.810
Don't forget to download
this week's workbooks, so

88
00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.360
you can practice the skills as you go.

89
00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.450
We've got the usual quizzes for
you to test your skills and

90
00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.440
another great practice challenge.

91
00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:58.460
Have fun with it.

92
00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.410
And now, it's over to you.
