2
00:00:05.334 --> 00:00:06.396
In this video,

3
00:00:06.396 --> 00:00:11.396
we're going to look at performing
calculations with values in tables.

4
00:00:11.396 --> 00:00:14.898
We're going to start in
the supply invoice statement.

5
00:00:14.898 --> 00:00:19.419
And the first thing Zara would
like to do is find out the total

6
00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:22.505
amount paid according to our supplier.

7
00:00:22.505 --> 00:00:27.665
So we're going to click into W1 and
we're doing sum, so

8
00:00:27.665 --> 00:00:34.886
"=sum", Tab to open our brackets,
and we didn't use Named Ranges in here.

9
00:00:34.886 --> 00:00:38.412
So we're going to select our column.

10
00:00:38.412 --> 00:00:44.564
Remember we can just come up to the top of
the column, not the worksheet column but

11
00:00:44.564 --> 00:00:50.103
the table column and single click,
and it has selected the whole thing.

12
00:00:50.103 --> 00:00:54.400
But what's happened over
here is quite unusual.

13
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.982
Instead of putting our
usual cell references,

14
00:00:57.982 --> 00:01:03.622
Excel put what's called a structured
reference, and this is what you're

15
00:01:03.622 --> 00:01:08.649
going to get when you perform
calculations with values in a table.

16
00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:11.457
It's quite easy to understand.

17
00:01:11.457 --> 00:01:14.185
It starts with the name of the table,

18
00:01:14.185 --> 00:01:18.855
it then has the name of the column
enclosed in square brackets.

19
00:01:18.855 --> 00:01:23.913
And this is saying add up
the values in the amount

20
00:01:23.913 --> 00:01:28.101
column in the table, table supplier.

21
00:01:28.101 --> 00:01:32.260
And when we press Enter,
we get the answer.

22
00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.073
Now structured references are very robust.

23
00:01:36.073 --> 00:01:40.929
If I change the name of the table,
the structured reference will update.

24
00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:43.271
If I remove the table altogether,

25
00:01:43.271 --> 00:01:47.812
the structured reference will
revert back to normal references.

26
00:01:47.812 --> 00:01:52.263
So a little bit more
robust than named ranges.

27
00:01:52.263 --> 00:01:54.637
Let's look at another example.

28
00:01:54.637 --> 00:02:00.766
So I'd like to know how many payments were
made altogether according to the supplier.

29
00:02:00.766 --> 00:02:05.561
And for this we're going to
use Excel's rows function.

30
00:02:05.561 --> 00:02:10.189
So I'm going to type "=ROW", and

31
00:02:10.189 --> 00:02:13.369
down to select rows plural.

32
00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:19.760
And now it's asking for a column,
a row, or even a block of data.

33
00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.724
I can use the entire table.

34
00:02:22.724 --> 00:02:28.491
So if I just type "TB" and
select my table supplier,

35
00:02:28.491 --> 00:02:32.441
it has selected the whole table.

36
00:02:32.441 --> 00:02:37.486
I could have chosen a column as well,
but that will work fine.

37
00:02:37.486 --> 00:02:41.719
And when I press Enter, 84 rows.

38
00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:44.434
And let's look at something
quite interesting.

39
00:02:44.434 --> 00:02:49.824
The next thing Zara wants to do is
find out for each invoice how many

40
00:02:49.824 --> 00:02:55.315
days it was since the invoice being
issued and invoice being paid.

41
00:02:55.315 --> 00:03:00.659
So we're going to take the paid date and
subtract the invoice date.

42
00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:04.681
We're clicking into T2 and
typing "=", and

43
00:03:04.681 --> 00:03:09.501
I'm going to click on Paid Date,
couple of differences.

44
00:03:09.501 --> 00:03:14.882
First of all, you'll notice the table
name has not been included this time.

45
00:03:14.882 --> 00:03:17.567
Well, I'll explain why in a moment, but

46
00:03:17.567 --> 00:03:21.888
the other thing that's different
is its included this at symbol.

47
00:03:21.888 --> 00:03:24.496
We didn't select the whole column.

48
00:03:24.496 --> 00:03:28.546
We're not actually trying to work
with the whole column this time.

49
00:03:28.546 --> 00:03:31.036
We're only trying to work
with the single cell.

50
00:03:31.036 --> 00:03:35.861
And what that at means is get the value in

51
00:03:35.861 --> 00:03:39.964
this row in the paid date column.

52
00:03:39.964 --> 00:03:42.431
Let's do our minus now.

53
00:03:42.431 --> 00:03:45.876
We're going to click on Invoice Date.

54
00:03:45.876 --> 00:03:49.886
And you'll see they get the same thing.

55
00:03:49.886 --> 00:03:54.023
Subtract the invoice
date value in this row.

56
00:03:54.023 --> 00:03:57.575
Okay, we're now going to press Enter.

57
00:03:57.575 --> 00:03:59.668
How amazing was that?

58
00:03:59.668 --> 00:04:04.631
It has extended the table
one column to the right and

59
00:04:04.631 --> 00:04:07.523
copy the formula down for us.

60
00:04:07.523 --> 00:04:13.710
And now the only thing left for us to do
is to come in and give it a sensible name.

61
00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:18.170
So we're going to call this "Days To Pay".

62
00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:21.950
Just click on cell and type the name.

63
00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:26.562
And now we see why we didn't include
the table name because Excel

64
00:04:26.562 --> 00:04:30.332
realized that this was going
to be part of the table.

65
00:04:30.332 --> 00:04:33.302
So we have a calculation in a table.

66
00:04:33.302 --> 00:04:35.722
It doesn't put the table name, but

67
00:04:35.722 --> 00:04:40.803
where the calculation is outside of
the table, it will put the table name,

68
00:04:40.803 --> 00:04:44.446
because obviously we might
have more than one table.

69
00:04:44.446 --> 00:04:48.563
So it needs to be clear about
which one we are using.

70
00:04:48.563 --> 00:04:51.434
Let's have a look at
one more calculation so

71
00:04:51.434 --> 00:04:56.260
we can understand how these structured
references work a little better.

72
00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:01.121
We're going to do this in
the Recon Analysis, but

73
00:05:01.121 --> 00:05:04.256
we're going to use the MC data.

74
00:05:04.256 --> 00:05:07.902
So I'm going to click in here for
a moment.

75
00:05:07.902 --> 00:05:12.937
Now the last thing that Zara wants
to do here is find out the total

76
00:05:12.937 --> 00:05:18.736
overdue days and the total late charges
for each of our regions Sydney and

77
00:05:18.736 --> 00:05:23.800
Melbourne, and we're going to
do this in our recon analysis.

78
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:29.074
What we would like to do though is to
create a calculation that can be dragged

79
00:05:29.074 --> 00:05:34.098
down and across, because our late
charge column is actually next to our

80
00:05:34.098 --> 00:05:38.977
days overdue column and we can do
this using structured references.

81
00:05:38.977 --> 00:05:42.253
So going to start with our equals and

82
00:05:42.253 --> 00:05:47.641
remember we're going to need a SUMIFS for
this calculation.

83
00:05:47.641 --> 00:05:50.616
Now sum range is our days overdue.

84
00:05:50.616 --> 00:05:53.702
But if I use the Named Range,

85
00:05:53.702 --> 00:05:58.981
I wouldn't be able to
drive the formula across.

86
00:05:58.981 --> 00:06:04.042
If I use the structured reference,
however, interestingly I can.

87
00:06:04.042 --> 00:06:07.305
So we're going to choose our
table which is table MCI.

88
00:06:07.305 --> 00:06:13.866
But now we need to specify a column.

89
00:06:13.866 --> 00:06:18.990
And rather than typing,
if you just type your square bracket,

90
00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:23.353
look at that,
all the column names actually come up.

91
00:06:23.353 --> 00:06:27.597
And the one we want is Over Due By.

92
00:06:27.597 --> 00:06:31.957
So I'm just going to
double click to select,

93
00:06:31.957 --> 00:06:36.096
and we do need to close
our square bracket.

94
00:06:36.096 --> 00:06:41.069
Now a structured reference is a bit like a
mixed cell reference, when we drag it down

95
00:06:41.069 --> 00:06:45.271
it will still refer to the rows in
that column, so the rows are locked.

96
00:06:45.271 --> 00:06:47.789
But when we drag it across,

97
00:06:47.789 --> 00:06:52.728
it will actually move to
the next column on the right.

98
00:06:52.728 --> 00:06:55.637
Okay, now type a comma.

99
00:06:55.637 --> 00:07:01.850
The next thing we need is our
criteria range which is our location.

100
00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:06.931
Now we do not want this to
change when we drag across,

101
00:07:06.931 --> 00:07:10.280
we need this to remain absolute and

102
00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:14.684
use our named range again,
and then a comma.

103
00:07:14.684 --> 00:07:19.715
And then finally,
our actually criteria is Sydney.

104
00:07:19.715 --> 00:07:23.123
So I'm going to click on a A8, but again,

105
00:07:23.123 --> 00:07:27.585
we need a mixed reference this
time when we drag across.

106
00:07:27.585 --> 00:07:32.858
We needed to stay locked, but
when dragged down, we needed to change.

107
00:07:32.858 --> 00:07:37.024
So we're going to press F4 once,
twice, and three times.

108
00:07:37.024 --> 00:07:41.248
We've got the dollar just
in front of the A, and

109
00:07:41.248 --> 00:07:45.057
we can close our brackets and press Enter.

110
00:07:45.057 --> 00:07:48.860
Let's start with dragging the formula
down, so I'm going to double-click.

111
00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:52.920
Yep, it looks okay, and
then we're going to drag across.

112
00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:56.846
A little tip if you come
to your fill options and

113
00:07:56.846 --> 00:07:59.773
choose fill without formatting.

114
00:07:59.773 --> 00:08:04.262
You can copy your formula down
without copying the formatting.

115
00:08:04.262 --> 00:08:08.975
Well, that's looking good, but
let's just go and double check.

116
00:08:08.975 --> 00:08:13.586
So now I'll double-check this one and
you will see that it has

117
00:08:13.586 --> 00:08:18.384
moved to the next column in the table,
which is our late charge.

118
00:08:18.384 --> 00:08:23.018
It has kept the location the same and
wanted this kept,

119
00:08:23.018 --> 00:08:26.563
the A, the same, it has changed the row.

120
00:08:26.563 --> 00:08:29.571
So three types of
references we've looked at.

121
00:08:29.571 --> 00:08:34.757
There are structured references which
behave a bit like mixed cell references,

122
00:08:34.757 --> 00:08:37.134
lock in the rows but not the columns.

123
00:08:37.134 --> 00:08:41.154
Our Named Range which
are usually absolute, and

124
00:08:41.154 --> 00:08:44.597
mix references using our dollars there.

125
00:08:44.597 --> 00:08:47.899
There's no right or
wrong about which one to use.

126
00:08:47.899 --> 00:08:53.124
It's helpful to know about all three and
to use the one that will

127
00:08:53.124 --> 00:08:58.064
help you solve the problem that
you have most effectively.

128
00:08:58.064 --> 00:09:02.352
So as well as structured referencing and
calculations,

129
00:09:02.352 --> 00:09:06.115
we also had a brief look
at how tables auto extend.

130
00:09:06.115 --> 00:09:11.082
This is our first hint of
the automation capabilities in tables,

131
00:09:11.082 --> 00:09:15.700
we're going to explore this
even further in the next video.
