00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:08.220
In this video, we're
going to look at

2
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.445
sorting and filtering
data in a table.

3
00:00:11.445 --> 00:00:14.040
Now that Zara has the data all

4
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.305
set up very nicely in the table,

5
00:00:16.305 --> 00:00:18.180
she'd actually like
to start getting

6
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.180
some information
out of this data.

7
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.880
The first thing she'd
like to know is,

8
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.165
which was the highest
invoice amount paid?

9
00:00:27.165 --> 00:00:29.310
One simple way of solving

10
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.385
this problem is to sort
the data by amount.

11
00:00:32.385 --> 00:00:34.950
If we come to the amount
column at the top,

12
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.500
you see an Auto Filter button,

13
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.880
and if we click on that,

14
00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.585
it gives us a selection of

15
00:00:41.585 --> 00:00:44.485
options for sorting
and filtering.

16
00:00:44.485 --> 00:00:48.880
We are going to click "Sort
Largest to Smallest".

17
00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.310
It has sorted not just
the amount column,

18
00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.415
but the entire table,

19
00:00:54.415 --> 00:00:56.090
and we can now see

20
00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.015
the invoice that was
the most expensive.

21
00:00:59.015 --> 00:01:01.820
The next thing Zara
wants to know is,

22
00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.165
what was the earliest
invoice for Melbourne?

23
00:01:05.165 --> 00:01:08.135
So this time we're
going to need to sort

24
00:01:08.135 --> 00:01:11.330
by location and date.

25
00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.570
We are going to come to
the Location first and

26
00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.355
we're going to say "Sort A to Z",

27
00:01:18.355 --> 00:01:21.700
which will bring
Melbourne to the top.

28
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.925
But now, when we come and
sort by Invoice Date,

29
00:01:25.925 --> 00:01:27.860
we will lose our sort on

30
00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.550
location if we use the
Auto Filter buttons.

31
00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.405
Fortunately, we have
another option.

32
00:01:34.405 --> 00:01:36.440
Make sure you've
clicked somewhere in

33
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.600
the table and now come
up to your data tab.

34
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.770
We're going to the
sort and filter group,

35
00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.330
click on the "Sort" button.

36
00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.030
We already have a
sort by location.

37
00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.365
So we just need to
add another level,

38
00:01:53.365 --> 00:01:57.425
and our second level
will be invoice date.

39
00:01:57.425 --> 00:02:00.080
We do want to sort oldest to

40
00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.445
newest because we want
the first invoice date,

41
00:02:04.445 --> 00:02:07.680
and we're going to click "OK".

42
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.350
We have retained our
sort by location,

43
00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.820
but it is now sorted by
invoice date within location.

44
00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.010
So that is how we can
create a more complex sort.

45
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.630
Zara would next like to focus on

46
00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.885
just the invoices that
we issued in February.

47
00:02:25.885 --> 00:02:28.660
For this shall be better
off filtering the data and

48
00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.790
the Auto Filter buttons
we have already

49
00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.950
seen can be used to
filter data as well.

50
00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.950
So we're going to come to
our Auto Filter button,

51
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.990
click the "Dropdown", and

52
00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.320
there are all the values
that appear in this dataset.

53
00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.125
We are going to unselect all,

54
00:02:47.125 --> 00:02:52.385
choose just February,
and say "OK".

55
00:02:52.385 --> 00:02:54.420
Two things to point out,

56
00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.739
the sort has not been affected.

57
00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.080
If you have a look at
our Auto Filter buttons,

58
00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.385
it is still sorted by
location and invoice date,

59
00:03:04.385 --> 00:03:07.490
and they both have
a little up arrow.

60
00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:12.275
It has also been filtered to
only show the February data.

61
00:03:12.275 --> 00:03:14.810
So sorts and filters can run

62
00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.745
alongside each other without
interfering in any way.

63
00:03:18.745 --> 00:03:23.240
The other thing worth noting
is that the total row is

64
00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.695
now showing us just the
totals for the February data.

65
00:03:27.695 --> 00:03:32.544
So they will adjust to show
totals for the visible cells.

66
00:03:32.544 --> 00:03:35.075
Now, to clear a filter,

67
00:03:35.075 --> 00:03:38.000
you come back to the
Auto Filter button,

68
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.520
click the "Dropdown", and "Clear

69
00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.330
Filter From Invoice Month".

70
00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.720
Zara would now like to
see all the invoices that

71
00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.115
was sent in March that
were over a $1,000.

72
00:03:52.115 --> 00:03:56.185
So this time we're going
to add two filters.

73
00:03:56.185 --> 00:03:59.820
We'll start with
invoice month again.

74
00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.770
So going to click the

75
00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:05.220
dropdown and choose
"March" this time.

76
00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.770
But now I'm going to come to

77
00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.795
the Amount and click
the dropdown.

78
00:04:10.795 --> 00:04:13.445
Now, I don't want to start

79
00:04:13.445 --> 00:04:16.955
unselecting everything
that's under a 1,000.

80
00:04:16.955 --> 00:04:19.760
Fortunately, we don't have to.

81
00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.880
If we come to Number Filters,

82
00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.310
we get a fantastic array
of very rich options.

83
00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.435
So we could just get the top 10,

84
00:04:30.435 --> 00:04:34.905
the above average, but what
we want is a greater than.

85
00:04:34.905 --> 00:04:38.595
So I going to choose
"Greater Than",

86
00:04:38.595 --> 00:04:44.385
type in 1,000 and say "OK".

87
00:04:44.385 --> 00:04:49.100
Unlike the sort, when we've
added another filter,

88
00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.135
it does not replace
the first one.

89
00:04:52.135 --> 00:04:55.080
It has kept the original filter,

90
00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.420
so you can build up

91
00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:01.090
quite complex filters
just by compounding them,

92
00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.430
and we can see all
of the invoices for

93
00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:08.290
March that are over $1,000.

94
00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:11.185
When you have multiple filters,

95
00:05:11.185 --> 00:05:12.725
to clear each of them

96
00:05:12.725 --> 00:05:16.220
individually would be
quite time consuming.

97
00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.830
So another option
is to come back up

98
00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:22.275
to our Data tab and
choose "Clear".

99
00:05:22.275 --> 00:05:26.945
That we'll clear all the
filters from within this table.

100
00:05:26.945 --> 00:05:29.840
Now, everything we've
looked at so far,

101
00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:33.815
you could have done in
a normal range as well.

102
00:05:33.815 --> 00:05:38.089
But what we're going to look
at next is only available

103
00:05:38.089 --> 00:05:39.110
if you're working with

104
00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:42.020
the table and it's
called a slicer.

105
00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.380
So we're going to click
somewhere into our table,

106
00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:48.845
and we are going to come
up to our Table Design,

107
00:05:48.845 --> 00:05:53.310
and we're going to find
the Insert Slicer button.

108
00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:58.535
Now, slicer is really just
another type of filters,

109
00:05:58.535 --> 00:06:01.385
but it's very intuitive and makes

110
00:06:01.385 --> 00:06:05.785
interacting with the data far
simpler and a bit of fun.

111
00:06:05.785 --> 00:06:09.075
So we can click
"Insert the Slicer",

112
00:06:09.075 --> 00:06:12.930
and you can add as many
slicers as you have columns.

113
00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:15.065
But we'll just have to add one

114
00:06:15.065 --> 00:06:18.070
for location and one for month,

115
00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:20.700
and then we'll say "OK".

116
00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:24.170
Now, our two slices
have been added.

117
00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:28.250
At the moment, they're
sitting on top of the data,

118
00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:30.440
so we're going to move them.

119
00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:33.200
But first we're going
to resize them.

120
00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.845
Now, to resize them
both simultaneously,

121
00:06:36.845 --> 00:06:38.240
if you hold your shift key

122
00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.015
down and click on the second one,

123
00:06:41.015 --> 00:06:43.815
you'll see them now
both highlighted.

124
00:06:43.815 --> 00:06:47.000
You can either drag any
of the resize handles,

125
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.490
which are the little
bubbles around the edges,

126
00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:51.769
or if you want to be more exact,

127
00:06:51.769 --> 00:06:55.165
you'll notice we now have a
slicer ribbon that's showing.

128
00:06:55.165 --> 00:07:00.245
We can come and specify an
exact height and exact width.

129
00:07:00.245 --> 00:07:04.585
Click away for a moment
to unselect the slices.

130
00:07:04.585 --> 00:07:06.545
Now, to move them,

131
00:07:06.545 --> 00:07:08.390
we just click and drag them

132
00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:10.595
to where we actually
want them to be.

133
00:07:10.595 --> 00:07:11.870
I'm just going to put them

134
00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:14.815
here on the right of the table.

135
00:07:14.815 --> 00:07:17.740
Coming back to our slicer ribbon,

136
00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:20.449
there are a few useful options.

137
00:07:20.449 --> 00:07:23.950
One of them is our slices styles.

138
00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:26.005
If I click the dropdown,

139
00:07:26.005 --> 00:07:28.100
I can add some styling to each of

140
00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:31.225
my slices to make
them a little nicer.

141
00:07:31.225 --> 00:07:34.655
But now let's see how
they actually work.

142
00:07:34.655 --> 00:07:37.010
Let's say I wanted to see all of

143
00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:40.325
my invoices for April in Sydney.

144
00:07:40.325 --> 00:07:45.825
I click on "April" and I
click "Sydney", too easy.

145
00:07:45.825 --> 00:07:48.464
To clear a filter
from the slicer,

146
00:07:48.464 --> 00:07:51.290
you just click on the
top right-hand corner,

147
00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:55.770
the clear filter icon,
and it's removed.

148
00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:58.820
So we've seen how easy it is to

149
00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:01.940
sort and filter data in a table,

150
00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:05.360
and how we have this
fantastic additional option

151
00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.460
of using slices.

152
00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:09.440
In the next video,

153
00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:11.539
we're going to start
looking at performing

154
00:08:11.539 --> 00:08:15.600
calculations with data in tables.
