2
00:00:05.257 --> 00:00:06.273
In this video,

3
00:00:06.273 --> 00:00:11.680
we get to look at how we can create a name
tables in Excel from the discussion video.

4
00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.330
We talked about how tables were
really powerful automation tool.

5
00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.260
So what do we mean by that?

6
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.940
Well, we've just spent quite a lot of
time helping Zara to create a lot of

7
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:29.300
calculations and Named Ranges to make
it easier to work with this data.

8
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.820
But imagine that somebody with
maybe a little less skill

9
00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.200
had to add a new record at
the bottom of the data.

10
00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.930
They would need to make sure they'd
copy those formulas down correctly,

11
00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.880
added the data validation,
added the conditional formatting, and

12
00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.640
updated all the Named Ranges.

13
00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.760
That's a big ask.

14
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.710
It's going to take a while, and

15
00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.990
most importantly, they may not
have the skill to do it correctly.

16
00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:05.680
So automating this process becomes
very important to businesses.

17
00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.210
And it does become very easy.

18
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.330
All they have to do is use a table.

19
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.530
Now, not all data lends itself
to be converted to a table.

20
00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.180
We're looking for
databases of data like this,

21
00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.030
organized into columns where they
store one type of information, and

22
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.950
where each row represents a record
about one person or one thing,

23
00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.040
no blank rows, no blank columns,
but blank cells are fine.

24
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.890
And ideally,
the data is not touching anything else.

25
00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.020
If that's the case,
creating a table is very easy.

26
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.870
We just click somewhere in the data.

27
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.850
We come up to our "Insert" tab,
and we click Table.

28
00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.000
It double checks that this is
the range you have intended.

29
00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.550
And if you followed all the guidelines
that we stipulated, that will be correct.

30
00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:10.670
If it isn't correct, you can always go and
select the right range.

31
00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.440
And my table does have headers,

32
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.610
so I'm just going to say okay.

33
00:02:19.105 --> 00:02:21.790
Now, quite a few things have happened.

34
00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.300
We've got some great formatting.

35
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.340
Auto filter buttons being added
to the top of each column.

36
00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.090
And perhaps more subtle,
a brand new ribbon tab has appeared,

37
00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.970
called Table Design, or in other
versions of Excel, table tools design.

38
00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:46.480
Now, if I click outside of the Table,
you see, I don't have that ribbon tab.

39
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.750
And when I click back in, it reappears.

40
00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.330
So please make sure when you
are working in the Table

41
00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.090
that you've clicked inside it.

42
00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.900
Now, coming up to the Table Design
ribbon on the left hand side,

43
00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.650
you can see the table has
automatically been given a name.

44
00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.010
Table1 is not a great name.

45
00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.910
So one of the first things I'd
suggest is you replace this.

46
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.305
And I'm going to call this tbl_Supplier.

47
00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.454
The same rules apply for
table names as for Named Ranges.

48
00:03:29.454 --> 00:03:34.060
The tbl is not required at all, but

49
00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.220
it actually makes it much easier
to distinguish our tables from

50
00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:46.080
our Named Ranges, and
to find them quickly in the autocomplete.

51
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.810
So it's just a recommendation.

52
00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.840
Once you finish typing, you can
just click away or press enter, and

53
00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.730
there's your table appropriately named.

54
00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.070
Let's have a look at that again.

55
00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:03.820
So I'm going to come to
the MC Invoice Report.

56
00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.700
And we're going to turn
this into a table as well.

57
00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.240
Click somewhere in the data,
come to table.

58
00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.370
But this time,
I'm going to hover for a moment.

59
00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.330
And you'll see the keyboard
shortcut is "CTRL+T".

60
00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:25.740
Next time, we'll use that one.

61
00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.910
I'm going to click table, and
then I can just press Enter, and

62
00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:33.250
my table has been added.

63
00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.410
Now, what if I needed to remove
this table for some reason?

64
00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.120
Let's just say, we don't want it anymore.

65
00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.120
Well, that's easy to do.

66
00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:49.920
But before you do, you need to decide
if you want to keep the formatting.

67
00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.330
Because when you remove the table,

68
00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.132
the formatting will not
automatically be removed.

69
00:04:56.132 --> 00:05:00.740
So to remove the formatting,

70
00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:05.670
we come to our Table Styles and
just choose Light,

71
00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.330
which has put it back to how it
was before we added the table.

72
00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.980
And then to remove the table,
we click Convert to Range.

73
00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.600
It double checks, it's fine.

74
00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:29.810
Removing the table will not impact
the workbook or formulas in any way.

75
00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:36.670
So we can just press Enter, and now we're
back to what's called a regular range.

76
00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.530
We do, however, actually want the table.

77
00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:42.770
So let's create it again.

78
00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:49.720
But this time, I'll use the keyboard
shortcut Ctrl+t and Enter.

79
00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.220
Now, we do not want to call it Table3.

80
00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:57.150
So I'm going to come up here and

81
00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:03.250
call this tbl_MC, and then Enter.

82
00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:09.830
So far, we have looked at how to
create a table, we name the table,

83
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:11.260
and we remove the table.

84
00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:17.570
In the next video, we can have a bit
more fun, making our tables look good.
