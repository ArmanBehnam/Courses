00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.620
In this video, we're going
to look at how we can

2
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.305
customize and work
with tables in Excel.

3
00:00:10.305 --> 00:00:12.000
In the previous video,

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.055
we helped Zara
create this table.

5
00:00:14.055 --> 00:00:16.680
But she doesn't actually
want the blue stripes,

6
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.530
and manually changing it
could take a lot of time.

7
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:21.735
Fortunately, working with tables,

8
00:00:21.735 --> 00:00:23.310
it's really straightforward.

9
00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.280
We are going to
click somewhere into

10
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.170
our table and in the ribbon,

11
00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.240
the "Table Design"
ribbon comes up.

12
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.705
So I'm going to click on that.

13
00:00:31.705 --> 00:00:35.675
On the far right, we see a
gallery of table designs.

14
00:00:35.675 --> 00:00:37.490
If you hover over that gallery,

15
00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.235
you will see a live preview.

16
00:00:39.235 --> 00:00:41.555
So we haven't
actually selected it,

17
00:00:41.555 --> 00:00:44.545
we've just hovered to
get even more options.

18
00:00:44.545 --> 00:00:46.175
We click the "More" button,

19
00:00:46.175 --> 00:00:48.680
which is the drop-down on
the far right-hand corner,

20
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.585
and there's quite a
lot to choose from.

21
00:00:50.585 --> 00:00:53.690
So take a moment to hover
over the different options,

22
00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.470
and find one you like
and click to select.

23
00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.155
I'm going to go for blue
table style medium 16.

24
00:01:00.155 --> 00:01:03.050
So we can see how
quick it is to make

25
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.965
a massive change to the
formatting in a workbook.

26
00:01:05.965 --> 00:01:08.235
But there's even more we can do,

27
00:01:08.235 --> 00:01:10.200
using the "Table Styles Options"

28
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.375
to the left of the table styles.

29
00:01:12.375 --> 00:01:16.010
Let's say we didn't want the
alternating colored rows.

30
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.260
Excel calls these banded rows,

31
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.225
and we can simply select it.

32
00:01:20.225 --> 00:01:22.280
We could instead turn on banded

33
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.460
columns for alternating
colored columns.

34
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.435
We can also make our
first column standout.

35
00:01:28.435 --> 00:01:31.640
This will vary depending on
which style you've chosen.

36
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.080
But very often, that has

37
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.720
the main or unique
identifier for that row,

38
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.480
so that's quite useful,

39
00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.460
and you can make your last
column stand out as well,

40
00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.710
which is great if
you've got a subtotal.

41
00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.960
In this case, we don't want it,

42
00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.240
so we're going to unselect it.

43
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.950
But the best option in this
group is the total row.

44
00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.510
Can you find the
total row check box

45
00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:55.775
and just put a little tick in it?

46
00:01:55.775 --> 00:01:58.130
What that has done is add

47
00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.650
a total row at the
bottom of our data,

48
00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.360
and some of the furthest right

49
00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.870
numeric column, which is great.

50
00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.445
So I've got my total late charge,

51
00:02:07.445 --> 00:02:11.320
but actually I'd really like
my total invoice amount.

52
00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.860
So we're going to click into

53
00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.965
the total row under
the Amount column,

54
00:02:15.965 --> 00:02:18.095
and we're going to
click the drop-down,

55
00:02:18.095 --> 00:02:20.290
and we're going to choose sum,

56
00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.660
and sum isn't the only
function we can use.

57
00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.580
So let's say we
actually wanted to

58
00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.350
see an average late charge.

59
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:28.969
If I come to my drop-down,

60
00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:30.550
I could choose an average.

61
00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.210
If I wanted to count

62
00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.505
how many rows there
were in the table,

63
00:02:34.505 --> 00:02:37.330
it doesn't really matter
which column I choose,

64
00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.245
I'm going to go for
payment number,

65
00:02:39.245 --> 00:02:42.245
click the drop-down,
and choose count.

66
00:02:42.245 --> 00:02:45.440
What's really great about
the total row is when

67
00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.380
we need to add new data to
the bottom of the table,

68
00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.805
we just turn it off,

69
00:02:49.805 --> 00:02:52.350
pop on your data in,

70
00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.170
and then we turn it back on.

71
00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.710
It will appear
underneath the new data,

72
00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.140
and include those new values,

73
00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.940
so making it much easier
to work with our data.

74
00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.290
Another feature you may not have

75
00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.485
noticed is we are down at row 89,

76
00:03:09.485 --> 00:03:11.150
and yet when I said click in

77
00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.565
the Payment Number
or the Due Date,

78
00:03:13.565 --> 00:03:16.430
you have no problem
identifying the column.

79
00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.725
What we would normally
see if I click

80
00:03:18.725 --> 00:03:21.110
out of the table is
the column letters.

81
00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.255
But because we've got a table,

82
00:03:23.255 --> 00:03:25.399
we actually get the
column headings,

83
00:03:25.399 --> 00:03:27.425
so another great little feature.

84
00:03:27.425 --> 00:03:30.440
Let's go back up to
the top of our table,

85
00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.585
so I'm going to use
the keyboard shortcut

86
00:03:32.585 --> 00:03:34.675
"Control + Up Arrow".

87
00:03:34.675 --> 00:03:37.850
Another feature the
table offers us is

88
00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.380
the ability to more easily

89
00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.585
select the data within the table.

90
00:03:41.585 --> 00:03:45.215
So up to now when we need
to select a column of data,

91
00:03:45.215 --> 00:03:48.100
we've been doing "Control +
S1hift + Down Arrow".

92
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.565
But within the table,
you don't need to.

93
00:03:50.565 --> 00:03:52.160
So let's say I want to select

94
00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.295
the column, Purchase
Order Number,

95
00:03:54.295 --> 00:03:56.720
I'm not going to click into the H

96
00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.480
because that will select
the whole worksheet column,

97
00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.595
and I just want the table column.

98
00:04:01.595 --> 00:04:03.290
So I'm going to come to

99
00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.660
just on that Purchase
Order Number,

100
00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.185
and I get a tiny black arrow,

101
00:04:08.185 --> 00:04:09.845
and when I single-click,

102
00:04:09.845 --> 00:04:11.845
it selects all the data.

103
00:04:11.845 --> 00:04:15.065
If I click again, it
includes the heading.

104
00:04:15.065 --> 00:04:18.620
If I now wanted to
change my table and move

105
00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:19.940
the purchase order column to

106
00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.960
before the bank details column,

107
00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.950
it's much easier than
with the normal range.

108
00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:27.635
Having selected the
purchase order column,

109
00:04:27.635 --> 00:04:30.220
all I need to do is
come to the edge,

110
00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.610
and sure I've got the
four arrow move icon and

111
00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.400
drag and drop it in before
the bank details column.

112
00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.210
I have now swapped the
columns without the need for

113
00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.555
copy paste and without impacting
the rest of my workbook.

114
00:04:44.555 --> 00:04:47.475
When it comes to
selecting table rows,

115
00:04:47.475 --> 00:04:49.050
is just as easy.

116
00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.925
So for example, if
I wanted to delete

117
00:04:51.925 --> 00:04:54.310
a few table rows and
I didn't want to

118
00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.055
impact anything to the
right of my table,

119
00:04:57.055 --> 00:04:59.325
I come just into the table,

120
00:04:59.325 --> 00:05:02.315
and again, get that
small black arrow.

121
00:05:02.315 --> 00:05:05.320
One click selects
just one table row,

122
00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.060
and if I click and drag,

123
00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.385
I can select multiple table rows.

124
00:05:09.385 --> 00:05:12.460
So we've seen how we
can use our styles on

125
00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.400
the Table Design ribbon
to format our table,

126
00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:16.700
and we can customize

127
00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.660
those formats using our
table style options.

128
00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:23.090
Then we saw how we could
more easily select data,

129
00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.310
and maybe move columns or delete

130
00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.880
rows by selecting either at
the top of the table column,

131
00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.330
or to the left of the table row.

132
00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:32.960
In the next video,

133
00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.030
we'll have a look at
how easy it is to

134
00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:38.580
sort and filter data in a table.
