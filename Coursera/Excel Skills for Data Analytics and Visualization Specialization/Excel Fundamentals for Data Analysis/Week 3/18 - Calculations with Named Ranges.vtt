[MUSIC]

2
00:00:05.277 --> 00:00:09.944
In this video, we're going to look at
performing calculations with Named Ranges.

3
00:00:09.944 --> 00:00:11.107
And to help us,

4
00:00:11.107 --> 00:00:17.195
we're also going to introduce two great
functions called COUNTIFS and SUMIFS.

5
00:00:17.195 --> 00:00:21.945
Zara's first calculation is she
needs to update the late charge.

6
00:00:21.945 --> 00:00:25.116
It turns out as well as the Penalty Rate,

7
00:00:25.116 --> 00:00:29.338
there's a $2 a day flat rate for
overdue invoices.

8
00:00:29.338 --> 00:00:34.460
She's also been asked not to put
the flat rate anywhere in the worksheet.

9
00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.560
The problem is we still want to
keep that single point of entry.

10
00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.972
Well, we can use a named
range to solve this.

11
00:00:42.972 --> 00:00:47.223
So we're going to come back to our
name manager on our formulas tab.

12
00:00:48.503 --> 00:00:52.584
And we're going to click the new
button to add a new range.

13
00:00:52.584 --> 00:00:55.988
And we're going to call it "flat_rate".

14
00:00:58.706 --> 00:01:02.956
We do not however wish it to refer
to a particular cell in the sheet.

15
00:01:02.956 --> 00:01:05.350
So I'm going to remove all of this and

16
00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.370
instead I'm going to
just put the number two.

17
00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:15.030
This is called a constant because
unlike a cell which can vary,

18
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:17.540
this is always going to be two.

19
00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:25.862
And then we say OK, you'll see our flat
rate has been added and we can say close.

20
00:01:25.862 --> 00:01:27.913
Let's go and change our calculation now.

21
00:01:27.913 --> 00:01:30.868
So I'm going to double-click into N5,
and

22
00:01:30.868 --> 00:01:33.914
then after Penalty Rate
I'm going to type plus.

23
00:01:33.914 --> 00:01:40.544
And then take my over due by and multiply
by my flat rate, but I can't click on it.

24
00:01:40.544 --> 00:01:44.145
Here's what makes Named
Ranges really great.

25
00:01:44.145 --> 00:01:49.945
If I type "fl" for flat_rate, it actually
comes up in my auto complete and

26
00:01:49.945 --> 00:01:54.555
I can just press tab to finish
that off and press enter.

27
00:01:56.362 --> 00:01:59.877
My flat rate has been added and
I can double-click to copy that down.

28
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.082
So that was a slightly unusual
use of Named Ranges, but

29
00:02:05.082 --> 00:02:09.758
it can be very useful for conversion rates
or values you just don't want people to

30
00:02:09.758 --> 00:02:12.890
see but you want to include
them in your calculations.

31
00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.840
Let's look at a more typical use
of Named Ranges in calculations.

32
00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.170
We're going to now come to
our Recon Analysis sheet and

33
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.890
this is where Zara actually needs to start
comparing the values in the two sheets.

34
00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.280
And the first thing she
needs is a bottom line.

35
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.400
What does the supplier say we paid?

36
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.160
What does our system say we paid?

37
00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.930
So we're going to need to add
up the amount in each sheet, but

38
00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.620
we haven't actually put a Named
Range in the supplier statement.

39
00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.431
So the first one we're going to do, you'll
see how it looks without Named Range.

40
00:02:47.431 --> 00:02:52.611
So clicking in B3,
we're going to type "=sum".

41
00:02:52.611 --> 00:02:56.031
Then tab to just open your bracket,
but now I have to go and

42
00:02:56.031 --> 00:02:58.470
select the data from a different sheet.

43
00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.079
So I'm going to click on to
the supplier invoice statement.

44
00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:05.250
I'm going to come to the top
of my amount column.

45
00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.986
Click on Q2 and you could drag down but

46
00:03:06.986 --> 00:03:09.434
it's much quicker to press
Ctrl+ Shift+ Down Arrow.

47
00:03:09.434 --> 00:03:12.165
And then really important,

48
00:03:12.165 --> 00:03:17.296
do not click back into recon analysis,
press enter.

49
00:03:17.296 --> 00:03:21.072
That has worked but
it's quite a simple calculation and

50
00:03:21.072 --> 00:03:23.246
it was fairly fiddly to create.

51
00:03:23.246 --> 00:03:27.130
And you can see resulting formula
is quite long and quite ugly.

52
00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:32.820
Let's see a very similar calculation but
this time using a Named Range.

53
00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.790
So in B4, we're going to type "=sum"
and tab to open our brackets but

54
00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.291
now we don't have to
click into that sheet.

55
00:03:39.291 --> 00:03:41.275
We can just type the Named Range.

56
00:03:41.275 --> 00:03:46.173
So am down arrow twice and tab.

57
00:03:46.173 --> 00:03:50.462
Didn't even have to use my mouse,
lovely formula as a result.

58
00:03:50.462 --> 00:03:52.801
Press enter, job done.

59
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.970
Now as our calculations get more complex
and the more we're pulling data from

60
00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:03.120
different sheets and particularly when
we then start adding dollars on as well.

61
00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:08.390
Our Named Ranges make our calculations
much more elegant and much quicker.

62
00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.642
Let's look at another example.

63
00:04:10.642 --> 00:04:15.339
So the next thing I want to do and I'll
just click back into my invoice report for

64
00:04:15.339 --> 00:04:19.965
a moment is we want to find out how many
invoices were generated from Sydney and

65
00:04:19.965 --> 00:04:21.551
how many from Melbourne.

66
00:04:21.551 --> 00:04:25.858
So, really what I want to do is count how
many times the word Sydney appears in my

67
00:04:25.858 --> 00:04:27.670
location column.

68
00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:32.491
And the function that will help
me with this is my COUNTIFS.

69
00:04:32.491 --> 00:04:35.625
So coming back to my recon analysis,

70
00:04:35.625 --> 00:04:40.689
make sure B8 is selected and
we're going to type "=cou".

71
00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:43.100
And there're quite a lot
of count functions.

72
00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.236
You'll notice there's a COUNTIF
singular and a COUNTIFS plural.

73
00:04:47.236 --> 00:04:51.407
COUNTIF singular only allows for
a single criteria,

74
00:04:51.407 --> 00:04:55.740
whereas COUNTIFS plural
is the newer one, 127 criteria.

75
00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.160
So let's use that one.

76
00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:57.980
I'm going to double-click.

77
00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.610
The first thing the COUNTIFS wants to
know is which column am I checking?

78
00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.210
And in this case, it's the location.

79
00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.270
So I'm going to just type "loc"
because I've named it and tab.

80
00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:15.301
Then a comma and it says, "fine,
I'm going to look in the location column.

81
00:05:15.301 --> 00:05:17.098
What am I looking for?"

82
00:05:17.098 --> 00:05:20.780
We're looking for the word Sydney and
then press enter.

83
00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:27.131
And when I copy that down,
there's my total invoices for Melbourne.

84
00:05:27.131 --> 00:05:31.802
Similar to the COUNTIFS,
there's also a function called SUMIFS.

85
00:05:31.802 --> 00:05:36.715
And that's what we're going to need for
our next example where we actually want to

86
00:05:36.715 --> 00:05:39.513
add up the amounts for
Sydney and Melbourne.

87
00:05:39.513 --> 00:05:43.024
So it's similar, but
when it finds the word Sydney,

88
00:05:43.024 --> 00:05:48.189
it's actually going to add up the
corresponding amount in the Amount column.

89
00:05:48.189 --> 00:05:54.311
Back in our recon analysis,
we're going to click in to C8 and

90
00:05:54.311 --> 00:06:00.074
we're going to type "=sum" and
choose SUMIFS and tab.

91
00:06:00.074 --> 00:06:04.080
Now the SUMIFS requires an additional
argument because it needs

92
00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:08.246
to know the column you're going to add and
this is our Amount Paid.

93
00:06:08.246 --> 00:06:14.442
So I'm just going to "am", down arrow
twice and tab, then type a comma.

94
00:06:14.442 --> 00:06:16.810
Now it's very similar to the COUNTIFS.

95
00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:21.711
I need my criteria range,
which is my location and

96
00:06:21.711 --> 00:06:27.324
I need my criteria here,
which is Sydney, press enter.

97
00:06:27.324 --> 00:06:28.740
Double-click to copy down.

98
00:06:30.621 --> 00:06:35.823
So what we've seen there is that by
using Named Ranges in our calculations,

99
00:06:35.823 --> 00:06:38.668
we actually make them easier to create and

100
00:06:38.668 --> 00:06:42.750
the resulting function itself
much easier to understand.

101
00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:48.170
We also introduced two functions for
aggregating data, the COUNTIFS and

102
00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:48.915
the SUMIFS.

103
00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:52.300
Take a moment to check out the toolbox,

104
00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:57.123
which also introduces you to
the AVERAGEIFS, MAXIFS and MINIFS.
