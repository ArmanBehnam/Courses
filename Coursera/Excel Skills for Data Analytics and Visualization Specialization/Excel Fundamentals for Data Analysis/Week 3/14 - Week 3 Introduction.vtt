00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.675
Hi Nicky. How are you?

2
00:00:05.675 --> 00:00:08.675
Hi Prashan I'm doing
great and you?

3
00:00:08.675 --> 00:00:12.030
All the better for starting
another exciting week.

4
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.815
We've looked at text functions,

5
00:00:13.815 --> 00:00:16.015
date functions, what's next?

6
00:00:16.015 --> 00:00:17.480
Actually, we're going
to have a bit of

7
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.225
a break from functions this week,

8
00:00:19.225 --> 00:00:21.640
and we're going to focus
on cell referencing,

9
00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.530
and more specifically,
Named Rnamanges.

10
00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:27.110
That is really important
and up to now,

11
00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:28.580
all our formulas have worked

12
00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.710
fine with relative
cell referencing.

13
00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.305
But obviously that won't
always be the case.

14
00:00:33.305 --> 00:00:36.680
So Nicky, tell us a little
bit about cell referencing.

15
00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.300
Well, cell referencing
is how you refer

16
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.760
to as cell in a calculation.

17
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.340
So if I wanted to multiply

18
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.380
the value in B3 by
the value in C3,

19
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.880
my calculation refer to
the cells as B3 and C3.

20
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.445
If I then copy that formula down,

21
00:00:52.445 --> 00:00:56.285
the next calculation
will multiply B4 by C4.

22
00:00:56.285 --> 00:00:58.385
This is called
relative referencing,

23
00:00:58.385 --> 00:01:02.315
and this is why we can copy
calculations in Excel.

24
00:01:02.315 --> 00:01:06.170
The problem is that
sometimes we don't actually

25
00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.540
want to use relative positioning

26
00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.130
or relative cell referencing.

27
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.600
So if, for example,

28
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.940
I had a rate in D1 and I

29
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.535
wanted to multiply a whole
column by that rate,

30
00:01:16.535 --> 00:01:18.635
as I drag that calculation down,

31
00:01:18.635 --> 00:01:21.530
I don't want D1 to become D2, D3.

32
00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.870
I want a way to lock it in place.

33
00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:28.130
Now, what I do is I use an
absolute cell reference,

34
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.845
and we do this by putting a
dollar in front of the D,

35
00:01:30.845 --> 00:01:33.085
and a dollar in front of the one.

36
00:01:33.085 --> 00:01:35.120
There's a great keyboard shortcut

37
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.290
to put those dollars in,

38
00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.035
you just need to press
your "F4" function key.

39
00:01:39.035 --> 00:01:40.880
Some people find it confusing

40
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.485
that we need two dollar signs.

41
00:01:42.485 --> 00:01:44.935
Can you please
explain why this is?

42
00:01:44.935 --> 00:01:47.640
Yeah, sure it's a
really good question.

43
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.389
The dollar in front of the
column letter or the D,

44
00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:52.770
locks the column,

45
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.770
whereas the dollar in
front of the number,

46
00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.330
or in our example, the one,

47
00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:57.845
locks just the row.

48
00:01:57.845 --> 00:01:59.270
So if, for example, I

49
00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.130
just had a dollar
in front of the D,

50
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.370
if I dragged that
calculation across,

51
00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.175
it would stay D1, but
if I drag it down,

52
00:02:07.175 --> 00:02:09.320
it will become D1, D2, D3.

53
00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.070
This is what we call a
mixed cell reference,

54
00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:13.970
and obviously you can put
the dollar in front of

55
00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.615
the column or in front
of just the row.

56
00:02:16.615 --> 00:02:18.560
They're really handy
when you need to

57
00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.620
drag a calculation
down and across.

58
00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.560
But as well as
relative, absolute,

59
00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.960
and mixed references,
we have another way

60
00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.525
of referencing cells
called a Named Range.

61
00:02:29.525 --> 00:02:32.005
Can you please
explain what this is?

62
00:02:32.005 --> 00:02:33.930
Yes. As you say,

63
00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.040
a Named range is another
way of referencing a cell,

64
00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.835
and basically it's where you
give a cell a sensible name.

65
00:02:40.835 --> 00:02:42.620
So if I was there,

66
00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.855
I had a discount rate in cell E2,

67
00:02:44.855 --> 00:02:46.955
rather than referring
to it as E2,

68
00:02:46.955 --> 00:02:50.665
I could actually refer
to it as discount rate.

69
00:02:50.665 --> 00:02:54.410
That makes sense, but why
would we want to do this?

70
00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:55.730
Well, for one thing, it makes

71
00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.665
our formulas much
easy to understand,

72
00:02:57.665 --> 00:02:58.910
and we'll see in
the videos it also

73
00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.740
makes them much easier to create.

74
00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.230
Another advantage is
that Named Ranges give us

75
00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:04.880
an absolute cell
reference so we don't

76
00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.980
need to worry about the
dollars, which is nice.

77
00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.170
But actually the most
important reason

78
00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.530
is they support automation,

79
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.130
and actually that's
why they are one of

80
00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.815
the most important tools
in our Excel toolkit.

81
00:03:15.815 --> 00:03:18.200
So not just a nice to have,

82
00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.515
Named Ranges are a need to know.

83
00:03:20.515 --> 00:03:23.150
So how do we create
a Named Range?

84
00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.740
Well, there are few options.

85
00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:26.525
We're going to start
with a really easy one

86
00:03:26.525 --> 00:03:27.905
called the Name Box.

87
00:03:27.905 --> 00:03:30.785
We're then going to use a
tool called Define Name,

88
00:03:30.785 --> 00:03:33.630
which gives us a few more
options, and finally,

89
00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:34.820
we're going to look
at my favorite,

90
00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.350
which is Create from Selection,

91
00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:37.685
and this allows us to create

92
00:03:37.685 --> 00:03:40.235
multiple Named Ranges
simultaneously.

93
00:03:40.235 --> 00:03:42.770
What about if we want to
see what ranges you've

94
00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.645
created or changed them
or even delete them?

95
00:03:46.645 --> 00:03:48.660
So we're going to
look at a great tool

96
00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.130
called the name manager,

97
00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.500
which allows us to
do all these things,

98
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.310
and then we'll get stuck into
looking at how we actually

99
00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.975
use our Named Ranges to
simplify calculations.

100
00:03:58.975 --> 00:04:02.835
So are we going to do
some calculations?

101
00:04:02.835 --> 00:04:05.840
Yeah, we are. We're
going to look at

102
00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.900
two really exciting functions
called COUNTIFS and SUMIFS.

103
00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.365
They basically allow us to
summarize or aggregate data.

104
00:04:12.365 --> 00:04:13.970
In this context,
we are going to be

105
00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:15.875
using them to
demonstrate Named Ranges,

106
00:04:15.875 --> 00:04:17.960
but they are excellent
analysis tools.

107
00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:20.365
So I'm happy we're
sneaking them in here.

108
00:04:20.365 --> 00:04:23.040
Once we master
COUNTIFS and SUMIFS,

109
00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.885
we'll be able to use AVERAGEIFS,

110
00:04:24.885 --> 00:04:27.375
MAXIFS and MINIFS as well.

111
00:04:27.375 --> 00:04:29.640
One last question,
you mentioned that

112
00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.010
name ranges support automation,

113
00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:33.814
now that's really interesting.

114
00:04:33.814 --> 00:04:35.870
Can you explain this
further, please?

115
00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.575
Yeah. Well, when you
refer to a ranges B3-B9,

116
00:04:39.575 --> 00:04:41.300
it can only ever be those cells.

117
00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.209
So if I now add row
of data in row 10,

118
00:04:44.209 --> 00:04:45.350
my calculations are not going to

119
00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:46.720
pick up those new values.

120
00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.545
A Named Range can be redefined.

121
00:04:49.545 --> 00:04:51.435
So if we can find
a way to mitigate

122
00:04:51.435 --> 00:04:53.775
automatically pick up the
new values in row 10,

123
00:04:53.775 --> 00:04:56.030
our calculations
will keep working.

124
00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.160
We're going to look at
quite a tricky solution

125
00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.450
this week using
dynamic Named Ranges,

126
00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:01.790
but next week we'll see

127
00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:05.364
an even easier
solution using tables.

128
00:05:05.364 --> 00:05:09.405
Thanks Nicky. Our five
topics this week are,

129
00:05:09.405 --> 00:05:13.220
cell referencing and naming,
creating Named Ranges,

130
00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.525
managing Named Ranges,
calculations with Named Ranges,

131
00:05:17.525 --> 00:05:20.645
and then automating
processes with Named Ranges.

132
00:05:20.645 --> 00:05:22.040
Don't forget to download

133
00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.725
this week's exercise
files and work alongside.

134
00:05:24.725 --> 00:05:27.800
Take some time to check
out the toolbox and cement

135
00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.120
those skills with this week's

136
00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.265
really interesting
practice challenge.

137
00:05:31.265 --> 00:05:34.440
Now, it's over to you.
