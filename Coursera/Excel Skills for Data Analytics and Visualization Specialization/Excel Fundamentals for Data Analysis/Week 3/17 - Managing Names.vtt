00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.190
In this video, we're going
to look at how we can manage

2
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:12.210
our Named Ranges using a tool
called the Name Manager.

3
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.980
In the last video, we helped

4
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.945
Zara name each of the columns,

5
00:00:15.945 --> 00:00:18.375
but she's decided
that amount paid

6
00:00:18.375 --> 00:00:21.735
would be a better name
for her amount data.

7
00:00:21.735 --> 00:00:24.390
Now, what we don't
want to do is go and

8
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.495
create another named
range called Amount Paid.

9
00:00:27.495 --> 00:00:29.310
It won't replace the first,

10
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.810
it will be added as well,

11
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.760
and we'll end up with
two Named Ranges

12
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.140
looking at the same data,

13
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.155
which may cause confusion
and problems down the line.

14
00:00:37.155 --> 00:00:38.820
So what we're going to do,

15
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.120
is actually edit the
existing Named Range.

16
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.250
We do that by coming
to our "Formulas" tab,

17
00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.725
and in the Define Names group,

18
00:00:48.725 --> 00:00:51.935
clicking on our
"Name Manager" tool.

19
00:00:51.935 --> 00:00:53.690
If you hover over it, you see

20
00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.675
the keyboard shortcut
is "Ctrl+F3".

21
00:00:56.675 --> 00:00:58.815
I'm going to click on that,

22
00:00:58.815 --> 00:01:00.830
and similar to the name box,

23
00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.215
it gives us a list of
all the Named Ranges.

24
00:01:03.215 --> 00:01:04.460
But you can see it gives us

25
00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.565
a lot more information
like the values contained,

26
00:01:07.565 --> 00:01:10.885
the cells it refers
to, and the scope.

27
00:01:10.885 --> 00:01:15.425
It also gives us the option
to create a new Named Range,

28
00:01:15.425 --> 00:01:16.835
edit an existing one,

29
00:01:16.835 --> 00:01:18.835
or delete an existing one.

30
00:01:18.835 --> 00:01:22.060
Now, we want to edit
the amount Named Range.

31
00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:23.690
So making sure it's highlighted,

32
00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.000
we're going to click
on the "Edit" button,

33
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.850
and then we're just going to
click into the Name Box

34
00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.725
and type our underscore and paid.

35
00:01:32.725 --> 00:01:36.590
You'll notice we can also
change the cells it refers to,

36
00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.765
but we can't change the scope.

37
00:01:38.765 --> 00:01:41.815
So that's one thing you
have to get right upfront.

38
00:01:41.815 --> 00:01:46.470
Now click "Okay", and our
Named Range has been updated.

39
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.860
Any calculations that refer to

40
00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.695
this Named Range will
automatically pick up the change.

41
00:01:51.695 --> 00:01:55.000
So this won't impact our
calculations in any way.

42
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.125
The other thing we
can do, is create

43
00:01:57.125 --> 00:01:59.635
a brand new Named Range.

44
00:01:59.635 --> 00:02:01.940
Now, I'd like to create one that

45
00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.935
refers to my System_Date cell.

46
00:02:03.935 --> 00:02:06.215
So I'm going to click
the "New" button,

47
00:02:06.215 --> 00:02:08.810
but you'll see it
automatically picks

48
00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.635
up the values that I had
highlighted previously.

49
00:02:11.635 --> 00:02:16.740
So I'm going to change the
name to be System_Date,

50
00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.150
but then I'm going to change,

51
00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:26.380
the rate she refers
refers to, to be B2.

52
00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.215
I can also change the scope,

53
00:02:30.215 --> 00:02:33.170
so I'm going to do that so
you can see the difference.

54
00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.035
I'm going to make it
MC Invoice Report,

55
00:02:36.035 --> 00:02:38.555
and then I'm going
to say, "Okay",

56
00:02:38.555 --> 00:02:41.800
our new Named Range
has been added.

57
00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.440
Let's go and use that in a
formula and we'll see how

58
00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.210
the scope affects the Named
Range in our calculation.

59
00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.135
So we're just going to
click "Close" for a moment.

60
00:02:52.135 --> 00:02:56.760
Can I ask you to click into
"D2" and type "tomorrow",

61
00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.250
and then tab to E2.

62
00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.790
We're going to do a
little calculation

63
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.160
to work out tomorrow's date.

64
00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.255
So that's going to be "=".

65
00:03:04.255 --> 00:03:07.360
Click on your "System_date"

66
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:13.005
plus 1 and then press "Enter".

67
00:03:13.005 --> 00:03:14.770
Now remember, if our dates

68
00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.570
don't come up in
the correct format,

69
00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.490
we just come to our "Home" tab,

70
00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.230
come to our Number Formatting,

71
00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.240
I'm going to make
that a Short Date.

72
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.500
So that's looking fine.

73
00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.410
Now the next thing
we're going to look at,

74
00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.230
is what happens if we
delete a Named Range.

75
00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.330
So coming back to
our "Formulas" Tab,

76
00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.655
I'm going to come
to my Name Manager.

77
00:03:33.655 --> 00:03:36.910
I'm going to scroll down
until I get to System_date,

78
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.395
and I'm going to press "Delete".

79
00:03:39.395 --> 00:03:41.220
Excel is going to check,

80
00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.035
"Are you sure you
want to do this?"

81
00:03:43.035 --> 00:03:45.255
You actually do
need to be careful.

82
00:03:45.255 --> 00:03:47.445
But for now, we're
going to say "Okay",

83
00:03:47.445 --> 00:03:53.150
and "Close", you'll see my
formula immediately breaks.

84
00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.960
If you delete a Named Range

85
00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.045
that is being used
by a calculation,

86
00:03:58.045 --> 00:03:59.530
it will not replace

87
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.825
the Named Range with the
original cell reference.

88
00:04:01.825 --> 00:04:04.090
It will simply give
you a name error.

89
00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.840
So that's something to
be very cautious of.

90
00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.110
Now, in this case, we don't

91
00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:09.760
actually need that calculation,

92
00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.575
so I'm just going to remove it,

93
00:04:11.575 --> 00:04:16.060
but do be cautious when
deleting Named Ranges.

94
00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.800
Now one last little thing we're

95
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.765
going to look at in this video,

96
00:04:19.765 --> 00:04:22.705
while we know to go and look

97
00:04:22.705 --> 00:04:25.885
at Named Ranges in the Name
Box in the Name Manager,

98
00:04:25.885 --> 00:04:28.750
other people might not
know about these tools,

99
00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.685
and so it's handy
to know how we can

100
00:04:30.685 --> 00:04:33.670
document our named
ranges in the workbook.

101
00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.805
An Excel provides us with
a tool to do this as well.

102
00:04:36.805 --> 00:04:39.130
Just so we don't get in
the way of anything,

103
00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:43.475
I'm going to click into "Q5".

104
00:04:43.475 --> 00:04:46.455
I'm coming back to
our Define Names.

105
00:04:46.455 --> 00:04:48.330
We're going to come
to the Use in Formula

106
00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.610
and click the drop-down arrow,

107
00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.080
and right at the bottom,

108
00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.870
there's a Paste Names option
which we're going to select,

109
00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.870
and then we're going to
choose "Paste List".

110
00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:01.260
If I just double-click between

111
00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.270
the Q and the R to
widen that bit,

112
00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.060
there's our full list of

113
00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.510
Named Ranges as they
currently stand.

114
00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.825
This will not
automatically update,

115
00:05:09.825 --> 00:05:11.420
so it's just a snapshot,

116
00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:15.365
but it's very handy to quickly
document your Named Ranges.

117
00:05:15.365 --> 00:05:17.200
So two things we've
looked at there,

118
00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.300
the Paste Names and
the Name Manager,

119
00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.115
which will allow you to edit,

120
00:05:22.115 --> 00:05:25.760
delete, and even add
new Named Ranges.

121
00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.950
In the next video, we're going to

122
00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:29.810
start using our Named Ranges in

123
00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:31.910
our calculations and
then we'll start to

124
00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:35.460
see why they are so useful.
