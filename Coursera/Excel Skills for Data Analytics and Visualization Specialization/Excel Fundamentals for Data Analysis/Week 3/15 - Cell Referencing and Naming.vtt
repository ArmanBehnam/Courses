2
00:00:05.268 --> 00:00:10.843
In this video, we're going to revise
conventional cell referencing in Excel and

3
00:00:10.843 --> 00:00:14.820
introduce an exciting
alternative called Named Ranges.

4
00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:17.760
Now that our data is all transformed and

5
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.050
cleaned we're ready to start
performing calculations.

6
00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.290
And the first things I would like to
do is work out the late charge for

7
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.271
each of the overdue invoices.

8
00:00:27.271 --> 00:00:32.773
Late charge is calculated by taking
0.36% of the invoice amount and

9
00:00:32.773 --> 00:00:35.580
multiplying it by the days overdue.

10
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.172
So let's see how we do this.

11
00:00:38.172 --> 00:00:42.090
I'm going to click into M5 and
type "=".

12
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.960
We'll grab our Amount,
multiply that by our Over Due By,

13
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.960
and then times that by our Penalty Rate.

14
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.820
When we press enter,
there's our Late Charge.

15
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.720
But when I come to copy it down,
we have a problem.

16
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.436
Now, the reason for this is when
we create an Excel calculation and

17
00:01:04.436 --> 00:01:09.407
copy it down, the cells it's
referring to move down as well.

18
00:01:09.407 --> 00:01:11.815
This is called relative referencing and

19
00:01:11.815 --> 00:01:14.944
it's the reason we can
normally copy our formulas.

20
00:01:14.944 --> 00:01:22.745
But in the case of the N2, we didn't want
that to travel, we wanted that to stay N2.

21
00:01:22.745 --> 00:01:24.150
So how do we do this?

22
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.650
Well, one option would be to just
times the penalty rate in there.

23
00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.210
This is not a good option though.

24
00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.940
We really want to always retain
a single point of entry.

25
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.530
So in other words,
if we needed to change our rate,

26
00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.490
we would only change it in one place
rather than in loads of calculations.

27
00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.990
The other thing is we want our
sheets to be self-documenting.

28
00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.600
So it's good that we can
actually see the rate there

29
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.530
without having to go into our calculations
and see what rate is being used.

30
00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.190
So it really is good practice
to refer to the rate.

31
00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:04.920
What we need to do is just tell
Excel that that needs to stay fixed,

32
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.638
or what Excel calls absolute.

33
00:02:07.638 --> 00:02:11.789
And we do this by putting a dollar
in front of the column and

34
00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:17.330
a dollar in front of the row for
the cell that we want to stay locked.

35
00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.500
Now typing the dollars
will be very tedious.

36
00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.152
So instead we're going to
press F4 on our keyboards.

37
00:02:25.152 --> 00:02:30.790
On some computers,
you may need to press Fn+F4.

38
00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.410
You'll see that's put our dollars for
us and what that's saying is whether we drag

39
00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.220
the formula down or across,
N2 will stay fixed.

40
00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.401
If I press F4 again,
you'll see I've only locked the row.

41
00:02:43.401 --> 00:02:48.170
So this will fix it if I drag down but
not if I drag across.

42
00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.630
And of course I can press F4 again and
just lock the column.

43
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.910
If I press F4 one more time,
I'm back to relative.

44
00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:03.418
So four options, relative, absolute,
and two mixed cell references.

45
00:03:03.418 --> 00:03:05.792
The one we want in this
case is the absolute.

46
00:03:05.792 --> 00:03:10.004
So I'm going to press Enter,
click back on my formula,

47
00:03:10.004 --> 00:03:13.602
double-click to copy down, problem solved.

48
00:03:13.602 --> 00:03:16.158
And this is a good solution
that you will see used and

49
00:03:16.158 --> 00:03:18.190
you will probably need to use yourself.

50
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:23.660
The only problem is that when our
calculations get much more complex and

51
00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.810
we're pulling data from different sheets,
they become very messy and

52
00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.900
very hard to understand.

53
00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:35.680
So we're going to look at a much more
elegant solution called a Named Range.

54
00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.189
Let's delete those formulas because
we're going to redo it in a moment.

55
00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:40.875
So I'm just going to press Delete.

56
00:03:40.875 --> 00:03:44.823
And I'm going to come back up to N2.

57
00:03:44.823 --> 00:03:49.195
Wouldn't it be nice if rather
than calling that cell $N$2

58
00:03:49.195 --> 00:03:54.050
I could call it something
sensible like Penalty Rate.

59
00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.400
Well, that's exactly what I can do.

60
00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.680
And I do it by clicking on
the cell I want to name and

61
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:05.470
coming up to my name box, which is the
small box to the left of your formula bar.

62
00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.262
You'll see at the moment
that cell is called N2, but

63
00:04:09.262 --> 00:04:14.751
I'm going to click in there and I'm going
to change the name to Penalty_Rate.

64
00:04:14.751 --> 00:04:20.390
And when I'm finished typing, I'm going to
press Enter, don't forget that step.

65
00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:25.510
If I click away for a moment to find out
what Named Ranges exist in a workbook,

66
00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.764
you can come back to the name box and
click the drop-down list.

67
00:04:29.764 --> 00:04:30.518
They'll all be listed there.

68
00:04:30.518 --> 00:04:35.955
I can see my Penalty_Rate and if I click
on it, it actually navigates me to it.

69
00:04:35.955 --> 00:04:39.575
So the name box can be used to create
Named Ranges and to locate them.

70
00:04:41.385 --> 00:04:44.840
Let's now see that used
in our calculation.

71
00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.950
So back in N5, I'm going to type equals,
click on my Amount,

72
00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:55.430
times by my Overdue By,
times by - click on my rate.

73
00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.920
But this time you'll see
it uses the Named Range.

74
00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.350
And because that name
refers to specific cell,

75
00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.000
I'm automatically getting
an absolute cell reference.

76
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.090
So I press Enter, I copy my formula down.

77
00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:12.970
It works perfectly.

78
00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:17.080
It's easier to understand and
I didn't have to worry about the dollars.

79
00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.878
You probably realized that there were some
rules about how we name our ranges and

80
00:05:22.878 --> 00:05:25.019
I'll just quickly run through those.

81
00:05:25.019 --> 00:05:30.093
The name can be up to 255 characters long.

82
00:05:30.093 --> 00:05:33.213
It must start with a letter or
an underscore so

83
00:05:33.213 --> 00:05:38.069
you couldn't have 2019Sales,
you have to have Sales2019.

84
00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:44.920
It can consist of any combination of
letters, numbers, and underscores but

85
00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:50.270
no spaces, no hyphens, and most
punctuation characters won't be accepted.

86
00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:52.690
So just stay with the letters,
numbers, and underscores.

87
00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.046
They have to be unique,
usually within the workbook,

88
00:05:58.046 --> 00:06:02.073
although we will look at an exception
to that later on this week.

89
00:06:02.073 --> 00:06:07.108
And slightly more subtly,
they can't be a cell reference.

90
00:06:07.108 --> 00:06:11.422
Now, of course, you wouldn't want
to call your Named Range N6.

91
00:06:11.422 --> 00:06:15.750
But here's a mistake
that's quite easy to make.

92
00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:22.471
I've selected these values and I'm going
to name this range Top10, looks all right.

93
00:06:22.471 --> 00:06:26.914
When I press Enter,
can you see the problem?

94
00:06:26.914 --> 00:06:29.367
Top10 is in fact a cell reference.

95
00:06:29.367 --> 00:06:34.210
Any one to three letters followed by
a number is going to be a cell reference.

96
00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:37.810
So solve the problem by
putting an underscore.

97
00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:40.858
All right, I'm going to press
Ctrl+Home just to hop back.

98
00:06:40.858 --> 00:06:45.755
So just to recap then to name a cell,
we click on the cell we want to name,

99
00:06:45.755 --> 00:06:49.760
come to our name box,
type in the name, and press Enter.

100
00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:54.410
In the next video, we're going to
look at some other options for

101
00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:55.950
creating Named Ranges.
