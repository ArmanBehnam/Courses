00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:07.980
In this video, we're
going to explore some of

2
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.190
the different options for
creating Named Ranges.

3
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.650
Very shortly, Zara is
going start performing

4
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.635
calculations using
entire columns of data,

5
00:00:16.635 --> 00:00:18.615
and to make her life
a little easier,

6
00:00:18.615 --> 00:00:20.565
she would like to name them.

7
00:00:20.565 --> 00:00:22.710
In the previous
video, we saw how we

8
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.645
could name a single cell.

9
00:00:24.645 --> 00:00:26.370
Well, the process
is very much the

10
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.710
same for naming an entire column.

11
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.110
We start by selecting the column.

12
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:32.850
I'm going to come
to my late charge.

13
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.080
But note, I'm not including

14
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.575
the heading because it's
not part of the data.

15
00:00:36.575 --> 00:00:37.940
To select all the data,

16
00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.000
we're going to press
"Control+ Shift+ Down Arrow",

17
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.560
and then we're going to come to

18
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.130
our Name box as we did
in the previous video,

19
00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:52.830
and I'm going to call this
"Late_Charge" and press Enter.

20
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.190
What has happened
is we haven't given

21
00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.199
each cell the name Late_Charge,

22
00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:02.190
instead we've named the
entire column Late_Charge.

23
00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.300
So that was using
our Name Box again,

24
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.025
which is quick and easy.

25
00:01:07.025 --> 00:01:08.810
But there are some
other alternatives

26
00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.600
which give us more options,

27
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.080
and we'll find these on the
"Formulas" tab of the ribbon.

28
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.545
If you have a look in the
"Defined Names" group,

29
00:01:18.545 --> 00:01:20.630
these are all of the
tools for working

30
00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.285
with Named Ranges, and
there're quite a few.

31
00:01:23.285 --> 00:01:25.220
The next one we're
going to look at

32
00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.275
is called Define Name,

33
00:01:27.275 --> 00:01:30.155
and again, this allows us
to create a Named Range.

34
00:01:30.155 --> 00:01:33.665
So let's do our Overdue
By data this time.

35
00:01:33.665 --> 00:01:36.070
I'm going to click into M5,

36
00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.970
then press "Control+ 
Shift+ Down Arrow".

37
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.810
But this time, I'm going
to press "Define Name".

38
00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.345
This is the "New Name" dialog,

39
00:01:45.345 --> 00:01:46.940
and you'll see it's picked up

40
00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.695
the label for us automatically.

41
00:01:48.695 --> 00:01:50.735
So that saves us a bit of typing.

42
00:01:50.735 --> 00:01:52.490
I could adjust the range it's

43
00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.200
referring to, which is handy.

44
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.060
But the main reason
for looking at

45
00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.285
this tool is the scope.

46
00:01:58.285 --> 00:02:00.590
In the last video, I
said that typically

47
00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.140
the scope was the whole workbook.

48
00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.940
In other words, the
Named Range had to

49
00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.195
be unique within the workbook.

50
00:02:07.195 --> 00:02:09.290
But if you wanted to have two

51
00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:11.810
Named Ranges the same
in different sheets,

52
00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.820
you could change the scope and

53
00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.175
restrict it just
to a single sheet.

54
00:02:16.175 --> 00:02:18.800
This is not usually desirable,

55
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.935
so we can leave it as workbook,

56
00:02:20.935 --> 00:02:23.665
and we're just going
to press "Okay".

57
00:02:23.665 --> 00:02:25.880
If I come back to my name box,

58
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.135
you can see that Named
Range has been added.

59
00:02:29.135 --> 00:02:32.735
We still have quite a few
columns to do, though,

60
00:02:32.735 --> 00:02:36.140
and this can be time consuming
if we did them one by one.

61
00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.020
So now we're going to
look at my favorite tool,

62
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.870
which is "Create from Selection".

63
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.335
This allows us to create
multiple Named Ranges

64
00:02:45.335 --> 00:02:50.260
simultaneously using the labels
already in the workbook.

65
00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.580
So how do we do this?

66
00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.685
We're going to start
by clicking into A4,

67
00:02:55.685 --> 00:02:59.165
and dragging across to
select all of our labels.

68
00:02:59.165 --> 00:03:03.370
I know, I specifically
told you not to do that.

69
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.740
But these are not going
to be part of the range.

70
00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:07.880
We're just selecting them,

71
00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.715
so it knows what to
call each range.

72
00:03:10.715 --> 00:03:12.620
Then, again, we're going
to press "Control+

73
00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.865
Shift+ Down Arrow" to
select all our data.

74
00:03:15.865 --> 00:03:17.790
If I come up to "Create From

75
00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.840
Selection" and hover
over it for a moment,

76
00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.104
you'll see the keyboard
shortcut is "Control+ Shift+ F3"

77
00:03:23.104 --> 00:03:24.560
and the more you use this tool,

78
00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.825
the more likely you
are to remember that.

79
00:03:26.825 --> 00:03:30.160
But for now, we're just
going to click on the tool,

80
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.575
and I need to explain
what it's doing here.

81
00:03:34.575 --> 00:03:36.790
Is saying, "Do you want me to use

82
00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.385
the labels in the top row
to name each column?"

83
00:03:39.385 --> 00:03:41.950
Yes, we do. "Do
you want me to use

84
00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.860
the labels in the left
column to name each row?"

85
00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.710
No, we don't. So Excel will

86
00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:51.190
take a pretty educated guess
based on where it finds text.

87
00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.810
But if you do have text
in your first column,

88
00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.040
don't forget to untick that.

89
00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.205
Now we're going to say "Okay".

90
00:03:59.205 --> 00:04:02.890
If I come back to my name box,

91
00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.135
you'll see each of those
Named Ranges has been added,

92
00:04:07.135 --> 00:04:10.220
and if I select
amount for example,

93
00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.200
it has named the entire column,

94
00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.545
but has not included the heading.

95
00:04:15.545 --> 00:04:18.925
So three options
for naming ranges.

96
00:04:18.925 --> 00:04:21.905
The Name Box is ideal if
you quickly need to name

97
00:04:21.905 --> 00:04:25.765
a large range or a single cell
that doesn't have a label.

98
00:04:25.765 --> 00:04:28.655
The Define Name is good
if you need to name

99
00:04:28.655 --> 00:04:32.420
a single range and you need
that additional scope option,

100
00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.640
and the Create From Selection is

101
00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.830
our fastest option when you need

102
00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.915
to create multiple Named Ranges

103
00:04:38.915 --> 00:04:41.620
using labels already
in the workbook.

104
00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.045
Don't worry if you've
made some mistakes.

105
00:04:44.045 --> 00:04:45.425
In the next video,

106
00:04:45.425 --> 00:04:47.000
we're going to look
at how we can use

107
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.810
the Name Manager to edit
and delete Named Ranges.
