00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.440
In this video,
we're going to take

2
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.040
some time to understand
how dates work in Excel,

3
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.020
and to get to know a few of

4
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.720
the more common date functions.

5
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.390
The first thing we need
to understand about

6
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.940
dates in Excel is
that they are just,

7
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.840
in fact, numbers formatted
to look like dates.

8
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.344
Let's have a look at an example.

9
00:00:27.344 --> 00:00:30.500
I'm going to click
into D2 and I'm

10
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.430
going to type the number
1 and press "Enter",

11
00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.175
and well, I get the number 1.

12
00:00:36.175 --> 00:00:39.680
But what I would like you
to notice is in the number

13
00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.280
formatting section the
format is set to general.

14
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.380
That basically means no
format has been applied.

15
00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:52.020
If I click the dropdown and
change that to short date,

16
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.695
it changes to the
1st of January 1900.

17
00:00:55.695 --> 00:01:00.075
Interesting. If I now
type the number 2,

18
00:01:00.075 --> 00:01:03.900
now remembering that this is
now formatted to be a date,

19
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.945
and press "Enter", I get
the 2nd of January 1900.

20
00:01:08.945 --> 00:01:10.685
So you get the idea,

21
00:01:10.685 --> 00:01:13.250
dates are just the number of days

22
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.640
since the 1st of January 1900.

23
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.200
This has two very
large implications.

24
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.820
The first is, we
now understand why

25
00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.370
our date sometimes
come up as numbers,

26
00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.430
and our numbers sometimes
come up as dates,

27
00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.660
and to fix the
problem is very easy.

28
00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.310
All we need to do is come back to

29
00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.350
our number format and switch it

30
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.005
back to the format
you actually want.

31
00:01:39.005 --> 00:01:42.320
More importantly
however, it means we

32
00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.350
can perform arithmetic
operations with dates,

33
00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.245
and this is where it gets
much more interesting.

34
00:01:48.245 --> 00:01:50.810
So I'm just going to delete this,

35
00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.875
and we're going to click into B2.

36
00:01:53.875 --> 00:01:56.990
Now, very often, before we can

37
00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.465
perform any calculations
with dates,

38
00:01:59.465 --> 00:02:02.440
we need to know what
the current date is.

39
00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.310
So if I were to work
out how old somebody

40
00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.080
was or how overdue
an invoice was,

41
00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.390
I have to have a reference point,

42
00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.340
but obviously, that
reference point

43
00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.040
is going to change tomorrow.

44
00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.135
So I need some way of Excel

45
00:02:17.135 --> 00:02:20.450
automatically working
out what the date is,

46
00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.885
and there are two functions
that can help us with this.

47
00:02:23.885 --> 00:02:25.250
I'm going to ask you,

48
00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.130
please click on the
Formulas tool bar,

49
00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.405
and the first group is
our function library.

50
00:02:32.405 --> 00:02:34.940
Now, this is great because it has

51
00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.820
a list of all the
Excel functions.

52
00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.920
So if you have
forgotten what they're

53
00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.085
called or you want to see
what else is available,

54
00:02:43.085 --> 00:02:46.240
you can always come back
here and have a look.

55
00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.880
If we have a look at the
Text functions, for example,

56
00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.890
you can see all
the text functions

57
00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.660
we worked with last week,

58
00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.060
as well as a few additional ones

59
00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.390
you might want to investigate.

60
00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.005
This week, we're looking
at date functions.

61
00:03:02.005 --> 00:03:05.120
I'm going to come
to date and time,

62
00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.380
and again, you'll see

63
00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.195
quite a rich selection
available for us.

64
00:03:10.195 --> 00:03:13.580
Now, the two functions
that will help us work out

65
00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.850
today's date are
the NOW function.

66
00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.950
If I hover over there,

67
00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.470
you'll see it returns
the current date and

68
00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.800
time formatted as date and time.

69
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.585
So that will give us
the date and time.

70
00:03:29.585 --> 00:03:32.180
If you just want the date,

71
00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.240
then you're better off
using the TODAY function,

72
00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.260
and that's the one we're
going to click on.

73
00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.040
So let's click on "Today",

74
00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.145
and a little message box

75
00:03:43.145 --> 00:03:47.300
appears telling us
that this is volatile.

76
00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.580
There are a few Excel
functions that are volatile.

77
00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.060
All it means is that when

78
00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.129
there is a change
in the workbook,

79
00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:58.770
this function will recalculate.

80
00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.050
If you have millions
of this function,

81
00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.450
that could cause
performance overhead.

82
00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.980
But as we never need

83
00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.590
more than one day
function in a workbook,

84
00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.660
it's not a problem at all.

85
00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.080
So you can just press
"Enter" or click "Okay",

86
00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.300
and there's today's date.

87
00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:20.330
Obviously, if you're
working alongside me,

88
00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:23.615
you won't have got the
exact same date as mine,

89
00:04:23.615 --> 00:04:25.160
you would have got whatever

90
00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.240
the date is where
you are right now.

91
00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.360
So just to recap,

92
00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.500
the NOW function returns
the date and time,

93
00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.965
the TODAY function
returns today's date.

94
00:04:36.965 --> 00:04:39.995
When I open up this
workbook tomorrow,

95
00:04:39.995 --> 00:04:42.990
it will actually have
tomorrow's date.

96
00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.720
Last week we also had a look at

97
00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.110
functions for separating text.

98
00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.150
However, we can't use

99
00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.645
those same functions for
separating out our dates.

100
00:04:53.645 --> 00:04:58.329
So if I want to just extract
the day or just the year,

101
00:04:58.329 --> 00:05:01.074
the LEFT and the RIGHT functions

102
00:05:01.085 --> 00:05:03.590
are not going to help me because,

103
00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:06.155
actually, this is just a number.

104
00:05:06.155 --> 00:05:08.090
Excel provided us with

105
00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.280
three date functions specifically

106
00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.290
for separating our dates.

107
00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:15.519
If we come back to our
Date & Time functions,

108
00:05:15.519 --> 00:05:19.710
you'll see we have
DAY, MONTH, and YEAR,

109
00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.815
and these basically perform

110
00:05:21.815 --> 00:05:24.875
a similar function
to the LEFT, RIGHT

111
00:05:24.875 --> 00:05:28.520
and MID functions, but
they extract the day,

112
00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:32.035
the month or the
year as a number.

113
00:05:32.035 --> 00:05:34.385
Let's see how this work.

114
00:05:34.385 --> 00:05:37.320
So I'm going to come into L5,

115
00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:43.350
and I'm going to type
"=DAY" and Tab.

116
00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:47.195
Now, the argument
it needs is a date.

117
00:05:47.195 --> 00:05:51.320
It says serial number which
is a little confusing,

118
00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.965
but we now know that dates
are, in fact, numbers.

119
00:05:54.965 --> 00:05:58.660
So we're going to
click on Invoice Date

120
00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:00.660
and press "Enter",

121
00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:04.826
and you can see what's
returned: the second.

122
00:06:04.826 --> 00:06:08.140
If I double-click,
copy that down,

123
00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:12.445
I can now see the day on
which I was invoiced.

124
00:06:12.445 --> 00:06:15.860
Now very similar, and
I'll just do them in

125
00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.300
their cells to the right to

126
00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.850
demonstrate you have
your month function.

127
00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:28.120
This will return
the month number.

128
00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:31.695
So I'm expecting a three here,

129
00:06:31.695 --> 00:06:33.825
I'm just going to press "Tab",

130
00:06:33.825 --> 00:06:35.700
and you can see that as

131
00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:41.110
my MONTH number and the YEAR
work very much the same way.

132
00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:45.990
So "=year", click
on my "Invoice Date",

133
00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:49.930
press "Enter", and
there's my 2020.

134
00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:54.575
So three functions which allow
us to separate out dates;

135
00:06:54.575 --> 00:06:58.420
DAY, MONTH and YEAR.

136
00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:00.335
In the next video,

137
00:07:00.335 --> 00:07:02.270
we're going to look
at how we perform

138
00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:06.140
the reverse of this
operation and given a day,

139
00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:10.460
month, and a year
create a valid date.
