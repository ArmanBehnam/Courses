00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.830
In this video, we're
going to continue

2
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.545
looking at doing
calculations with dates,

3
00:00:10.545 --> 00:00:12.420
but we're going to introduce

4
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.180
two really exciting
date functions,

5
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.275
the end of month (EOMONTH)
and the end date (EDATE).

6
00:00:19.275 --> 00:00:23.550
So coming back to our
example in the last video,

7
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.679
we looked at how
we could calculate

8
00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:29.040
the due date by just
adding six working days.

9
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.150
In reality, life is not
always that simple.

10
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.530
Very often invoice due
dates are calculated

11
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.820
from the start of

12
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.775
the next month or
exactly a month after.

13
00:00:42.775 --> 00:00:47.870
So let's say that what
someone actually needs is to

14
00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.700
calculate the due date

15
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.480
five working days
into the next month.

16
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.255
The function that can
help us with this,

17
00:00:56.255 --> 00:00:59.280
is the end of month function.

18
00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.825
It will be at the
end of the month,

19
00:01:02.825 --> 00:01:05.600
after certain number
of months for

20
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.000
any given dates.
Let's have a look.

21
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.725
So clicking into E5,

22
00:01:12.725 --> 00:01:18.980
we just type "=eo"
and select EOMONTH.

23
00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.870
Now, we have to give it

24
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.285
a start date and
that's going to be

25
00:01:23.285 --> 00:01:27.915
our invoice date
and then a comma.

26
00:01:27.915 --> 00:01:32.195
Now, we can specify a certain
number of months before.

27
00:01:32.195 --> 00:01:34.700
So for example, if I type minus

28
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.085
one that will give me the
last date in February,

29
00:01:39.085 --> 00:01:44.135
if I add one that will give
me the last date in April,

30
00:01:44.135 --> 00:01:45.830
but I actually want

31
00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.580
the last date of the
end of this month.

32
00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.590
So I'm just going to put a zero.

33
00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:58.160
You can see, it gives
me the 31st of March.

34
00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.740
Now, I've got the
end of the month.

35
00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.465
All I need to do is add
my five working days on.

36
00:02:05.465 --> 00:02:08.060
We already know
the function to do

37
00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.610
that and that's our
WORKDAY function.

38
00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:17.980
I'll just go back after the
equal sign type in WORKDAY.

39
00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:25.200
So that's our start and we're
going to add five to that.

40
00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:30.620
When I press Enter and copy down,

41
00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.275
you can see in every case

42
00:02:33.275 --> 00:02:35.825
it's giving me the
first working day,

43
00:02:35.825 --> 00:02:38.800
five days into the next month

44
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.289
and that's our EOMONTH function.

45
00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:45.110
Now, the other one that's really

46
00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.829
handy is the EDATE function.

47
00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:52.970
What this allows us to
do is add a number of

48
00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.850
months or subtract a number
of months from a given date.

49
00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.070
Let's have a look
at it very simply.

50
00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.365
So in this situation,

51
00:03:03.365 --> 00:03:05.960
our invoices are going to be due

52
00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.650
exactly a month after
the invoice date.

53
00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:17.610
I'm going to click into
E5 and type "=EDATE".

54
00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.805
Again, we must give it

55
00:03:20.805 --> 00:03:26.990
our start date which is our
invoice date and a comma.

56
00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:29.840
Now again, we can add or

57
00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.755
subtract a certain
number of months.

58
00:03:32.755 --> 00:03:35.645
I want to add exactly one month.

59
00:03:35.645 --> 00:03:40.070
That gives me exactly a
month after my invoice date.

60
00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.890
When I copy it down, however,

61
00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:44.960
we're back to our problem of

62
00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.300
having Saturdays and Sundays.

63
00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.700
So we still need
to convert this to

64
00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.070
the next available work date.

65
00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:55.070
There's, however, once
more restriction with

66
00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:58.330
the WORKDAY function and
I'm going to demonstrate.

67
00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.510
We only want to add a day
if it's a non-work day,

68
00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.920
so I really want to add
zero days in this case.

69
00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.414
The problem is if you
put zero as your value,

70
00:04:10.414 --> 00:04:13.490
it does not affect
any of the dates.

71
00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:16.129
So we have to add or subtract

72
00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:20.180
at least one when working
with the WORKDAY function.

73
00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.675
How do we get around
this? Well, simple.

74
00:04:23.675 --> 00:04:26.620
We've got to put one on here.

75
00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.450
So what we're going
to do is we're going

76
00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:32.540
to subtract one from here first.

77
00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.930
What that will do is
subtract one from

78
00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.755
the EDATE calculation
and then add one.

79
00:04:40.755 --> 00:04:44.100
If that's not a work day add

80
00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.985
any others it needs to
make it a working day.

81
00:04:47.985 --> 00:04:50.830
Let's see that work.

82
00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.554
So you'll see this didn't change.

83
00:04:54.554 --> 00:04:57.555
It is still the
second of the fourth.

84
00:04:57.555 --> 00:04:59.845
When I copy down,

85
00:04:59.845 --> 00:05:02.510
all the non-working days have now

86
00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:05.375
been converted to work days.

87
00:05:05.375 --> 00:05:07.550
So there's a little
bonus trick on

88
00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.130
working with the
WORKDAY function.

89
00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:13.480
So two functions we've
looked at in this video.

90
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.455
They are the end of
month and the end date.

91
00:05:17.455 --> 00:05:19.250
This week we've looked at

92
00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:20.660
a really great selection of

93
00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.195
functions for working
with our dates.

94
00:05:23.195 --> 00:05:25.475
To help get proficient in these,

95
00:05:25.475 --> 00:05:26.990
I'd encourage you to try out

96
00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.730
this week's practice challenge.
