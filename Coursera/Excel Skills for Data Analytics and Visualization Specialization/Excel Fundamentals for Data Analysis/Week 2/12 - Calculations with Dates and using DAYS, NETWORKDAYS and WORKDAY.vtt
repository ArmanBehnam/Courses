00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.400
In this video, we're going to
look at how we can perform

2
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.560
calculations with dates and

3
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.050
some of the functions
that can help us.

4
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.930
The first thing
Zara needs to do is

5
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.110
work out when the invoice
are actually due.

6
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.000
Now for argument's sake,

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.275
let's say they were due six
days after the invoice date.

8
00:00:25.275 --> 00:00:30.375
All she'd need to do is
click in E5 type "=",

9
00:00:30.375 --> 00:00:33.945
click on the invoice
date and add six.

10
00:00:33.945 --> 00:00:36.795
Because dates are
really just numbers,

11
00:00:36.795 --> 00:00:39.179
you can work with
them like numbers,

12
00:00:39.179 --> 00:00:41.535
and there's our due date.

13
00:00:41.535 --> 00:00:44.475
Let's double-click
to copy that down,

14
00:00:44.475 --> 00:00:46.490
and you can do subtractions with

15
00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.345
dates in exactly the same way.

16
00:00:49.345 --> 00:00:52.665
So I'm going to click into M5,

17
00:00:52.665 --> 00:00:55.325
I am going to work out how much

18
00:00:55.325 --> 00:00:58.100
our invoice is overdue by.

19
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.595
So I'm going to type "=",

20
00:01:00.595 --> 00:01:03.905
going to take our Payment
Date and subtract

21
00:01:03.905 --> 00:01:07.905
our Due Date, and there you go.

22
00:01:07.905 --> 00:01:12.140
There's a function we can use
to subtract days as well.

23
00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.570
It's called the DAYS function.

24
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.780
If I click into M5 and
type "=D-A-Y",

25
00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.330
and make sure I choose DAYS,

26
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.625
plural, I specify
my end date first.

27
00:01:28.625 --> 00:01:31.960
So that's going to
be my payment date

28
00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.100
and then my due date.

29
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.540
You can see I get
exactly the same answer

30
00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.675
and I'll double-click
to copy that down.

31
00:01:41.675 --> 00:01:44.645
Now, coming back to our due date,

32
00:01:44.645 --> 00:01:47.000
let's just check
something and that is

33
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.215
what day those payments
are falling on.

34
00:01:50.215 --> 00:01:53.730
So I'm going to click on F and

35
00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.110
press "Control, Shift, Plus"
to insert another column.

36
00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.425
You can also use
your Insert, too,

37
00:02:01.425 --> 00:02:03.170
and just a reminder,

38
00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.100
we can use our TEXT function.

39
00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.240
I'm going to click "Due Date".

40
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.955
Remember we need to type quotes,

41
00:02:11.955 --> 00:02:15.965
"DDD" close your quotes,

42
00:02:15.965 --> 00:02:18.620
and enter to get the day of

43
00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.800
the week and you'll
see we have a problem.

44
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.785
A lot of these due
dates are falling

45
00:02:24.785 --> 00:02:27.305
on Saturdays and Sundays,

46
00:02:27.305 --> 00:02:31.535
which in Australia
are non-working days.

47
00:02:31.535 --> 00:02:34.895
Very often for these
types of calculations,

48
00:02:34.895 --> 00:02:38.585
you need to take working
days into account,

49
00:02:38.585 --> 00:02:41.045
and there's a function
that can help us.

50
00:02:41.045 --> 00:02:43.590
It's called the WORKDAY function.

51
00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.660
Let's now change our
example to say that

52
00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.700
the due date is actually

53
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.920
six working days after
the invoice date.

54
00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.050
So clicking back into E5,

55
00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:04.570
I'm going to type "=
W-O-R-K" and choose WORKDAY.

56
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.375
My start date is still
my invoice date,

57
00:03:08.375 --> 00:03:11.780
but this time I want to
add six working days,

58
00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.400
so it's actually going to skip

59
00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.680
the weekends when I press Enter.

60
00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.840
You see that has
worked beautifully.

61
00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.350
No Saturdays or Sundays showing.

62
00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.615
Now, obviously for
different countries

63
00:03:26.615 --> 00:03:28.340
and different organizations,

64
00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.645
Saturday and Sunday are not
always the non-working days.

65
00:03:32.645 --> 00:03:34.265
So Excel offers us

66
00:03:34.265 --> 00:03:37.115
another function
similar to the WORKDAY,

67
00:03:37.115 --> 00:03:39.935
but called Workday International.

68
00:03:39.935 --> 00:03:42.995
This will allow you
to actually specify

69
00:03:42.995 --> 00:03:46.300
what your work week
actually looks like.

70
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.840
So typing "Workday
International",

71
00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.935
I'm going to click my
invoice date and a comma,

72
00:03:53.935 --> 00:03:57.395
my days still six but next,

73
00:03:57.395 --> 00:04:00.290
for argument's sake,
let's say we don't

74
00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.815
work on Sundays or Tuesdays.

75
00:04:03.815 --> 00:04:08.435
You see options down here
that may fit your business,

76
00:04:08.435 --> 00:04:11.195
but if it doesn't,
there's another option.

77
00:04:11.195 --> 00:04:13.385
You can actually give it a code,

78
00:04:13.385 --> 00:04:15.830
and the code looks like this.

79
00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:19.430
Open your double
quotes and then you

80
00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.820
need to type seven
zeroes or ones;

81
00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.075
one representing
a non-working day

82
00:04:26.075 --> 00:04:29.830
and zero representing a workday.

83
00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.490
Excel starts with Monday.

84
00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.235
So in our example,

85
00:04:34.235 --> 00:04:35.690
Monday is a working day,

86
00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.535
so we put zero,

87
00:04:37.535 --> 00:04:42.590
Tuesday non-working
day so one, Wednesday,

88
00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.890
Thursday, Friday,
Saturday zeroes,

89
00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:48.335
and one for Sunday.

90
00:04:48.335 --> 00:04:52.170
Close your double
quotes and enter.

91
00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:55.170
You'll see our due
date has moved to one

92
00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:59.450
after the Tuesday because
Tuesday is a non-working day,

93
00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:01.910
so I'll just copy that down.

94
00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:05.000
Wait, there's still one problem.

95
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.020
I happen to know
that in Australia,

96
00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.605
the 10th of April
is Easter Friday,

97
00:05:12.605 --> 00:05:15.890
and that's actually
a public holiday.

98
00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:19.370
The great news is
that the WORKDAY and

99
00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:21.650
the WORKDAY International
functions will

100
00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.980
allow us to take
holidays into account.

101
00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.650
I'm just going to come to E6 for

102
00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.845
a moment and change
just this one.

103
00:05:30.845 --> 00:05:33.350
When I double-click,
you'll see at

104
00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:36.725
the end it allows me
to specify holidays,

105
00:05:36.725 --> 00:05:38.780
but what I can do is

106
00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.360
just type the date
as I normally would.

107
00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.014
Because remember, dates
are actually numbers.

108
00:05:44.014 --> 00:05:45.590
So one way of solving

109
00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:49.250
this problem is to
use a DATE function.

110
00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.265
So I'm going to put in date,

111
00:05:52.265 --> 00:05:55.160
the year is 2020,

112
00:05:55.160 --> 00:06:02.070
the month is April and Easter
Friday falls on the 10th.

113
00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:05.230
Close my brackets and

114
00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:07.850
that has taken the
holiday into account.

115
00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:10.564
The problem is Saturday, Sunday,

116
00:06:10.564 --> 00:06:13.220
and Easter Monday
are also holidays.

117
00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.590
To have to start typing them

118
00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:18.620
all in is really
going to be a pain.

119
00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.720
So a better way of dealing with

120
00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.210
holidays is to actually have them

121
00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:24.830
listed somewhere else in

122
00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:28.400
your workbook and then
just select them,

123
00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.220
and that's what
we're going to do.

124
00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:35.015
So we're going to come to E5,

125
00:06:35.015 --> 00:06:39.950
double-click and right at
the end of my double quotes,

126
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:41.824
but before my brackets,

127
00:06:41.824 --> 00:06:44.230
I'm going to type a comma,

128
00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:47.000
and I've got the holidays in

129
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.250
the New South Wales
holiday sheet.

130
00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:55.260
I'm just going to
select all those dates.

131
00:06:55.260 --> 00:07:01.140
So I can copy the formula down
and then just press Enter.

132
00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:05.315
It hasn't affected
this first date,

133
00:07:05.315 --> 00:07:07.670
but when I double-click
to copy down,

134
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:09.410
you see this is actually being

135
00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:12.205
pushed out to the
next working day.

136
00:07:12.205 --> 00:07:13.865
That's not a holiday,

137
00:07:13.865 --> 00:07:16.460
which is Wednesday.
Really clever.

138
00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:19.145
Now on the other
side of the coin,

139
00:07:19.145 --> 00:07:21.500
if we need to subtract
working days,

140
00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:24.325
we have our NETWORKDAYS function.

141
00:07:24.325 --> 00:07:26.850
So let's come back to our Overdue

142
00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:31.970
By and let's work out how
many days it's overdue by.

143
00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:34.985
I'm going to type

144
00:07:34.985 --> 00:07:39.260
"=N-E-T". You'll see again

145
00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.980
there's a NETWOWRKDAYS or a
NETWORKDAYS International.

146
00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:45.935
They work pretty much
like the workdays.

147
00:07:45.935 --> 00:07:49.235
We'll just use NETWORKDAYS
for simplicity.

148
00:07:49.235 --> 00:07:50.945
Our start date now,

149
00:07:50.945 --> 00:07:54.200
and this time notice we're
putting a start date first,

150
00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:56.960
that's going to be our due date,

151
00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:01.070
our end date is going
to be our payment date,

152
00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:04.970
and our holidays begin
to specify that again.

153
00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:07.730
You can see it has adjusted

154
00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:10.895
to only show us how
many working days,

155
00:08:10.895 --> 00:08:14.035
not including holidays
it is overdue by.

156
00:08:14.035 --> 00:08:17.210
So quite a few functions
we've looked at here.

157
00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:20.885
The DAYS function for
subtracting two dates,

158
00:08:20.885 --> 00:08:25.220
then WORKDAYS and Workday
International for

159
00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:29.660
adding a certain number of
workdays and NETWORKDAYS,

160
00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:31.940
and NETWORKDAYS International for

161
00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:34.805
subtracting a certain
number of days.

162
00:08:34.805 --> 00:08:37.340
This business case only really

163
00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:39.760
required us to work with days.

164
00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:42.110
But if you need to
work with years,

165
00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:43.550
for example, there's

166
00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:46.700
a fantastic function
called YEARFRAC.

167
00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:49.985
We've included this
in the toolbox,

168
00:08:49.985 --> 00:08:53.220
which I'd encourage
you to check out.
