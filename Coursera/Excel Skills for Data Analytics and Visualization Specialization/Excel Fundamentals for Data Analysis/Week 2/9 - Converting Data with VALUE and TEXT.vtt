00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.920
In this video, we are
going to learn about

2
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.750
two Excel functions that can

3
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.315
help us convert data in Excel.

4
00:00:12.315 --> 00:00:16.305
Last week we helped Zara
sort out the amount field,

5
00:00:16.305 --> 00:00:19.575
so they are all showing
as valid numbers.

6
00:00:19.575 --> 00:00:23.130
What Zara needs to do
now is add those all

7
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.570
up so she can compare the
total to the other report.

8
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.960
So clicking "V1"
we're going to type

9
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.710
equals sum and open our brackets.

10
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.130
I'm going to click on "Q2" and

11
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.280
"Control + Shift + Down Arrow"
to select them all,

12
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.680
and then I'm going to just press

13
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.370
"Tab" so I jump back
up to the top row.

14
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.093
Small problem, we've
got the answer zero

15
00:00:52.093 --> 00:00:54.120
Now, why is that happening?

16
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.150
Well, the first clue is,

17
00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.055
if you have a look
at these numbers,

18
00:00:58.055 --> 00:01:00.850
they're all aligning to the left,

19
00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.775
and that is often a hint
that there is a problem.

20
00:01:04.775 --> 00:01:09.605
Numbers in Excel automatically
align to the right.

21
00:01:09.605 --> 00:01:11.630
What's happened here is,

22
00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.180
although it contains
valid numbers,

23
00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.650
we got to them by
using text functions.

24
00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.730
This data is being
stored as text,

25
00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.750
and this can be quite
a common problem with

26
00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.395
data that comes out
of external systems.

27
00:01:27.395 --> 00:01:29.375
Before we can perform

28
00:01:29.375 --> 00:01:32.600
any arithmetic operations
on these values,

29
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.139
we need to actually convert
them to proper numbers,

30
00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:38.420
and the function
that will help us do

31
00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.485
this is the VALUE function.

32
00:01:41.485 --> 00:01:44.315
Now let's have a look
at how it works.

33
00:01:44.315 --> 00:01:47.810
I'm going to just click
into "V2" and type

34
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:53.100
"=va" and tab
to select value,

35
00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.055
and when I click on
the "Amount" and press

36
00:01:59.055 --> 00:02:03.610
"Enter" you'll see it's
actually aligning to the right.

37
00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.205
It's behaving like a number.

38
00:02:06.205 --> 00:02:10.060
I'm going to undo that
and we're now going to

39
00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.405
apply the VALUE function to
our existing calculation.

40
00:02:14.405 --> 00:02:17.800
I'm going to double-click
into "Q2," and

41
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.505
there's already a fairly
large calculation there.

42
00:02:21.505 --> 00:02:23.950
We want to take the result of

43
00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.480
that whole calculation
and apply a value.

44
00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.000
So we're going to click
between the equals and

45
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.740
the substitute, type "va",

46
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.070
press Tab, don't forget

47
00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.515
to close your
brackets at the end,

48
00:02:39.515 --> 00:02:42.095
press Enter and hey presto,

49
00:02:42.095 --> 00:02:44.560
you've got a number, and

50
00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.285
when I double-click
to copy that down,

51
00:02:47.285 --> 00:02:50.240
all of our data has converted.

52
00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.980
So that's the problem

53
00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.740
sorted with getting
texts to numbers.

54
00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.550
Now I should just point out
that if you try to apply

55
00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.950
a VALUE function to a cell that

56
00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.619
contained a
non-numeric character,

57
00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:06.350
you would actually
get a Value Error.

58
00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.320
So you will need to
make sure you've only

59
00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.605
got numeric characters
inside that cell.

60
00:03:12.605 --> 00:03:14.915
What we're going to look at next

61
00:03:14.915 --> 00:03:17.255
is solving the opposite problem.

62
00:03:17.255 --> 00:03:19.820
That's where you have a number or

63
00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.925
a date and you want to
convert it to text,

64
00:03:22.925 --> 00:03:24.920
and that's the problem Zara has

65
00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.595
encountered in the other report.

66
00:03:27.595 --> 00:03:30.675
So let's just click
into the next tab,

67
00:03:30.675 --> 00:03:33.590
and just like she did
in the previous sheet,

68
00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.575
she needs to get
the invoice month.

69
00:03:36.575 --> 00:03:39.095
If you have a look
at the data here,

70
00:03:39.095 --> 00:03:42.185
it's been stored
as a proper date,

71
00:03:42.185 --> 00:03:46.100
and so we can't use
our LEFT, RIGHT

72
00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.230
or MID functions that we learned

73
00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.915
about last week to extract it.

74
00:03:50.915 --> 00:03:52.760
The function we are going to need

75
00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.945
here is the TEXT function.

76
00:03:55.945 --> 00:03:58.610
The TEXT function is almost like

77
00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.175
the opposite of the
VALUE function.

78
00:04:01.175 --> 00:04:03.890
It takes a valid date or

79
00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.430
a valid number and
converts it to text.

80
00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.530
Let's have a look
at how it works.

81
00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:17.415
So clicking in "K5," I'm
going to type "=te"

82
00:04:17.415 --> 00:04:19.890
and Tab to select text.

83
00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:24.420
The first thing it wants is
the value we want to convert.

84
00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.715
So I'm going to click on my

85
00:04:26.715 --> 00:04:29.940
Invoice Date and type a comma.

86
00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.255
The next thing it needs to know

87
00:04:32.255 --> 00:04:35.095
is what do we actually
want to get back,

88
00:04:35.095 --> 00:04:36.565
do we want month?

89
00:04:36.565 --> 00:04:38.575
Do we want year?

90
00:04:38.575 --> 00:04:42.860
Well, we tell Excel this
by giving it a code.

91
00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.610
I'm going to start by
opening my double quotes,

92
00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.220
because it's going
to be a text code,

93
00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.700
and we use D to represent days,

94
00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:57.005
M for months, and Y for years.

95
00:04:57.005 --> 00:04:59.780
Now a single D will return

96
00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.630
me a day without a leading zero

97
00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.230
So this case will give me a two,

98
00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:10.045
but for this case it
will give me a 16.

99
00:05:10.045 --> 00:05:12.330
If I put two Ds,

100
00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:19.155
that would give me a
02 or over here 16,

101
00:05:19.155 --> 00:05:21.470
three Ds will actually give me

102
00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:24.515
the day of the week with just
the first three characters,

103
00:05:24.515 --> 00:05:28.160
and four Ds will give me
the whole day of the week.

104
00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.750
So let's just have a
look at how that works.

105
00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.230
I'm going to press Enter

106
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:37.110
and you can see
that was a Monday.

107
00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.935
Well, that's not
actually what we want.

108
00:05:39.935 --> 00:05:42.830
We want the month and for
the month we're going to

109
00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.810
use M. So I'm going
to type three Ms,

110
00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:48.620
which will give me the month,

111
00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:50.780
abbreviated to three characters,

112
00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:54.260
and when I press
Enter, there we go,

113
00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.580
and we'll copy that down.

114
00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:01.599
So the two functions we've
seen are the VALUE function,

115
00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:04.130
which would take numeric
characters stored as

116
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.814
text and convert them to numbers,

117
00:06:06.814 --> 00:06:08.600
and the TEXT function,

118
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.210
which will take
numbers or dates and

119
00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:14.995
convert them to a text
format of your choosing.

120
00:06:14.995 --> 00:06:17.600
So two very useful functions for

121
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:21.630
converting your data
into the form you need.
