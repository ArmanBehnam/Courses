00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.718
[SOUND] Hi, Nicky.

2
00:00:04.718 --> 00:00:06.880
>> Hi.

3
00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.020
>> So last week, we manipulated and
corrected all our text data.

4
00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:12.390
Is it ready for analysis now?

5
00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.120
>> Not quite, we've only dealt with text.

6
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.390
We still have some problems with
some of the numbers and the dates.

7
00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.380
So we're going to need to
look at fixing those two.

8
00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.226
>> And because text functions are only
designed for working with text data, I'm

9
00:00:26.226 --> 00:00:29.833
guessing there will be a whole collection
of new functions for doing this.

10
00:00:29.833 --> 00:00:31.128
>> You are so right.

11
00:00:31.128 --> 00:00:34.954
First up, we're going to look at
functions for converting data types, so

12
00:00:34.954 --> 00:00:37.150
we're going to convert text to numbers.

13
00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.164
We're going to convert dates to text.

14
00:00:39.164 --> 00:00:43.210
And then we're going to look at how we
can convert numbers and text to dates.

15
00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.990
And this will again help solve the problem
of data not being in the correct format.

16
00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:49.600
>> I've had that same problem.

17
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.510
I downloaded my bank statement, but
when I tried to add up all the credits and

18
00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.260
the debits, I got zero.

19
00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.060
And it turned out that even
though they looked like numbers,

20
00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:59.395
they were actually text.

21
00:00:59.395 --> 00:01:02.330
>> Yeah, and that's a great example, and

22
00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.530
exactly the kind of issue
we're going to look at fixing.

23
00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.080
>> I've also had some strange things
happen with numbers and dates.

24
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.924
Sometimes I type in a date, and
I get a random currency value.

25
00:01:12.924 --> 00:01:16.738
And other times, I type in a number,
and it converts it to a date.

26
00:01:16.738 --> 00:01:21.480
>> That's quite alarming,
but it's not Excel gone mad.

27
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.700
The reason is that dates in Excel
are really just numbers formatted

28
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.040
to look like dates.

29
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.800
>> What do you mean when you
say the data is formatted?

30
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.630
>> Formatting means change
the way something looks, but

31
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.850
not changing its actual value.

32
00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.810
So for example,
0.5 is the same as 50 cents, or it's 50%.

33
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.640
We've just formatted it to look different,
but it's actually the same amount.

34
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.700
Dates work very much the same way.

35
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.954
The number 1 is the same
as 1st of January, 1900.

36
00:01:50.954 --> 00:01:53.091
2 is the 2nd of January, 1900.

37
00:01:53.091 --> 00:01:56.483
And so today's date would be
equivalent to however many days it

38
00:01:56.483 --> 00:01:59.045
has been since the 1st of January, 1900.

39
00:01:59.045 --> 00:02:04.321
>> So that means we can't have a date in
Excel before the 1st of January, 1900.

40
00:02:04.321 --> 00:02:05.775
>> Yeah, exactly.

41
00:02:05.775 --> 00:02:09.735
But more importantly,
it means we can do arithmetic with dates,

42
00:02:09.735 --> 00:02:11.405
like we would with numbers.

43
00:02:11.405 --> 00:02:14.969
If we take the 1st of Jan, and
we add 1, we get the 2nd of Jan.

44
00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:16.950
Now, that's really useful.

45
00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.117
And that's the other thing we're
going to be looking at this week,

46
00:02:20.117 --> 00:02:22.540
performing calculations with our dates.

47
00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.480
>> That sounds nice and straightforward.

48
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.550
But what about if you want to take into
account weekends, and holidays, or

49
00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.370
try and
work out the last day of the month?

50
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.660
Which isn't the same for every month,
and isn't even the same every year for

51
00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:36.220
February?

52
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.870
>> Yeah, and that's where Excel has some
really great functions, specifically for

53
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.020
solving those trickier date problems.

54
00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.393
So we're going to be looking at WORKDAY,
WORKDAY international, EDATE, and

55
00:02:48.393 --> 00:02:53.430
the EOMONTH function, which will solve
that last problem you mentioned.

56
00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:54.320
>> Thanks, Nicky.

57
00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.292
So another action-packed week.

58
00:02:56.292 --> 00:03:00.197
Here are the topics we'll be covering,
converting data types,

59
00:03:00.197 --> 00:03:03.112
understanding dates and
basic date functions.

60
00:03:03.112 --> 00:03:04.745
Generating valid dates,

61
00:03:04.745 --> 00:03:09.510
calculating days between two date,s
calculating dates from a given date.

62
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.160
Each one has a great training video.

63
00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.160
Don't forget to download
the new workbook for

64
00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.510
this week, as it's a little
bit different to last week.

65
00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.230
And check out this week's toolbox, which
has another quick reference guide, and

66
00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.410
some really useful bonus material,

67
00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.640
which will help you with this
week's practice challenge.

68
00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:29.120
Everyone say wow.
