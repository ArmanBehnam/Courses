00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.140
In this video, we're
going to look at

2
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.030
some Excel functions
that will help

3
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.720
us clean up text data and
even convert the case.

4
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.670
The column we're going to be
focusing on is the column E,

5
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.280
which has the invoice
or credit information.

6
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.710
You'll notice there are
some strange characters in

7
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.649
there that we've got what
looks like extra spaces,

8
00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:28.605
and the cases are a bit of a mix.

9
00:00:28.605 --> 00:00:31.575
Zara needs to tidy this all up.

10
00:00:31.575 --> 00:00:33.440
The first thing
she wants to do is

11
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.860
get rid of those
weird characters.

12
00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.935
The function we're going to
use is the CLEAN function.

13
00:00:39.935 --> 00:00:42.950
Excel's CLEAN function
is quite specific.

14
00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.035
It is designed to remove

15
00:00:45.035 --> 00:00:51.150
the first 32 non-printing
characters in the ASCII table.

16
00:00:54.293 --> 00:00:56.270
These characters
typically come through

17
00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.220
as spaces and we get them in

18
00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.620
our data when we import or

19
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.505
download data from
an external system.

20
00:01:03.505 --> 00:01:05.295
They can cause problems,

21
00:01:05.295 --> 00:01:07.595
so it is really important
that we clean them up.

22
00:01:07.595 --> 00:01:10.175
Good news is, it's
very easy to do.

23
00:01:10.175 --> 00:01:12.590
So back in our supply
invoice statement,

24
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.826
we're going to clean
up the data in column E

25
00:01:16.626 --> 00:01:19.235
We're going to start
by using the Type column.

26
00:01:19.235 --> 00:01:20.885
So where we've got P2,

27
00:01:20.885 --> 00:01:25.750
can you type equals and
"cl" for clean, and tab.

28
00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.100
The CLEAN only
needs one argument,

29
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.080
and that's the texts
that we want clean up.

30
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.325
So I'm going to click on
E2 and press "Enter".

31
00:01:34.325 --> 00:01:37.090
When I double-clicks
to copy down,

32
00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.230
all those strange non-printing

33
00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.240
characters have been removed.

34
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.100
You will notice
though that there are

35
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.385
still what looks
like extra spaces.

36
00:01:46.385 --> 00:01:48.960
So the space is ASCII character

37
00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.215
32 that is not removed
by the CLEAN function.

38
00:01:52.215 --> 00:01:54.215
If we want to get rid of a space,

39
00:01:54.215 --> 00:01:57.655
we need to use Excel's
TRIM function.

40
00:01:57.655 --> 00:02:00.185
Now, TRIM doesn't
remove all spaces,

41
00:02:00.185 --> 00:02:02.555
it only removes extra spaces.

42
00:02:02.555 --> 00:02:04.130
What we mean by that is,

43
00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.095
leading spaces, they
come before the text,

44
00:02:07.095 --> 00:02:09.860
trailing spaces which come
at the end of the text,

45
00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.460
and where you have more than
one space between the text.

46
00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:14.960
So first name space,

47
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.330
surname, the space
will not be removed.

48
00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:18.860
But if there were two spaces,

49
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.485
the second one would.

50
00:02:20.485 --> 00:02:23.715
Let's see how we apply
the TRIM function.

51
00:02:23.715 --> 00:02:27.750
So what we're going to do now
is TRIM our cleaned data.

52
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.875
So double-click into P2,

53
00:02:29.875 --> 00:02:32.260
come before the equals and the C,

54
00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.100
and type t, r,

55
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.800
i, and tab to select TRIM.

56
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.820
Now we have two functions,

57
00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:40.990
two sets of brackets.

58
00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.780
We must put our last bracket in.

59
00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.210
When we click "Enter" and again,

60
00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:51.680
copy down, all those extra
spaces have been removed.

61
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.210
People often type in
extra spaces as well.

62
00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:55.990
So that's a really
useful function to

63
00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.285
make sure that they
aren't extra spaces.

64
00:02:58.285 --> 00:03:00.625
One last thing we need to do now

65
00:03:00.625 --> 00:03:03.745
is get all the case
looking consistent.

66
00:03:03.745 --> 00:03:06.410
We don't want this mixture
of upper and lower.

67
00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.160
There are three functions
that will allow

68
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.830
us to change the case in Excel.

69
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.274
They are UPPER, which converts
everything to uppercase,

70
00:03:15.274 --> 00:03:18.150
LOWER, which converts
everything to lowercase,

71
00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.889
and PROPER, which converts

72
00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:22.465
the first letter of each word to

73
00:03:22.465 --> 00:03:24.985
uppercase and everything
else to lowercase.

74
00:03:24.985 --> 00:03:27.850
So that's ideal for
names and addresses.

75
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.065
But this data, we'd like
it all to be uppercase.

76
00:03:32.065 --> 00:03:36.220
So we're going to come in
to P2 and double-click.

77
00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.500
We want to take this whole thing,

78
00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.060
the result from our
TRIM and make it upper.

79
00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.960
So we're going to wrap
it in an UPPER function.

80
00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.790
So just between the
equals and the T,

81
00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.180
we're going to type "up" and tab.

82
00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.710
Don't forget to close
your last bracket

83
00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:56.265
again, and press "Enter".

84
00:03:56.265 --> 00:03:58.495
The first one was
already uppercase,

85
00:03:58.495 --> 00:04:00.565
but when I double-clicked
to copy down,

86
00:04:00.565 --> 00:04:02.305
all my data is now

87
00:04:02.305 --> 00:04:05.090
uppercase and that's
looking fantastic.

88
00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.715
So quite a few functions
we've looked at here.

89
00:04:07.715 --> 00:04:09.530
We've looked at CLEAN,

90
00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.090
we're getting rid of the first

91
00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.670
32 non-printing characters, TRIM,

92
00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.835
which gets rid of extra spaces,

93
00:04:15.835 --> 00:04:18.830
and then our three functions
for changing case,

94
00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:20.785
which were UPPER,
LOWER, and PROPER.

95
00:04:20.785 --> 00:04:23.180
In the next video, we're
going to have a look

96
00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.340
at some Excel functions
that will help us

97
00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.440
get rid of characters
that TRIM and

98
00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.770
CLEAN can't help us
with. So keep watching.
