[MUSIC]

2
00:00:05.313 --> 00:00:10.418
In this video, we're going to look
at some Excel functions that will

3
00:00:10.418 --> 00:00:15.624
allow us to split text data,
namely the LEFT, RIGHT and MID functions.

4
00:00:15.624 --> 00:00:21.536
So Zara's next task is to find out
which month each invoice was raised in.

5
00:00:21.536 --> 00:00:25.706
What she basically needs to
do is extract the first three

6
00:00:25.706 --> 00:00:28.552
characters from the invoice column.

7
00:00:28.552 --> 00:00:33.459
And to do this she's going to
use Excel's LEFT function.

8
00:00:33.459 --> 00:00:38.799
So we're going to click into M2 and

9
00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:41.654
type "=le" and Tab.

10
00:00:41.654 --> 00:00:46.462
The first thing the LEFT function needs
to know is the original text that you

11
00:00:46.462 --> 00:00:47.618
want to split up.

12
00:00:47.618 --> 00:00:51.026
That's our invoiced value in D2.

13
00:00:51.026 --> 00:00:54.015
Then we type a comma.

14
00:00:54.015 --> 00:00:58.828
The next thing the LEFT wants to know
is how many characters do we want to

15
00:00:58.828 --> 00:01:01.696
extract from the left of that text in D2.

16
00:01:01.696 --> 00:01:04.202
And the answer is 3.

17
00:01:04.202 --> 00:01:09.375
Press Tab to jump to the next cell and

18
00:01:09.375 --> 00:01:12.486
there's our March.

19
00:01:12.486 --> 00:01:18.025
The next things Zara wanted to do is get
the purchase order number on its own.

20
00:01:18.025 --> 00:01:22.792
At the moment, the purchase order number
is joined to the location the customer

21
00:01:22.792 --> 00:01:24.302
purchase order column.

22
00:01:24.302 --> 00:01:29.386
So this time we want to extract
six characters from the right.

23
00:01:29.386 --> 00:01:32.988
And yes,
we're going to use the RIGHT function.

24
00:01:32.988 --> 00:01:38.756
So in N2, type =ri and
Tab to select RIGHT.

25
00:01:38.756 --> 00:01:42.287
I'll text this time is G2.

26
00:01:42.287 --> 00:01:44.195
Type a comma.

27
00:01:44.195 --> 00:01:47.485
And we need six characters.

28
00:01:47.485 --> 00:01:51.548
And again, let's press Tab to jump in O2.

29
00:01:51.548 --> 00:01:55.094
And there's our purchase order number.

30
00:01:55.094 --> 00:01:59.827
The last example we're going to look
at is we want to get the location

31
00:01:59.827 --> 00:02:04.074
which is also in the purchase
order number to keep it simple.

32
00:02:04.074 --> 00:02:08.486
We're just going to return an S for
Sydney and an M for Melbourne.

33
00:02:08.486 --> 00:02:12.240
But you'll notice the location is not
on the left and it's not on the right.

34
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.340
It's actually in the middle.

35
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.145
So for this one we're going to
need to use Excel's MID function.

36
00:02:19.145 --> 00:02:24.174
In O2, start by typing "=mi" and

37
00:02:24.174 --> 00:02:27.164
Tab to select MID.

38
00:02:27.164 --> 00:02:30.981
The MID function has three arguments.

39
00:02:30.981 --> 00:02:33.036
It starts with the text.

40
00:02:33.036 --> 00:02:36.778
So we're going to click on G2 and
type comma.

41
00:02:36.778 --> 00:02:40.744
But now because it's not starting
at the left or the right,

42
00:02:40.744 --> 00:02:43.217
we need to specify a start position.

43
00:02:43.217 --> 00:02:47.062
And the start position is
actually position number four,

44
00:02:47.062 --> 00:02:50.208
which is where the first
letter we want begins.

45
00:02:50.208 --> 00:02:54.185
So we're going to type a 4 and then
a comma and now it's like the LEFT and

46
00:02:54.185 --> 00:02:54.860
the RIGHT.

47
00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:00.622
We specify how many characters we
want to get from that position.

48
00:03:00.622 --> 00:03:03.318
And the answer is 1.

49
00:03:03.318 --> 00:03:07.728
If we press Enter,
there's our S for Sydney.

50
00:03:07.728 --> 00:03:09.572
And we can now copy all three down.

51
00:03:09.572 --> 00:03:12.827
So I'm going to select M2 to O2.

52
00:03:12.827 --> 00:03:18.524
Come to my fill handle and
double click to copy down.

53
00:03:18.524 --> 00:03:22.485
So to recap,
the three functions we've looked at for

54
00:03:22.485 --> 00:03:26.102
splitting text Data are LEFT,
RIGHT, and MID.

55
00:03:26.102 --> 00:03:28.928
These examples were all
fairly straightforward.

56
00:03:28.928 --> 00:03:33.424
But in the next video, we're going to look
at how we can solve slightly more complex

57
00:03:33.424 --> 00:03:37.744
problems where the data we want to extract
isn't necessarily the same length.
