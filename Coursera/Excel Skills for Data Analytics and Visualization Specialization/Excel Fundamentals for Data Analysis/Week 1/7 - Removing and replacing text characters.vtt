2
00:00:05.468 --> 00:00:09.300
In this video, we're going to
look at how we can replace or

3
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.932
remove unwanted characters,
using Excel's SUBSTITUTE function.

4
00:00:13.932 --> 00:00:19.440
In the last video, we saw how we could
use CLEAN and TRIM to get rid of certain

5
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.879
non-printing characters and
extra spaces, but this is quite limited.

6
00:00:24.879 --> 00:00:27.490
If you have a look at
our Paid Amount column,

7
00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.171
we've ended up with an S
instead of a dollar,

8
00:00:30.171 --> 00:00:35.170
and we actually need to either get rid
of that or replace it with a dollar.

9
00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.851
TRIM and CLEAN can't help us with this,
but the SUBSTITUTE function can.

10
00:00:40.851 --> 00:00:45.237
What SUBSTITUTE does is,
given a string, it will look for

11
00:00:45.237 --> 00:00:50.981
a string within that string, and
replace it with anything else you choose.

12
00:00:50.981 --> 00:00:56.621
So what we're going to do now,
is get rid of that S using SUBSTITUTE.

13
00:00:56.621 --> 00:01:01.013
We're going to click into Q2,
which is going to be our new amount field.

14
00:01:01.013 --> 00:01:06.394
And we're going to type "=SUB" and
TAB, for SUBSTITUTE.

15
00:01:06.394 --> 00:01:11.886
The first argument is the main text string
where you wish to make the substitution,

16
00:01:11.886 --> 00:01:14.245
and that's going to be our amount.

17
00:01:14.245 --> 00:01:16.706
Then we type a comma.

18
00:01:16.706 --> 00:01:22.330
The old text is the text we want to
replace, so that's going to be our S.

19
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.691
And we want to replace that with
absolutely nothing, and this is curious.

20
00:01:27.691 --> 00:01:32.211
We specify this by opening our quotes and
immediately closing them.

21
00:01:32.211 --> 00:01:36.690
When we then close our brackets and
press Enter, that S has been replaced.

22
00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.752
Perfect, or not quite, we still have this,

23
00:01:41.752 --> 00:01:45.921
what looks like a space,
just before the number.

24
00:01:45.921 --> 00:01:50.497
Well, if it was a space,
we would be able to do this,

25
00:01:50.497 --> 00:01:53.522
substitute S space with nothing.

26
00:01:53.522 --> 00:01:59.131
But when I press Enter, our S is back, and
that tells me that this can't be a space.

27
00:01:59.131 --> 00:02:02.033
I would probably also try
a CLEAN function on this, but

28
00:02:02.033 --> 00:02:04.693
I happen to know that's
not going to work either.

29
00:02:04.693 --> 00:02:09.852
So I'm just going to remove that space,
so at least we've got rid of our S.

30
00:02:09.852 --> 00:02:14.414
So now, we need to work out how
we get rid of this character,

31
00:02:14.414 --> 00:02:16.987
where we're not sure what it is.

32
00:02:19.202 --> 00:02:22.112
Well again,
we're going to do a SUBSTITUTE.

33
00:02:22.112 --> 00:02:24.559
And what we're going to do is,

34
00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:29.941
tell Excel to substitute whatever
that happens to be with nothing.

35
00:02:29.941 --> 00:02:33.119
But because we're doing
another substitution,

36
00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:36.453
we're going to need a second
SUBSTITUTE function.

37
00:02:36.453 --> 00:02:41.258
So coming back to Q2,
we're going to double click, and

38
00:02:41.258 --> 00:02:45.062
just between our equals and
our SUBSTITUTE,

39
00:02:45.062 --> 00:02:49.982
we're going to type SU and tab,
to add another SUBSTITUTE.

40
00:02:49.982 --> 00:02:54.143
The string that we're going to make
the substitution in this time is our newly

41
00:02:54.143 --> 00:02:55.371
substituted string.

42
00:02:55.371 --> 00:02:58.940
So we're just going to type
a comma after our red bracket.

43
00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.219
But now, we have to tell it
what the old text is, and

44
00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:05.101
we're not actually sure what it is.

45
00:03:05.101 --> 00:03:07.901
We know it's not a space, but

46
00:03:07.901 --> 00:03:12.832
what we do know is it's
the second character in F2.

47
00:03:12.832 --> 00:03:18.402
And to get that second character in F2,
we're going to use our MID function again.

48
00:03:18.402 --> 00:03:21.539
So let's type MID and tab.

49
00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:27.993
The text were trying to extract
something from, is our paid amount.

50
00:03:27.993 --> 00:03:34.505
And we're going to start at the second
position, and get one character,

51
00:03:34.505 --> 00:03:39.561
close our brackets for our MID,
and type another comma.

52
00:03:39.561 --> 00:03:45.852
Once we find that character, we're going
to replace it with absolutely nothing.

53
00:03:45.852 --> 00:03:49.873
Close your bracket for
your second SUBSTITUTE.

54
00:03:49.873 --> 00:03:55.359
When we press enter,
we have now removed both characters

55
00:03:55.359 --> 00:04:00.513
from the start, and
we can double click to copy down.

56
00:04:00.513 --> 00:04:06.931
So the SUBSTITUTE function will allow
you to replace a part of your text.

57
00:04:06.931 --> 00:04:09.411
If you need to make more
than one replacement,

58
00:04:09.411 --> 00:04:12.565
you're going to need more
than one SUBSTITUTE function.

59
00:04:12.565 --> 00:04:17.888
Two other great functions for cleaning,
we're not going to cover in this video,

60
00:04:17.888 --> 00:04:22.353
but check them out in the toolbox,
they're UNICODE and UNICHAR.

61
00:04:22.353 --> 00:04:25.325
We've covered a lot of great
text functions this week, but

62
00:04:25.325 --> 00:04:29.850
practice makes permanent, so don't forget
to try out this week's practice challenge.
