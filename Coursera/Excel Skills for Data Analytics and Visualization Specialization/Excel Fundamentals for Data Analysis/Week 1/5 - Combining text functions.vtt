00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.775
In this video, we're going to
look at how we can combine

2
00:00:08.775 --> 00:00:10.485
Excel functions to get

3
00:00:10.485 --> 00:00:11.970
even more power and

4
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.520
solve those more
complicated problems.

5
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.290
In the last example,

6
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:18.660
we used a MID function to

7
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.545
extract the first
letter of the location.

8
00:00:22.545 --> 00:00:25.875
Zara really needs the Full Name.

9
00:00:25.875 --> 00:00:28.890
The only problem
is that Sydney is

10
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.590
six letters and Melbourne
is nine letters.

11
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.650
So she can't just type a
six or a nine in here.

12
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:40.080
She needs Excel to calculate
that length for her.

13
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.660
The good news is that Excel is

14
00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.489
very good at working
with patterns.

15
00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:45.845
As long as there's a
pattern in the data,

16
00:00:45.845 --> 00:00:47.705
it can probably help.

17
00:00:47.705 --> 00:00:51.640
If you had data that was
all lowercase 'mickeymouse',

18
00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.110
although our brains
could immediately

19
00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.060
split that, there is no pattern.

20
00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.640
It's all lowercase.
Excel can't help us.

21
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.670
But with our customer
purchase order,

22
00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.490
there are a couple of
fairly obvious patterns.

23
00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:06.185
You'll notice, for example,

24
00:01:06.185 --> 00:01:08.510
that the location always
has three characters

25
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.585
before it and always
has a hyphen after it.

26
00:01:11.585 --> 00:01:14.555
So if we can just locate
the position of the hyphen,

27
00:01:14.555 --> 00:01:17.930
we can work out how
long a location is.

28
00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.345
This is exactly what
we're going to do

29
00:01:20.345 --> 00:01:23.650
using Excel's FIND function.

30
00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.525
I'm going to start by
doing the FIND on its

31
00:01:26.525 --> 00:01:29.270
own and will just borrow
the 'type' column for this.

32
00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:35.770
In P2, we're going to
type "=FIN" and TAB.

33
00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.950
What the FIND does is
find a string within

34
00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.750
another string and return

35
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.175
the position at which it starts.

36
00:01:45.175 --> 00:01:49.040
By default, it will return
the first instance it finds,

37
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.750
but we'll see that we can
specify a start position.

38
00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.950
The first thing it
wants to know is

39
00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.485
the string or the texts
you're looking for,

40
00:01:57.485 --> 00:01:59.765
and in this situation,
it's our hyphen.

41
00:01:59.765 --> 00:02:02.075
So open double-quotes, hyphen,

42
00:02:02.075 --> 00:02:05.140
close double-quotes,
and now type a comma.

43
00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.220
The second thing it
wants to know is

44
00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.900
where we're searching
for this hyphen,

45
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.895
and we're looking for
it in our customer

46
00:02:10.895 --> 00:02:13.505
PO, and type a comma.

47
00:02:13.505 --> 00:02:16.910
The last argument
has square brackets,

48
00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.530
and that means it's optional,

49
00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.720
which means in
certain circumstances

50
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.430
we don't have to supply it.

51
00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.590
If we were quite happy
for Excel to find

52
00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.660
the first hyphen, we
could leave it off,

53
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:27.950
but we don't want

54
00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.855
the first hyphen and
we want the second,

55
00:02:29.855 --> 00:02:32.360
so we need to specify
that it starts

56
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.685
from position four or somewhere
after the first hyphen.

57
00:02:36.685 --> 00:02:38.790
That's our FIND and if I press

58
00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.640
"Enter," it told me it found

59
00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.510
the second hyphen at
position 10, that's great.

60
00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.580
The problem is I don't actually

61
00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.580
want to extract 10 characters,

62
00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.045
I only want to extract six.

63
00:02:52.045 --> 00:02:54.230
I need to account for
the fact that there are

64
00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.470
three characters before
Sydney and the hyphen after,

65
00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.050
that's all being included
in that calculation.

66
00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.750
So I need to subtract four to

67
00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.725
get back to my actual location
length, which is six.

68
00:03:05.725 --> 00:03:07.905
Coming back into P2,

69
00:03:07.905 --> 00:03:11.420
I'm going to double-click
and I'm gonna type minus

70
00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.000
four outside the brackets

71
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.395
and press "Enter,"
and there's my six.

72
00:03:17.395 --> 00:03:19.435
Now that I've done that,

73
00:03:19.435 --> 00:03:21.875
I could go and retype
it into my MID,

74
00:03:21.875 --> 00:03:24.230
but I don't need to, I
can just copy paste.

75
00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.210
So I'm going to select
everything from

76
00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:28.280
FIND to the end of
the minus four,

77
00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.550
but don't include the equals
and "Control+C" to copy.

78
00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.210
Now press "Escape" so you don't

79
00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:36.090
accidentally mess
up your formula,

80
00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.940
and double-click back into O2.

81
00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.925
Where we had our one previously,

82
00:03:41.925 --> 00:03:43.810
we're going to remove that

83
00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.330
and we're going to
paste in our FIND,

84
00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.685
"Control+V" to paste.

85
00:03:49.685 --> 00:03:53.985
Now press "Enter."
There is Sydney,

86
00:03:53.985 --> 00:03:55.330
and if I double-clicked copy

87
00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.370
down, there's all my Melbournes.

88
00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.080
That was how we
could use the FIND.

89
00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.030
But the FIND does
rely on us having

90
00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:05.560
some form of delimiter

91
00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.810
and we don't always
have that luxury.

92
00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.915
What about if there were no
hyphens in this example?

93
00:04:11.915 --> 00:04:15.580
Well, actually there is
another pattern as well.

94
00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.560
The location is
always preceded by

95
00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.210
three characters and
has seven after.

96
00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.300
In other words, the total
length of the string is

97
00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.345
always going to be
10 plus my location.

98
00:04:29.345 --> 00:04:32.960
If I get the total length of
the string and subtract 10,

99
00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.625
that will tell me how
long my location name is.

100
00:04:36.625 --> 00:04:39.490
There's a function that
can help us with this.

101
00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.555
It's called the LEN function,

102
00:04:41.555 --> 00:04:43.915
which is an
abbreviation of length.

103
00:04:43.915 --> 00:04:46.045
Let's see how it works.

104
00:04:46.045 --> 00:04:48.029
Clicking back into P2,

105
00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:51.405
I'm going to type equals LEN,

106
00:04:51.405 --> 00:04:54.605
and tab to open my brackets,

107
00:04:54.605 --> 00:04:56.570
and then I'm going to click on

108
00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:59.465
my purchase order number
and press "Enter."

109
00:04:59.465 --> 00:05:03.415
As we would expect, the
total length is 16.

110
00:05:03.415 --> 00:05:05.625
Now we need to subtract

111
00:05:05.625 --> 00:05:08.620
the 10 characters that
are not our location.

112
00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.120
So I'm just going
to type minus 10,

113
00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.490
and we're back to our six.

114
00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.470
Brilliant. Let's finish that

115
00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:17.600
off by putting our
MID function in.

116
00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.175
Just after the equals,

117
00:05:19.175 --> 00:05:21.820
I'm going to type "MID" and tab,

118
00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:25.350
the text I'm trying
to chop up is G2.

119
00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:28.000
I need to start at position 4,

120
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.410
and a comma, and that's

121
00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:33.020
how many characters I
need to extract that.

122
00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.470
But now we have more than
one set of brackets,

123
00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:38.240
we must remember to close
our brackets for our MID.

124
00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.205
Tip to the wise. Make sure
you last bracket is black.

125
00:05:42.205 --> 00:05:45.510
When I press "Enter,"
there is Sydney,

126
00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:47.625
and if I copy down,

127
00:05:47.625 --> 00:05:49.950
there are my locations.

128
00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:52.655
So two great solutions
to this problem,

129
00:05:52.655 --> 00:05:55.645
one using FIND, one using LEN.

130
00:05:55.645 --> 00:05:57.740
The important takeaway though

131
00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.870
is to see how we can
actually combine

132
00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:01.400
Excel functions to get

133
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.110
even more power and solve

134
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:05.880
those more complicated problems.
