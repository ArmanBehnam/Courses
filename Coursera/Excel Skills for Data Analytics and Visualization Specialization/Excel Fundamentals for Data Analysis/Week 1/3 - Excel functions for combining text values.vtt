2
00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:08.651
In this video we're going to look
at a range of Excel functions for

3
00:00:08.651 --> 00:00:12.990
taking data from two or more sources and
combining them into a single cell.

4
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.510
In our scenario Zara has received
a statement from the supplier

5
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.120
detailing all the invoices that
have been paid this month.

6
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.930
She needs to reconcile
this with her system data,

7
00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.150
which she has downloaded
into an Excel file.

8
00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.880
The problem is a lot of
the data doesn't match.

9
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.270
So for example with her system,

10
00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.620
the Payment Reference is made up of
the Invoice Number and the Payment Number.

11
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.023
On the supplier statement, however,
this data is in two separate columns.

12
00:00:46.023 --> 00:00:48.641
Before she can actually
compare these values,

13
00:00:48.641 --> 00:00:52.640
she's going to need to join the Document
Number and the Payment Number.

14
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.528
She's created a column in
which to put the new value,

15
00:00:56.528 --> 00:01:02.166
and we're going to help her do it
using Excel's CONCATENATE function.

16
00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:08.129
Start by clicking into K2 and type "=conc".

17
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.166
If you have 2016 or later,

18
00:01:11.166 --> 00:01:16.090
you will notice there's a brand new CONCAT
function which we'll look at shortly.

19
00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.660
But the CONCATENATE is still widely used,
and if you don't have 2016 or

20
00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.480
later you're still going
to have to use this.

21
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.850
You'll notice a strange little chevron
here, it is actually being made redundant

22
00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.730
so it's still being kept for
backward compatibility.

23
00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:36.345
But if your organization's on the newer
version, you probably want to start moving

24
00:01:36.345 --> 00:01:39.859
to the CONCAT function, but
let's see the CONCATENATE first.

25
00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:44.990
So to select it you could double click,
but I'm going to down arrow and tab.

26
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.822
Now whenever you use an Excel function
it will give you a help prompt

27
00:01:51.822 --> 00:01:56.428
explaining what things or
arguments need to go in the brackets.

28
00:01:56.428 --> 00:01:58.622
In the case of the CONCATENATE function,

29
00:01:58.622 --> 00:02:02.430
we just comma separate all
the text values we want to join.

30
00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.590
So we're going to start by
clicking on the document number.

31
00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:08.930
The next thing we need is an underscore.

32
00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.541
We're going to put a comma, but

33
00:02:11.541 --> 00:02:15.619
if you just type underscore
you will get an error.

34
00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:18.964
With Excel functions,
wherever you want to reference something

35
00:02:18.964 --> 00:02:22.818
that's not a cell reference or a number
you must put it in double quotes.

36
00:02:22.818 --> 00:02:27.150
So we're going to open our double quotes,
type our underscore, and

37
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.580
close our double quotes.

38
00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.030
We're then going to type another comma and
select our payment number.

39
00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.400
You can use up to 255 arguments
in a CONCATENATE function,

40
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.310
but we only need 3 so we're going to press
Enter, and there's our payment number.

41
00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.520
Now to copy that down we're going to click
back onto it, and the best way is to use

42
00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.240
the fill handle, which is the small green
square in the bottom right hand corner.

43
00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:57.590
You can drag it,

44
00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.210
the only problem is with a big data
set that's going to take a while.

45
00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:06.470
So an even quicker option is to
come to your fill handle and

46
00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.230
double click, that will copy it down
to where the data on the left stops.

47
00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.620
It only works vertically,
but it is really quick.

48
00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.440
That was our CONCATENATE function, but
there's another alternative which is also

49
00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.410
available in all versions of Excel,
and that's the Concatenate Operator.

50
00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.590
It's a little easier and
a little more versatile.

51
00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:34.088
So let's see how we could join our three
bank numbers together using the operator.

52
00:03:34.088 --> 00:03:39.100
Now an operator's a bit like
a plus rather than a function.

53
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.566
So we type our equals and
then we just click on our first value and

54
00:03:43.566 --> 00:03:46.634
type ampersand or and.

55
00:03:46.634 --> 00:03:54.220
So we want our ABN and our account and
or check digit - really easy -

56
00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.610
and when we press Enter,
there's all the numbers joined together.

57
00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.600
The only problem with both the Concatenate
Operator and the CONCATENATE function

58
00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.270
is these three values are all
sitting next to each other and yet

59
00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:08.740
we have to select each one.

60
00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:12.700
Whereas most functions will allow
us to just highlight the range.

61
00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.880
Well that's what the new
CONCAT function gives us.

62
00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.596
If you have the newer
version do this with me,

63
00:04:19.596 --> 00:04:24.670
we're going to type "=con" and
select CONCAT.

64
00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.350
We're now going to highlight
our three numbers, so

65
00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.900
starting from H2 drag to J2 and
press Enter.

66
00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.700
This also gets us around the limitation

67
00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:42.850
of 255 as long as the numbers are all next to
each other, so a few advantages there.

68
00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.720
One last option we're going to
look at is TEXTJOIN.

69
00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.960
This is a new function as well, but

70
00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.410
it has two great features that
the others don't offer us.

71
00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:55.550
So we're going to use
our bank numbers again.

72
00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:03.310
I'm clicking into L2 and I'm typing "=te"
down arrow and tab to select text join.

73
00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:10.710
The first argument it's offering is
a delimiter, this is a separator.

74
00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:12.400
So if I had a whole bunch of names and

75
00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.410
I wanted spaces between them,
I could use space as my delimiter.

76
00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:21.390
In this case, I would like a hyphen
between each set of numbers.

77
00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:25.479
So I'm going to open my double quotes,
type my hyphen,

78
00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:28.355
close my double quotes, then a comma.

79
00:05:28.355 --> 00:05:33.055
And now it gives me another argument which
is the option to ignore empty cells, so

80
00:05:33.055 --> 00:05:38.540
I wouldn't get two hyphens next to each
other if I was missing one of the numbers.

81
00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:40.919
In this case it doesn't matter, but

82
00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:45.157
I'm going to say true to ignore
empty cells and then type a comma.

83
00:05:45.157 --> 00:05:47.591
And now it's much like the concat,

84
00:05:47.591 --> 00:05:52.880
I can either individually select my items
or I can highlight the whole range.

85
00:05:54.060 --> 00:06:00.150
And when I press Enter, here's my
bank details separated by hyphens,

86
00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.110
so really, really efficient function.

87
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.995
Let's copy this one down.

88
00:06:03.995 --> 00:06:08.860
So back onto L2 and
double click on fill handle.

89
00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:12.025
So four options we looked at there,
the CONCATENATE function,

90
00:06:12.025 --> 00:06:17.810
the Concatenate Operator,
the CONCAT function, and TEXTJOIN

91
00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:24.710
For your optional homework try and create
these bank details with the separated

92
00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:27.580
hyphens but
using the Concatenate Operator.

93
00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:33.090
The solution file will have that solution
so you can check that you've got it right.
