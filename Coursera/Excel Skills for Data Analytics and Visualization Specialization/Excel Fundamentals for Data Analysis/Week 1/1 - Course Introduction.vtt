00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:07.080
As data becomes the
modern currency,

2
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.420
so the ability to
quickly and accurately

3
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.465
analyze that data has become
of paramount importance.

4
00:00:12.465 --> 00:00:15.180
One of the most flexible and
increasingly powerful tools

5
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.250
at our disposal is Excel.

6
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.660
Since the late '90s,

7
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.405
Microsoft has been adding
Analytics functionality,

8
00:00:21.405 --> 00:00:22.560
and Excel now offer

9
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.590
some fairly potent tools
for doing data analysis.

10
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.690
These include more
effective tools for

11
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.345
cleaning and
transforming text data,

12
00:00:30.345 --> 00:00:32.040
functions for performing

13
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.100
those tricky date
calculations, and tables,

14
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.340
which impose greater
data integrity and

15
00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.250
help automate the effect
of changes to the data.

16
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.295
In this course, we will
delve into these new tools,

17
00:00:43.295 --> 00:00:46.820
as well as covering the
longstanding data preparation,

18
00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.405
aggregation, logical
and lookup functions.

19
00:00:50.405 --> 00:00:53.015
Over five weeks, we're
going to walk you through

20
00:00:53.015 --> 00:00:55.460
a practical case study
seen through the eyes

21
00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.475
of Zara from the Accounts
Department of our firm.

22
00:00:58.475 --> 00:01:01.925
She's responsible for the
monthly reconciliation,

23
00:01:01.925 --> 00:01:04.670
but the data she receives
from their supplier is

24
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.495
problematic and not compatible
with her own system data.

25
00:01:08.495 --> 00:01:10.370
We will help Zara develop

26
00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.830
a solution that not
only addresses all

27
00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.600
of the issues with the data and

28
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.940
largely automates
the reconciliation,

29
00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.040
but also offers a solution that

30
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.530
is fully reusable in the future.

31
00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.050
These are the topics
we will cover.

32
00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.030
In week 1, we will focus on

33
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.860
text functions for cleaning
and manipulating text data.

34
00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.090
Week 2, we're going to look at

35
00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.465
date functions for working
more effectively with dates.

36
00:01:35.465 --> 00:01:38.649
Week 3, we're going to
explore named ranges,

37
00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:39.840
a way of simplifying

38
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.265
calculations and helping
automate processes.

39
00:01:43.265 --> 00:01:45.680
Week 4, the focus is tables,

40
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.940
for more effective and
automated data management.

41
00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.040
Week 5, we'll look at Logical
and Lookup functions for

42
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.330
categorizing, linking,
and decision-making.

43
00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.750
Regardless of what
sector you're in,

44
00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.080
this course will give
you a solid grounding in

45
00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.900
the fundamental Excel
analysis tools to

46
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.390
equip and empower
you to get on top of

47
00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.735
your data and accelerate
your data analytics.

48
00:02:08.735 --> 00:02:11.300
