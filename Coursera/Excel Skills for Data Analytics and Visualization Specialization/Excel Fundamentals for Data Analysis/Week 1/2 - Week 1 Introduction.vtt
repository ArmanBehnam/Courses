1
00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:05.745
Welcome to our first week.

2
00:00:05.745 --> 00:00:09.345
My name is Prashan and
with me today is Nicky.

3
00:00:09.345 --> 00:00:12.720
So Nicky, in our
business example,

4
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.145
which is our case study,

5
00:00:14.145 --> 00:00:15.480
we need to help Zara from

6
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.285
accounts address the
issues in her data,

7
00:00:18.285 --> 00:00:19.950
usually the first steps in

8
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:22.560
data analysis as you
prepare the data.

9
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.000
So I assume that is

10
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.070
what we are going to be
starting with this week.

11
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.110
Yes, Prashan. But we

12
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.120
actually have two
objectives this week.

13
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.280
The first thing we want
to do is actually develop

14
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.220
techniques for working
confidently with Excel functions.

15
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.590
That will help us unlock
the full power of Excel.

16
00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.730
Alongside that, we're going to

17
00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.000
cover a comprehensive
range of functions,

18
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.200
the manipulating and
cleaning text data.

19
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.780
This is really important
because we can't probably

20
00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.310
analyze data if it's invalid
or advanced suitable format.

21
00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.860
Absolutely. Can you give us
some examples of the types

22
00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.330
of text functions we'll be

23
00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.795
looking at and why
we would use them?

24
00:00:58.795 --> 00:01:01.490
Yeah, of course. So
one common problem,

25
00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:05.435
for example, is that we may
need to join texts together.

26
00:01:05.435 --> 00:01:09.560
For example, let's
say you want to do

27
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.660
a lookup on somebody's full name

28
00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.490
and you have the first name
and you have the surname,

29
00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.190
but they're in separate
columns, making impossible.

30
00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.020
We're going to look
at some functions

31
00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.670
like CONCATENATE and TEXTJOIN

32
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.455
that will help us

33
00:01:21.455 --> 00:01:24.230
join text together and
solve this problem.

34
00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.780
I've also encountered
the opposite problem

35
00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.070
where you have two pieces

36
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.155
of information in the same column

37
00:01:30.155 --> 00:01:31.790
and you need to separate them.

38
00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.230
Yeah and that's exactly
what we're going to

39
00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:34.850
look at in our second topic,

40
00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.890
where we are going to
introduce the functions LEFT,

41
00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.880
RIGHT and MID, which
allow us to split data.

42
00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.630
Sounds great. But just

43
00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.520
wondering for the
separating data bit,

44
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.645
can't we just use

45
00:01:44.645 --> 00:01:47.875
the built-in text to columns
tool on the data ribbon?

46
00:01:47.875 --> 00:01:49.190
Look, text to columns is

47
00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.410
a great tool for the
occasional one off,

48
00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.360
but it actually
has two downsides.

49
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.890
First of all, you're
going to have to redo it

50
00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.065
every time you import your data.

51
00:01:57.065 --> 00:02:00.145
The other problem is you
lose your original values.

52
00:02:00.145 --> 00:02:03.290
Our long-term strategy is to
build a workbook which is

53
00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:04.910
totally automated and can be

54
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:06.860
reused every month or every week.

55
00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.300
All you have to do
is put the data

56
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.980
in and Excel does all the rest.

57
00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:13.220
To achieve this, we're going
to need Excel functions.

58
00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.080
I'm convinced. So tell us

59
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.045
more about cleaning data please.

60
00:02:17.045 --> 00:02:20.210
I've had some real issues
with spaces because a lot

61
00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:21.710
of people automatically type

62
00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:23.510
a space at the end of a word.

63
00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.550
But Excel doesn't just ignore

64
00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.675
these spaces and so when
I summarize the data,

65
00:02:28.675 --> 00:02:30.260
I end up with one total for

66
00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.710
Sydney and one total for
Sydney with a space.

67
00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:35.555
I know exactly what you mean.

68
00:02:35.555 --> 00:02:38.930
But the good news is I have
a miracle cure called TRIM,

69
00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.620
which will rid you of all
those problematic spaces.

70
00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.480
We're also going to look at
a function called CLEAN,

71
00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.785
which cleans up a lot of

72
00:02:45.785 --> 00:02:47.300
other weird characters
that look like

73
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.405
spaces but are actually
non-printing characters.

74
00:02:50.405 --> 00:02:54.595
So does CLEAN clean up all
the non-printing characters?

75
00:02:54.595 --> 00:02:56.330
ACtually that's a
common misconception.

76
00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:57.590
It only cleans

77
00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.739
the first 32 non-printing
ASCII characters.

78
00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:01.850
But don't worry, we're also

79
00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:02.930
going to look at
a function called

80
00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.755
SUBSTITUTE that will help
us get rid of the others.

81
00:03:05.755 --> 00:03:08.100
Now you mentioned
ASCII characters.

82
00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.490
For those who haven't
heard this term before,

83
00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:12.700
could you please explain
what they are quickly?

84
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.500
So ASCII is a computer
encoding system

85
00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.700
where every character that we

86
00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.320
see on the screen
is actually given

87
00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.350
a numeric code from
naught to 255.

88
00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.120
So for example, the ASCII code

89
00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.114
for space is actually
the number 32,

90
00:03:25.114 --> 00:03:27.455
whereas a capital A is 65.

91
00:03:27.455 --> 00:03:29.960
Now it's not really
important to know these,

92
00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.640
but we have included

93
00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.885
an ASCII table in the practice
book for your reference.

94
00:03:34.885 --> 00:03:37.860
Thanks Nicki. I am really
excited to get started.

95
00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.084
But we're covering
so much content,

96
00:03:40.084 --> 00:03:42.785
how are our learners
going to remember it all?

97
00:03:42.785 --> 00:03:44.240
Well, that's the best news.

98
00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.620
I mean, they don't
actually have to

99
00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.900
remember the detail of
every single function

100
00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.640
as long as they understand

101
00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.950
the principle of how
the functions work.

102
00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.660
We have a full function library
on the Formulas ribbon.

103
00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.450
Excel's help is excellent

104
00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:00.800
if you need to check
how our function

105
00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.270
works and the functions

106
00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:04.460
themselves actually
guide you with prompts.

107
00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:07.730
We've also provided a fabulous
quick reference guide in

108
00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.575
the toolbox which summarizes

109
00:04:09.575 --> 00:04:11.645
all the functions we're
covering this week.

110
00:04:11.645 --> 00:04:14.180
It also has some useful
keyboard shortcuts and

111
00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:15.560
even some bonus content for

112
00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.455
those who'd like to
dive a little deeper.

113
00:04:17.455 --> 00:04:19.310
So to summarize, these are

114
00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.440
the topics that we'll
be covering this week,

115
00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.690
functions for combining text,

116
00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.995
functions for splitting text,
combining text functions,

117
00:04:27.995 --> 00:04:30.725
cleaning data and changing case,

118
00:04:30.725 --> 00:04:33.935
removing and replacing
unwanted characters.

119
00:04:33.935 --> 00:04:36.220
Each topic has a
great training video

120
00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.140
for you to watch
and you will get a

121
00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:39.980
lot more out of
them if you follow

122
00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:42.620
along in the practice
workbooks provided.

123
00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.855
There is a workbook
for each video,

124
00:04:44.855 --> 00:04:47.330
but you can keep working
in the same workbook from

125
00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:48.950
the previous exercise as

126
00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.320
long as you've completed
all the activities.

127
00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.810
After each video, there
is a quiz for you to

128
00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.090
test your knowledge and
at the end of the week,

129
00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:57.680
we have a practice
challenge for you to

130
00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.390
practice all the amazing

131
00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:01.475
new skills that you have learned.

132
00:05:01.475 --> 00:05:04.830
Now it's over to you.
