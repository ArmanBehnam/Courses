00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:03.060
if the basic technical idea is behind

2
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.700
deep learning behind your networks have

3
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.470
been around for decades why are they

4
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.870
only just now taking off in this video

5
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.090
let's go over some of the main drivers

6
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.130
behind the rise of deep learning because

7
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.170
I think this will help you that the spot

8
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.090
the best opportunities within your own

9
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.850
organization to apply these to over the

10
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.439
last few years a lot of people have

11
00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.240
asked me Andrew why is deep learning

12
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.820
certainly working so well and when a

13
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.949
marsan question this is usually the

14
00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.109
picture I draw for them let's say we

15
00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.210
plot a figure where on the horizontal

16
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.180
axis we plot the amount of data we have

17
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.270
for a task and let's say on the vertical

18
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.570
axis we plot the performance on above

19
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.430
learning algorithms such as the accuracy

20
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.180
of our spam classifier or our ad click

21
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.960
predictor or the accuracy of our neural

22
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.969
net for figuring out the position of

23
00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.399
other calls for our self-driving car it

24
00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.440
turns out if you plot the performance of

25
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.270
a traditional learning algorithm like

26
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.460
support vector machine or logistic

27
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.710
regression as a function of the amount

28
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.619
of data you have you might get a curve

29
00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.720
that looks like this where the

30
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.670
performance improves for a while as you

31
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.280
add more data but after a while the

32
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.200
performance you know pretty much

33
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.630
plateaus right suppose your horizontal

34
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.180
lines enjoy that very well you know was

35
00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.320
it they didn't know what to do with huge

36
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.140
amounts of data and what happened in our

37
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.689
society over the last 10 years maybe is

38
00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.850
that for a lot of problems we went from

39
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.820
having a relatively small amount of data

40
00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.610
to having you know often a fairly large

41
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.979
amount of data and all of this was

42
00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.979
thanks to the digitization of a society

43
00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.979
where so much human activity is now in

44
00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.720
the digital realm we spend so much time

45
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.180
on the computers on websites on mobile

46
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.320
apps and activities on digital devices

47
00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.960
creates data and thanks to the rise of

48
00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.360
inexpensive cameras built into our cell

49
00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.369
phones accelerometers all sorts of

50
00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.909
sensors in the Internet of Things we

51
00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.890
also just have been collecting one more

52
00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.129
and more data so over the last 20 years

53
00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.870
for a lot of applications we just

54
00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.560
accumulate

55
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.319
a lot more data more than traditional

56
00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:17.550
learning algorithms were able to

57
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.520
effectively take advantage of and what

58
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.560
new network lead turns out that if you

59
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.310
train a small neural net then this

60
00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.470
performance maybe looks like that

61
00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.349
if you train a somewhat larger Internet

62
00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:34.590
that's called as a medium-sized internet

63
00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.330
to fall in something a little bit better

64
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.900
and if you train a very large neural net

65
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.180
then it's the form and often just keeps

66
00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.580
getting better and better so couple

67
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.890
observations one is if you want to hit

68
00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.410
this very high level of performance then

69
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.620
you need two things first often you need

70
00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.420
to be able to train a big enough neural

71
00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.360
network in order to take advantage of

72
00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.670
the huge amount of data and second you

73
00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.010
need to be out here on the x axes you do

74
00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.430
need a lot of data so we often say that

75
00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.799
scale has been driving deep learning

76
00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:10.860
progress and by scale I mean both the

77
00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.900
size of the neural network we need just

78
00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.150
a new network a lot of hidden units a

79
00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.069
lot of parameters a lot of connections

80
00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:21.480
as well as scale of the data in fact

81
00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.910
today one of the most reliable ways to

82
00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.440
get better performance in the neural

83
00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.390
network is often to either train a

84
00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.940
bigger network or throw more data at it

85
00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.829
and that only works up to a point

86
00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:33.359
because eventually you run out of data

87
00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:35.640
or eventually then your network is so

88
00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.769
big that it takes too long to train but

89
00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.200
just improving scale has actually taken

90
00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.690
us a long way in the world of learning

91
00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.810
in order to make this diagram a bit more

92
00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.060
technically precise and just add a few

93
00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.920
more things I wrote the amount of data

94
00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.040
on the x-axis technically this is amount

95
00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.900
of labeled data where by label data

96
00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.180
I mean training examples we have both

97
00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.630
the input X and the label Y I went to

98
00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.910
introduce a little bit of notation that

99
00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.709
we'll use later in this course we're

100
00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.769
going to use lowercase alphabet to

101
00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:12.540
denote the size of my training sets or

102
00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:13.739
the number of training examples

103
00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:15.690
this lowercase M so that's the

104
00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.989
horizontal axis couple other details to

105
00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:20.310
this Tigger

106
00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.340
in this regime of smaller training sets

107
00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.970
the relative ordering of the algorithms

108
00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.700
is actually not very well defined so if

109
00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.590
you don't have a lot of training data is

110
00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.500
often up to your skill at hand

111
00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.510
engineering features that determines the

112
00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.090
foreman so it's quite possible that if

113
00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.910
someone training an SVM is more

114
00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.070
motivated to hand engineer features and

115
00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.320
someone training even large their own

116
00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.300
that may be in this small training set

117
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.730
regime the SEM could do better

118
00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:53.130
so you know in this region to the left

119
00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.020
of the figure the relative ordering

120
00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.090
between gene algorithms is not that well

121
00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.550
defined and performance depends much

122
00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.919
more on your skill at engine features

123
00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:03.389
and other mobile details of the

124
00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:05.970
algorithms and there's only in this some

125
00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.850
big data regime very large training sets

126
00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:12.000
very large M regime in the right that we

127
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.669
more consistently see largely Ronettes

128
00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:17.639
dominating the other approaches and so

129
00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:19.560
if any of your friends ask you why are

130
00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.600
known as you know taking off I would

131
00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.700
encourage you to draw this picture for

132
00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.729
them as well so I will say that in the

133
00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:28.890
early days in their modern rise of deep

134
00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:29.310
learning

135
00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:32.070
it was scaled data and scale of

136
00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:34.919
computation just our ability to Train

137
00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:36.330
very large dinner networks

138
00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.479
either on a CPU or GPU that enabled us

139
00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:41.850
to make a lot of progress but

140
00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:43.590
increasingly especially in the last

141
00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.800
several years we've seen tremendous

142
00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.360
algorithmic innovation as well so I also

143
00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.539
don't want to understate that

144
00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:53.700
interestingly many of the algorithmic

145
00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:56.940
innovations have been about trying to

146
00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:01.139
make neural networks run much faster so

147
00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:03.510
as a concrete example one of the huge

148
00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:05.310
breakthroughs in your networks has been

149
00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:08.729
switching from a sigmoid function which

150
00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:12.330
looks like this to a railer function

151
00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.760
which we talked about briefly in an

152
00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:18.479
early video that looks like this if you

153
00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:20.190
don't understand the details of one

154
00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:22.260
about the state don't worry about it but

155
00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.389
it turns out that one of the problems of

156
00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:26.010
using sigmoid functions and machine

157
00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:27.870
learning is that there these regions

158
00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:29.520
here where the slope of the function

159
00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:30.280
would

160
00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.920
gradient is nearly zero and so learning

161
00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:35.350
becomes really slow because when you

162
00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:37.060
implement gradient descent and gradient

163
00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:39.639
is zero the parameters just change very

164
00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:41.470
slowly and so learning is very slow

165
00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:44.740
whereas by changing the what's called

166
00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:46.450
the activation function the neural

167
00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:48.600
network to use this function called the

168
00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:52.060
value function of the rectified linear

169
00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:54.970
unit our elu the gradient is equal to

170
00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:57.070
one for all positive values of input

171
00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:00.220
right and so the gradient is much less

172
00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:03.100
likely to gradually shrink to zero and

173
00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:04.750
the gradient here the slope of this line

174
00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:07.300
is zero on the left but it turns out

175
00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:09.520
that just by switching to the sigmoid

176
00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:12.580
function to the rayleigh function has

177
00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:14.410
made an algorithm called gradient

178
00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:16.960
descent work much faster and so this is

179
00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.169
an example of maybe relatively simple

180
00:07:19.169 --> 00:07:22.030
algorithm in Bayesian but ultimately the

181
00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:23.860
impact of this algorithmic innovation

182
00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:27.520
was it really hope computation so the

183
00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.080
regimen quite a lot of examples like

184
00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:31.240
this of where we change the algorithm

185
00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:33.340
because it allows that code to run much

186
00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:35.140
faster and this allows us to train

187
00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:37.479
bigger neural networks or to do so the

188
00:07:37.479 --> 00:07:39.520
reason or multi-client even when we have

189
00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:42.250
a large network roam all the data the

190
00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:45.810
other reason that fast computation is

191
00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:48.610
important is that it turns out the

192
00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:51.070
process of training your network this is

193
00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:53.710
very intuitive often you have an idea

194
00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:56.350
for a neural network architecture and so

195
00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:58.020
you implement your idea and code

196
00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:01.060
implementing your idea then lets you run

197
00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:02.830
an experiment which tells you how well

198
00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:05.050
your neural network does and then by

199
00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:07.510
looking at it you go back to change the

200
00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:10.030
details of your new network and then you

201
00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:12.930
go around this circle over and over and

202
00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:15.880
when your new network takes a long time

203
00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:18.550
to Train it just takes a long time to go

204
00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:21.400
around this cycle and there's a huge

205
00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:24.039
difference in your productivity building

206
00:08:24.039 --> 00:08:26.740
effective neural networks when you can

207
00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:29.560
have an idea and try it and see the work

208
00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:34.169
in ten minutes or maybe ammos a day

209
00:08:34.169 --> 00:08:36.370
versus if you've to train your neural

210
00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:39.490
network for a month which sometimes does

211
00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:40.590
happened

212
00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:42.570
because you get a result back you know

213
00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:44.670
in ten minutes or maybe in a day you

214
00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:47.250
should just try a lot more ideas and be

215
00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:49.170
much more likely to discover in your

216
00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:50.610
network and it works well for your

217
00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:53.720
application and so faster computation

218
00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:57.900
has really helped in terms of speeding

219
00:08:57.900 --> 00:08:59.730
up the rate at which you can get an

220
00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:02.610
experimental result back and this has

221
00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:05.400
really helped both practitioners of

222
00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.550
neuro networks as well as researchers

223
00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:10.650
working and deep learning iterate much

224
00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:13.320
faster and improve your ideas much

225
00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:16.589
faster and so all this has also been a

226
00:09:16.589 --> 00:09:18.570
huge boon to the entire deep learning

227
00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:21.029
research community which has been

228
00:09:21.029 --> 00:09:23.370
incredible with just you know inventing

229
00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:25.620
new algorithms and making nonstop

230
00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:28.920
progress on that front so these are some

231
00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:30.990
of the forces powering the rise of deep

232
00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:33.570
learning but the good news is that these

233
00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:36.000
forces are still working powerfully to

234
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.490
make deep learning even better Tech Data

235
00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:41.130
society is still throwing up one more

236
00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:43.800
digital data or take computation with

237
00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:45.660
the rise of specialized hardware like

238
00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:48.300
GPUs and faster networking many types of

239
00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:50.940
hardware I'm actually quite confident

240
00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:53.250
that our ability to do very large neural

241
00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:55.140
networks or should a computation point

242
00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:57.320
of view will keep on getting better and

243
00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:00.360
take algorithms relative learning

244
00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:02.880
research communities though continuously

245
00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:05.070
phenomenal at innovating on the

246
00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:07.680
algorithms front so because of this I

247
00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:09.839
think that we can be optimistic answer

248
00:10:09.839 --> 00:10:11.370
the optimistic the deep learning will

249
00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:13.650
keep on getting better for many years to

250
00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:14.120
come

251
00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:17.100
so that let's go on to the last video of

252
00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:18.540
the section where we'll talk a little

253
00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:20.280
bit more about what you learn from this

254
00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:22.610
