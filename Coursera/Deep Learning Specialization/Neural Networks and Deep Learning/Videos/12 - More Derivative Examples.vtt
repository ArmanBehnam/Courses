00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.105
In this video, I'll show you a
slightly more complex example

2
00:00:03.105 --> 00:00:06.870
where the slope of the function can be
different to different points in the function.

3
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.125
Let's start with an example.

4
00:00:08.125 --> 00:00:11.888
You have plotted the function f(a) = a².

5
00:00:11.888 --> 00:00:15.975
Let's take a look at the point a=2.

6
00:00:15.975 --> 00:00:19.107
So a² or f(a) = 4.

7
00:00:19.107 --> 00:00:24.490
Let's nudge a slightly to
the right, so now a=2.001.

8
00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:31.580
f(a) which is a² is going to
be approximately 4.004.

9
00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.585
It turns out that the exact value,

10
00:00:33.585 --> 00:00:39.140
you call the calculator and figured
this out is actually 4.004001.

11
00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.120
I'm just going to say
4.004 is close enough.

12
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.430
So what this means is that when a=2,

13
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.825
let's draw this on the plot.

14
00:00:46.825 --> 00:00:49.320
So what we're saying is that if a=2,

15
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:56.225
then f(a) = 4 and here is the
x and y axis are not drawn to scale.

16
00:00:56.225 --> 00:00:59.480
Technically, does vertical height
should be much higher than

17
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.540
this horizontal height so the
x and y axis are not on the same scale.

18
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:10.865
But if I now nudge a to 2.001
then f(a) becomes roughly 4.004.

19
00:01:10.865 --> 00:01:13.864
So if we draw this little triangle again,

20
00:01:13.864 --> 00:01:18.675
what this means is that if
I nudge a to the right by 0.001,

21
00:01:18.675 --> 00:01:23.238
f(a) goes up four times as much by 0.004.

22
00:01:23.238 --> 00:01:25.170
So in the language of calculus,

23
00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.880
we say that a slope that is
the derivative of f(a) at

24
00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.840
a=2 is 4 or to write this out
of our calculus notation,

25
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.750
we say that d/da of f(a) = 4 when a=2.

26
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.200
Now one thing about this function f(a) = a²

27
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.530
is that the slope is different
for different values of a.

28
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.970
This is different than the example
we saw on the previous slide.

29
00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.650
So let's look at a different point.

30
00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.721
If a=5, so instead of a=2,

31
00:01:58.721 --> 00:02:04.880
and now a=5 then a²=25, so that's f(a).

32
00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.205
If I nudge a to the right again,

33
00:02:07.205 --> 00:02:09.129
it's tiny little nudge to a,

34
00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:18.555
so now a=5.001 then f(a) will be
approximately 25.010.

35
00:02:18.555 --> 00:02:23.550
So what we see is that by
nudging a up by .001,

36
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.620
f(a) goes up ten times as much.

37
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.960
So we have that d/da f(a) = 10 when

38
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.690
a=5 because f(a) goes up ten times as

39
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.910
much as a does when I make a
tiny little nudge to a.

40
00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.040
So one way to see why did derivatives is
different at different points is that if you

41
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.285
draw that little triangle right at
different locations on this,

42
00:02:45.285 --> 00:02:49.080
you'll see that the ratio of the
height of the triangle over

43
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.280
the width of the triangle is very
different at different points on the curve.

44
00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:59.880
So here, the slope=4
when a=2, a=10, when a=5.

45
00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.670
Now if you pull up a calculus textbook,

46
00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.867
a calculus textbook will
tell you that d/da of f(a),

47
00:03:06.867 --> 00:03:08.259
so f(a) = a²,

48
00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:09.929
so that's d/da of a².

49
00:03:09.929 --> 00:03:13.410
One of the formulas you find are
the calculus textbook is that this thing,

50
00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.740
the slope of the function a²,
is equal to 2a.

51
00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.200
Not going to prove this, but
the way you find this out is that

52
00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.170
you open up a calculus textbook to

53
00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:28.135
the table formulas and they'll tell you
that derivative of 2 of a² is 2a.

54
00:03:28.135 --> 00:03:31.575
And indeed, this is consistent with
what we've worked out.

55
00:03:31.575 --> 00:03:39.460
Namely, when a=2, the slope of
function to a is 2x2=4.

56
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:46.243
And when a=5 then the slope of
the function 2xa is 2x5=10.

57
00:03:46.243 --> 00:03:50.430
So, if you ever pull up a calculus
textbook and you see this formula,

58
00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.270
that the derivative of a²=2a,

59
00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.615
all that means is that for
any given value of a,

60
00:03:57.615 --> 00:04:04.695
if you nudge upward by 0.001
already your tiny little value,

61
00:04:04.695 --> 00:04:09.550
you will expect f(a) to go up by 2a.

62
00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:12.700
That is the slope or the derivative times

63
00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.660
other much you had nudged
to the right the value of a.

64
00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.540
Now one tiny little detail,

65
00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:23.130
I use these approximate symbols here
and this wasn't exactly 4.004,

66
00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.515
there's an extra .001 hanging out there.

67
00:04:26.515 --> 00:04:29.226
It turns out that this extra .001,

68
00:04:29.226 --> 00:04:34.370
this little thing here is because
we were nudging a to the right by 0.001,

69
00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.530
if we're instead nudging it
to the right by

70
00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:43.290
this infinitesimally small value
then this extra every term will go

71
00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:48.060
away and you find that the amount that
f(a) goes out is exactly equal

72
00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:53.335
to the derivative times the amount
that you nudge a to the right.

73
00:04:53.335 --> 00:04:59.295
And the reason why is not 4.004 exactly is
because derivatives are defined using

74
00:04:59.295 --> 00:05:05.774
this infinitesimally small nudges to a
rather than 0.001 which is not.

75
00:05:05.774 --> 00:05:08.070
And while 0.001 is small,

76
00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:09.865
it's not infinitesimally small.

77
00:05:09.865 --> 00:05:13.730
So that's why the amount that
f(a) went up isn't exactly given

78
00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:17.720
by the formula but it's only a kind of
approximately given by the derivative.

79
00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.034
To wrap up this video,

80
00:05:19.034 --> 00:05:21.945
let's just go through a
few more quick examples.

81
00:05:21.945 --> 00:05:27.980
The example you've already seen
is that if f(a) = a² then

82
00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:34.460
the calculus textbooks formula table will
tell you that the derivative is equal to 2a.

83
00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:38.300
And so the example we went through
was it if (a) = 2,

84
00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.930
f(a) = 4, and we nudge a,

85
00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:45.350
since it's a little bit
bigger than f(a) is about

86
00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:51.160
4.004 and so f(a) went up four times
as much and indeed when a=2,

87
00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.660
the derivatives is equal to 4.

88
00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:55.600
Let's look at some other examples.

89
00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.880
Let's say, instead the f(a) = a³.

90
00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:03.380
If you go to a calculus textbook
and look up the table of formulas,

91
00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.070
you see that the slope of
this function, again,

92
00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:10.000
the derivative of this function
is equal to 3a².

93
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.335
So you can get this formula
out of the calculus textbook.

94
00:06:14.335 --> 00:06:16.850
So what this means?

95
00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:19.430
So the way to interpret
this is as follows.

96
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:21.725
Let's take a=2 as an example again.

97
00:06:21.725 --> 00:06:27.560
So f(a) or a³=8, that's
two to the power of three.

98
00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.570
So we give a a tiny little nudge,

99
00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:37.160
you find that f(a) is about 8.012
and feel free to check this.

100
00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:40.070
Take 2.001 to the power of three,

101
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:41.330
you find this is very close to 8.012.

102
00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:49.463
And indeed, when a=2 that's
3x2² does equal to 3x4,

103
00:06:49.463 --> 00:06:50.750
you see that's 12.

104
00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:55.255
So the derivative formula predicts that if
you nudge a to the right by tiny little bit,

105
00:06:55.255 --> 00:06:58.464
f(a) should go up 12 times as much.

106
00:06:58.464 --> 00:07:01.950
And indeed, this is true
when a went up by .001,

107
00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:06.447
f(a) went up 12 times as much by .012.

108
00:07:06.447 --> 00:07:08.960
Just one last example
and then we'll wrap up.

109
00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.190
Let's say that f(a) is equal to
the log function.

110
00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:14.690
So on the right log of a,

111
00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:17.595
I'm going to use this as
the base e logarithm.

112
00:07:17.595 --> 00:07:20.755
So some people write that as log(a).

113
00:07:20.755 --> 00:07:22.420
So if you go to calculus textbook,

114
00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:26.465
you find that when you take the
derivative of log(a).

115
00:07:26.465 --> 00:07:30.005
So this is a function that
just looks like that,

116
00:07:30.005 --> 00:07:34.645
the slope of this function is
given by 1/a.

117
00:07:34.645 --> 00:07:40.430
So the way to interpret this is that
if a has any value then let's just keep

118
00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:46.865
using a=2 as an example and you
nudge a to the right by .001,

119
00:07:46.865 --> 00:07:51.005
you would expect f(a) to go up by

120
00:07:51.005 --> 00:07:56.470
1/a that is by the derivative times
the amount that you increase a.

121
00:07:56.470 --> 00:08:00.380
So in fact, if you pull up a calculator,

122
00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:02.795
you find that if a=2,

123
00:08:02.795 --> 00:08:10.850
f(a) is about 0.69315 and if you

124
00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:21.617
increase f and if you increase a to
2.001 then f(a) is about 0.69365,

125
00:08:21.617 --> 00:08:27.220
this has gone up by 0.0005.

126
00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:32.150
And indeed, if you look at the formula
for the derivative when a=2,

127
00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:36.280
d/da f(a) = 1/2.

128
00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:41.720
So this derivative formula predicts
that if you pump up a by .001,

129
00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:46.230
you would expect f(a) to go up by
only 1/2 as much and 1/2 of .001

130
00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:51.250
is 0.0005 which is exactly what we got.

131
00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:56.180
Then when a goes up by .001,
going from a=2 to

132
00:08:56.180 --> 00:09:01.095
a=2.001, f(a) goes up by half as much.

133
00:09:01.095 --> 00:09:04.980
So, the answers are going up by
approximately .0005.

134
00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:08.510
So if we draw that little triangle
if you will is that if on

135
00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:13.450
the horizontal axis just goes up by
.001 on the vertical axis,

136
00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:18.217
log(a) goes up by half of that so .0005.

137
00:09:18.217 --> 00:09:22.585
And so that 1/a or 1/2 in this case,

138
00:09:22.585 --> 00:09:27.770
1a=2 that's just the slope of
this line when a=2.

139
00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:30.290
So that's it for derivatives.

140
00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:32.660
There are just two take home messages
from this video.

141
00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:36.800
First is that the derivative of the
function just means the slope of

142
00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:39.110
a function and the slope of a function

143
00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:41.830
can be different at different
points on the function.

144
00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:45.635
In our first example where
f(a) = 3a those a straight line.

145
00:09:45.635 --> 00:09:47.400
The derivative was the same everywhere,

146
00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:48.885
it was three everywhere.

147
00:09:48.885 --> 00:09:52.790
For other functions like
f(a) = a² or f(a) = log(a),

148
00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:54.920
the slope of the line varies.

149
00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:59.410
So, the slope or the derivative can be
different at different points on the curve.

150
00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:00.723
So that's a first take away.

151
00:10:00.723 --> 00:10:03.150
Derivative just means slope of a line.

152
00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:06.930
Second takeaway is that if you want to
look up the derivative of a function,

153
00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:10.860
you can flip open your calculus textbook
or look up Wikipedia and

154
00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:15.160
often get a formula for the slope of
these functions at different points.

155
00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:20.645
So that, I hope you have an intuitive
understanding of derivatives or slopes of lines.

156
00:10:20.645 --> 00:10:21.862
Let's go into the next video.

157
00:10:21.862 --> 00:10:24.600
We'll start to talk about the
computation graph and how to

158
00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:27.620
use that to compute derivatives of
more complex functions.
