00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.610
So you're just about to reach the end of

2
00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.165
the first week of material on the first course in this specialization.

3
00:00:06.165 --> 00:00:09.960
Let me give you a quick sense of what you'll learn in the next few weeks as well.

4
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.000
As I said in the first video,

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.150
this specialization comprises five courses.

6
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.250
And right now, we're in the first of

7
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.385
these five courses which teach you the most important foundations,

8
00:00:20.385 --> 00:00:23.745
really the most important building blocks of deep learning.

9
00:00:23.745 --> 00:00:25.530
So by the end of this first course,

10
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:30.350
you know how to build and get to work a deep neural network.

11
00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.780
So here the details of what is in this first course.

12
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.725
This course is four weeks of material.

13
00:00:35.725 --> 00:00:37.620
And you're just coming up to the end of

14
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.110
the first week when you saw an introduction to deep learning.

15
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.530
At the end of each week,

16
00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.190
there are also be 10 multiple-choice questions that

17
00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.495
you can use to double check your understanding of the material.

18
00:00:47.495 --> 00:00:49.185
So when you're done watching this video,

19
00:00:49.185 --> 00:00:51.860
I hope you're going to take a look at those questions.

20
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.530
In the second week, you then learn about the Basics of Neural Network Programming.

21
00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.420
You'll learn the structure of what we

22
00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.960
call the forward propagation and the back propagation

23
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.030
steps of the algorithm and how to implement neural networks efficiently.

24
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.405
Starting from the second week,

25
00:01:07.405 --> 00:01:10.125
you also get to do a programming exercise

26
00:01:10.125 --> 00:01:13.605
that lets you practice the material you've just learned,

27
00:01:13.605 --> 00:01:16.735
implement the algorithms yourself and see it work for yourself.

28
00:01:16.735 --> 00:01:19.550
I find it really satisfying when I learn about algorithm and they

29
00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.375
get it coded up and I see it worked for myself.

30
00:01:22.375 --> 00:01:24.080
So I hope you enjoy that too.

31
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.140
Having learned the framework for neural network programming in the third week,

32
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.050
you code up a single hidden layer neural network. All right.

33
00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.470
So you learn about all the key concepts needed

34
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.005
to implement and get to work in neural network.

35
00:01:37.005 --> 00:01:38.485
And then finally in week four,

36
00:01:38.485 --> 00:01:41.175
you build a deep neural network and neural network with

37
00:01:41.175 --> 00:01:44.081
many layers and see it worked for yourself.

38
00:01:44.081 --> 00:01:47.930
So, congratulations on finishing the videos after this one.

39
00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.600
I hope that you now have a good high-level sense of what's happening in deep learning.

40
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.610
And perhaps some of you are also assigned to,

41
00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.355
has some ideas of where you might want to apply deep learning yourself.

42
00:01:57.355 --> 00:01:59.370
So, I hope that after this video,

43
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.850
you go on to take a look at the 10 multiple choice questions that follow this video

44
00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.500
on the course website and just use

45
00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.760
the 10 multiple choice questions to check your understanding.

46
00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.199
And don't review, you don't get all the answers right the first time,

47
00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:14.710
you can try again and again until you get them all right.

48
00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:19.145
I found them useful to make sure that I'm understanding all the concepts,

49
00:02:19.145 --> 00:02:21.465
I hope you're that way too.

50
00:02:21.465 --> 00:02:24.000
So with that, congrats again for getting up to

51
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.670
here and I look forward to seeing you in the week two videos.
