00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:01.280
In the last video,

2
00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:06.130
we worked through an example of using a
computation graph to compute a function J.

3
00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:09.311
Now, let's take a clean diversion
of that computation graph.

4
00:00:09.311 --> 00:00:13.990
And show how you can use it to figure
out derivative calculations for

5
00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:15.252
that function J.

6
00:00:15.252 --> 00:00:17.292
So here's a computation graph.

7
00:00:17.292 --> 00:00:22.280
Let's say you want to compute
the derivative of J with respect to v.

8
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.126
So what is that?

9
00:00:24.126 --> 00:00:27.800
Well, this says,
if we were to take this value of v and

10
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.360
change it a little bit,
how would the value of J change?

11
00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.553
Well, J is defined as 3 times v.

12
00:00:37.553 --> 00:00:42.895
And right now, v = 11.

13
00:00:42.895 --> 00:00:48.348
So if we're to bump up v
by a little bit to 11.001,

14
00:00:48.348 --> 00:00:52.524
then J, which is 3v, so currently 33,

15
00:00:52.524 --> 00:00:56.130
will get bumped up to 33.003.

16
00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.123
So here, we've increased v by 0.001.

17
00:00:59.123 --> 00:01:03.640
And the net result of that is
that J goes out 3 times as much.

18
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.099
So the derivative of J with
respect to v is equal to 3.

19
00:01:08.099 --> 00:01:12.590
Because the increase in J is
3 times the increase in v.

20
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:18.221
And in fact,
this is very analogous to the example

21
00:01:18.221 --> 00:01:24.670
we had in the previous video,
where we had f(a) = 3a.

22
00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:30.765
And so we then derived that df/da,
which with slightly simplified,

23
00:01:30.765 --> 00:01:36.740
a slightly sloppy notation,
you can write as df/da = 3.

24
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.829
So instead, here we have J = 3v,

25
00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:44.825
and so dJ/dv = 3.

26
00:01:44.825 --> 00:01:51.713
With here, J playing the role of f, and

27
00:01:51.713 --> 00:01:58.323
v playing the role of a in this previous
example that we had from an earlier video.

28
00:01:58.323 --> 00:02:03.595
So indeed, terminology of backpropagation,
what we're seeing

29
00:02:03.595 --> 00:02:09.617
is that if you want to compute the
derivative of this final output variable,

30
00:02:09.617 --> 00:02:13.475
which usually is a variable
you care most about,

31
00:02:13.475 --> 00:02:18.790
with respect to v, then we've
done one step of backpropagation.

32
00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.240
So we call it one step
backwards in this graph.

33
00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.280
Now let's look at another example.

34
00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.180
What is dJ/da?

35
00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.670
In other words, if we bump up the value of
a, how does that affect the value of J?

36
00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.965
Well, let's go through the example,
where now a = 5.

37
00:02:39.965 --> 00:02:42.850
So let's bump it up to 5.001.

38
00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:48.790
The net impact of that is that v, which
was a + u, so that was previously 11.

39
00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.359
This would get increased to 11.001.

40
00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:57.224
And then we've already seen as above that

41
00:02:57.224 --> 00:03:01.672
J now gets bumped up to 33.003.

42
00:03:01.672 --> 00:03:07.591
So what we're seeing is that if you
increase a by 0.001, J increases by 0.003.

43
00:03:07.591 --> 00:03:11.751
And by increase a, I mean,
you have to take this value of 5 and

44
00:03:11.751 --> 00:03:14.100
just plug in a new value.

45
00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.954
Then the change to a will propagate to
the right of the computation graph so

46
00:03:17.954 --> 00:03:19.832
that J ends up being 33.003.

47
00:03:19.832 --> 00:03:28.110
And so the increase to J is
3 times the increase to a.

48
00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.520
So that means this
derivative is equal to 3.

49
00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:37.400
And one way to break this down
is to say that if you change a,

50
00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.910
then that will change v.

51
00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.967
And through changing v,
that would change J.

52
00:03:43.967 --> 00:03:49.554
And so the net change to the value
of J when you bump up the value,

53
00:03:49.554 --> 00:03:54.313
when you nudge the value of
a up a little bit, is that,

54
00:03:57.699 --> 00:04:02.561
First, by changing a,
you end up increasing v.

55
00:04:02.561 --> 00:04:05.850
Well, how much does v increase?

56
00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:11.709
It is increased by an amount
that's determined by dv/da.

57
00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:19.802
And then the change in v will cause
the value of J to also increase.

58
00:04:19.802 --> 00:04:27.064
So in calculus, this is actually called
the chain rule that if a affects v,

59
00:04:27.064 --> 00:04:32.023
affects J,
then the amounts that J changes when you

60
00:04:32.023 --> 00:04:36.866
nudge a is the product of
how much v changes when you

61
00:04:36.866 --> 00:04:42.165
nudge a times how much J
changes when you nudge v.

62
00:04:42.165 --> 00:04:46.225
So in calculus, again,
this is called the chain rule.

63
00:04:46.225 --> 00:04:52.140
And what we saw from this calculation
is that if you increase a by 0.001,

64
00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:55.250
v changes by the same amount.

65
00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:59.650
So dv/da = 1.

66
00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:07.774
So in fact, if you plug in what
we have wrapped up previously,

67
00:05:07.774 --> 00:05:11.700
dv/dJ = 3 and dv/da = 1.

68
00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.160
So the product of these 3 times 1,

69
00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.350
that actually gives you
the correct value that dJ/da = 3.

70
00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:24.963
So this little illustration shows
hows by having computed dJ/dv,

71
00:05:24.963 --> 00:05:30.183
that is,
derivative with respect to this variable,

72
00:05:30.183 --> 00:05:34.030
it can then help you to compute dJ/da.

73
00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:37.270
And so that's another step of
this backward calculation.

74
00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:44.115
I just want to introduce one
more new notational convention.

75
00:05:44.115 --> 00:05:50.005
Which is that when you're witting
codes to implement backpropagation,

76
00:05:50.005 --> 00:05:54.675
there will usually be some final output
variable that you really care about.

77
00:05:54.675 --> 00:06:01.065
So a final output variable that you really
care about or that you want to optimize.

78
00:06:01.065 --> 00:06:04.100
And in this case,
this final output variable is J.

79
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.460
It's really the last node
in your computation graph.

80
00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:11.870
And so a lot of computations will be
trying to compute the derivative of that

81
00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:13.343
final output variable.

82
00:06:13.343 --> 00:06:17.100
So d of this final output variable
with respect to some other variable.

83
00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:23.319
Then we just call that dvar.

84
00:06:23.319 --> 00:06:27.909
So a lot of the computations you have will
be to compute the derivative of the final

85
00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:32.164
output variable, J in this case,
with various intermediate variables,

86
00:06:32.164 --> 00:06:34.520
such as a, b, c, u or v.

87
00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:41.280
And when you implement this in software,
what do you call this variable name?

88
00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:44.208
One thing you could do is in Python,

89
00:06:44.208 --> 00:06:50.280
you could give us a very long variable
name like dFinalOurputVar/dvar.

90
00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:51.766
But that's a very long variable name.

91
00:06:51.766 --> 00:06:55.018
You could call this, I guess, dJdvar.

92
00:06:55.018 --> 00:06:58.929
But because you're always taking
derivatives with respect to dJ, with

93
00:06:58.929 --> 00:07:03.173
respect to this final output variable,
I'm going to introduce a new notation.

94
00:07:03.173 --> 00:07:09.635
Where, in code, when you're computing
this thing in the code you write,

95
00:07:09.635 --> 00:07:16.936
we're just going to use the variable name
dvar in order to represent that quantity.

96
00:07:16.936 --> 00:07:21.459
So dvar in a code you write will
represent the derivative of

97
00:07:21.459 --> 00:07:25.444
the final output variable
you care about such as J.

98
00:07:25.444 --> 00:07:29.938
Well, sometimes, the last l with respect
to the various intermediate quantities

99
00:07:29.938 --> 00:07:31.795
you're computing in your code.

100
00:07:31.795 --> 00:07:38.380
So this thing here in your code,
you use dv to denote this value.

101
00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:42.453
So dv would be equal to 3.

102
00:07:42.453 --> 00:07:46.635
And your code, you represent this as da,

103
00:07:46.635 --> 00:07:51.185
which is we also figured
out to be equal to 3.

104
00:07:51.185 --> 00:07:58.018
So we've done backpropagation partially
through this computation graph.

105
00:07:58.018 --> 00:08:02.130
Let's go through the rest of
this example on the next slide.

106
00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:06.293
So let's go to a cleaned up
copy of the computation graph.

107
00:08:06.293 --> 00:08:09.846
And just to recap, what we've done so

108
00:08:09.846 --> 00:08:14.743
far is go backward here and
figured out that dv = 3.

109
00:08:14.743 --> 00:08:18.783
And again, the definition of dv,
that's just a variable name,

110
00:08:18.783 --> 00:08:20.844
where the code is really dJ/dv.

111
00:08:20.844 --> 00:08:24.303
We've figured out that da = 3.

112
00:08:24.303 --> 00:08:30.470
And again, da is the variable name in your
code and that's really the value dJ/da.

113
00:08:32.332 --> 00:08:39.410
And we hand wave how we've gone
backwards on these two edges like so.

114
00:08:39.410 --> 00:08:41.262
Now let's keep computing derivatives.

115
00:08:41.262 --> 00:08:44.129
Now let's look at the value u.

116
00:08:44.129 --> 00:08:47.473
So what is dJ/du?

117
00:08:47.473 --> 00:08:52.153
Well, through a similar calculation
as what we did before and

118
00:08:52.153 --> 00:08:54.430
then we start off with u = 6.

119
00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:57.913
If you bump up u to 6.001, then v,

120
00:08:57.913 --> 00:09:02.700
which is previously 11, goes up to 11.001.

121
00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:07.978
And so J goes from 33 to 33.003.

122
00:09:07.978 --> 00:09:12.190
And so the increase in J is 3x,
so this is equal.

123
00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:16.760
And the analysis for u is very
similar to the analysis we did for a.

124
00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:23.884
This is actually computed
as dJ/dv times dv/du,

125
00:09:23.884 --> 00:09:30.186
where this we had already
figured out was 3.

126
00:09:30.186 --> 00:09:33.800
And this turns out to be equal to 1.

127
00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:36.950
So we've gone up one more
step of backpropagation.

128
00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:42.920
We end up computing that
du is also equal to 3.

129
00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:47.240
And du is, of course, just this dJ/du.

130
00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:51.570
Now we just step through
one last example in detail.

131
00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:54.137
So what is dJ/db?

132
00:09:54.137 --> 00:09:57.255
So here, imagine if you are allowed
to change the value of b.

133
00:09:57.255 --> 00:10:01.585
And you want to tweak b a little
bit in order to minimize or

134
00:10:01.585 --> 00:10:04.040
maximize the value of J.

135
00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:05.340
So what is the derivative or

136
00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:10.860
what's the slope of this function J when
you change the value of b a little bit?

137
00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:15.257
It turns out that using the chain rule for
calculus,

138
00:10:15.257 --> 00:10:18.416
this can be written as
the product of two things.

139
00:10:18.416 --> 00:10:24.720
This dJ/du times du/db.

140
00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:30.390
And the reasoning is if
you change b a little bit,

141
00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:34.275
so b = 3 to, say, 3.001.

142
00:10:34.275 --> 00:10:38.041
The way that it will affect
J is it will first affect u.

143
00:10:38.041 --> 00:10:40.120
So how much does it affect u?

144
00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:44.100
Well, u is defined as b times c.

145
00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:48.073
So this will go from 6,

146
00:10:48.073 --> 00:10:53.238
when b = 3, to now 6.002

147
00:10:53.238 --> 00:10:59.560
because c = 2 in our example here.

148
00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:05.150
And so this tells us that du/db = 2.

149
00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:10.490
Because when you bump up b by 0.001,
u increases twice as much.

150
00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:15.360
So du/db, this is equal to 2.

151
00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:21.430
And now, we know that u has gone
up twice as much as b has gone up.

152
00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:24.460
Well, what is dJ/du?

153
00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:27.447
We've already figured out
that this is equal to 3.

154
00:11:27.447 --> 00:11:32.850
And so by multiplying these two out,
we find that dJ/db = 6.

155
00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:36.274
And again, here's the reasoning for
the second part of the argument.

156
00:11:36.274 --> 00:11:43.370
Which is we want to know when u goes
up by 0.002, how does that affect J?

157
00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:48.746
The fact that dJ/du = 3,
that tells us that when

158
00:11:48.746 --> 00:11:54.310
u goes up by 0.002,
J goes up 3 times as much.

159
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:59.943
So J should go up by 0.006.

160
00:11:59.943 --> 00:12:05.670
So this comes from
the fact that dJ/du = 3.

161
00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:09.351
And if you check the math in detail,

162
00:12:09.351 --> 00:12:13.891
you will find that if b becomes 3.001,

163
00:12:13.891 --> 00:12:20.190
then u becomes 6.002, v becomes 11.002.

164
00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:24.064
So that's a + u, so that's 5 + u.

165
00:12:24.064 --> 00:12:28.450
And then J, which is equal to 3 times v,

166
00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:33.101
that ends up being equal to 33.006.

167
00:12:33.101 --> 00:12:37.695
And so that's how you get that dJ/db = 6.

168
00:12:37.695 --> 00:12:43.738
And to fill that in, this is if we
go backwards, so this is db = 6.

169
00:12:43.738 --> 00:12:50.347
And db really is the Python
code variable name for dJ/db.

170
00:12:50.347 --> 00:12:53.565
And I won't go through the last
example in great detail.

171
00:12:53.565 --> 00:13:00.423
But it turns out that if
you also compute out dJ,

172
00:13:00.423 --> 00:13:05.748
this turns out to be dJ/du times du.

173
00:13:05.748 --> 00:13:09.987
And this turns out to be 9,
this turns out to be 3 times 3.

174
00:13:09.987 --> 00:13:11.950
I won't go through that example in detail.

175
00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:18.720
So through this last step, it is
possible to derive that dc is equal to.

176
00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:24.634
So the key takeaway from this video,
from this example, is that when computing

177
00:13:24.634 --> 00:13:29.347
derivatives and computing all of these
derivatives, the most efficient way to do

178
00:13:29.347 --> 00:13:34.221
so is through a right to left computation
following the direction of the red arrows.

179
00:13:34.221 --> 00:13:37.780
And in particular, we'll first compute
the derivative with respect to v.

180
00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:40.530
And then that becomes useful for

181
00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:45.410
computing the derivative with respect to
a and the derivative with respect to u.

182
00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:48.070
And then the derivative with respect to u,
for

183
00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:52.020
example, this term over here and
this term over here.

184
00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:55.430
Those in turn become useful for computing
the derivative with respect to b and

185
00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:57.610
the derivative with respect to c.

186
00:13:57.610 --> 00:14:02.370
So that was the computation graph and
how does a forward or left to right

187
00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:07.620
calculation to compute the cost function
such as J that you might want to optimize.

188
00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:12.940
And a backwards or a right to left
calculation to compute derivatives.

189
00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:15.422
If you're not familiar with calculus or
the chain rule,

190
00:14:15.422 --> 00:14:18.382
I know some of those details, but
they've gone by really quickly.

191
00:14:18.382 --> 00:14:21.500
But if you didn't follow all the details,
don't worry about it.

192
00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:22.567
In the next video,

193
00:14:22.567 --> 00:14:26.251
we'll go over this again in
the context of logistic regression.

194
00:14:26.251 --> 00:14:30.337
And show you exactly what you need to do
in order to implement the computations you

195
00:14:30.337 --> 00:14:33.780
need to compute the derivatives
of the logistic regression model.
