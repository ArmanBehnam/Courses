00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.850
There's been a lot of hype
about neural networks.

2
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.170
And perhaps some of that hype is
justified, given how well they're working.

3
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.220
But it turns out that so

4
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.710
far, almost all the economic value created
by neural networks has been through

5
00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:18.970
one type of machine learning,
called supervised learning.

6
00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.120
Let's see what that means, and
let's go over some examples.

7
00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.030
In supervised learning,
you have some input x, and

8
00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:30.210
you want to learn a function
mapping to some output y.

9
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.890
So for example, just now we saw the
housing price prediction application where

10
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.850
you input some features of a home and
try to output or estimate the price y.

11
00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.180
Here are some other examples that neural
networks have been applied to very

12
00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.940
effectively.

13
00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.180
Possibly the single most lucrative
application of deep learning today is

14
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.150
online advertising, maybe not the most
inspiring, but certainly very lucrative,

15
00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:02.770
in which, by inputting information about
an ad to the website it's thinking

16
00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.020
of showing you, and some information
about the user, neural networks have

17
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.700
gotten very good at predicting whether or
not you click on an ad.

18
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:11.770
And by showing you and

19
00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.800
showing users the ads that you are most
likely to click on, this has been

20
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.830
an incredibly lucrative application of
neural networks at multiple companies.

21
00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.040
Because the ability to show you
ads that you're more likely to

22
00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.690
click on has a direct impact on the bottom

23
00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.200
line of some of the very large
online advertising companies.

24
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.150
Computer vision has also made huge
strides in the last several years,

25
00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.050
mostly due to deep learning.

26
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.140
So you might input an image and
want to output an index,

27
00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.290
say from 1 to 1,000 trying
to tell you if this picture,

28
00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.300
it might be any one of,
say a 1000 different images.

29
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.500
So, you might us that for photo tagging.

30
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.520
I think the recent progress in speech
recognition has also been very exciting,

31
00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.910
where you can now input an audio
clip to a neural network, and

32
00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.930
have it output a text transcript.

33
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.400
Machine translation has also made huge
strides thanks to deep learning where now

34
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.400
you can have a neural network input an
English sentence and directly output say,

35
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.010
a Chinese sentence.

36
00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:15.930
And in autonomous driving, you might input
an image, say a picture of what's in

37
00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.600
front of your car as well as some
information from a radar, and

38
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.080
based on that, maybe a neural network
can be trained to tell you the position

39
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.100
of the other cars on the road.

40
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.870
So this becomes a key component
in autonomous driving systems.

41
00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.730
So a lot of the value creation through
neural networks has been through cleverly

42
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.360
selecting what should be x and
what should be y for

43
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:45.000
your particular problem, and then fitting
this supervised learning component into

44
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.660
often a bigger system such
as an autonomous vehicle.

45
00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.880
It turns out that slightly different
types of neural networks are useful for

46
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.960
different applications.

47
00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:00.100
For example, in the real estate
application that we saw in the previous

48
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.520
video, we use a universally standard
neural network architecture, right?

49
00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.510
Maybe for real estate and
online advertising might be a relatively

50
00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.620
standard neural network,
like the one that we saw.

51
00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:19.120
For image applications we'll often
use convolution on neural networks,

52
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.680
often abbreviated CNN.

53
00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.000
And for sequence data.

54
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.840
So for example,
audio has a temporal component, right?

55
00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.990
Audio is played out over time, so
audio is most naturally represented

56
00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:38.110
as a one-dimensional time series or
as a one-dimensional temporal sequence.

57
00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.420
And so for sequence data,
you often use an RNN,

58
00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.810
a recurrent neural network.

59
00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.270
Language, English and Chinese, the
alphabets or the words come one at a time.

60
00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:54.820
So language is also most naturally
represented as sequence data.

61
00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:00.700
And so more complex versions of RNNs
are often used for these applications.

62
00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.360
And then, for more complex applications,
like autonomous driving, where you have

63
00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:09.200
an image, that might suggest more of a CNN
convolution neural network structure and

64
00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.480
radar info which is
something quite different.

65
00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.360
You might end up with a more custom, or

66
00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.880
some more complex,
hybrid neural network architecture.

67
00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:26.100
So, just to be a bit more concrete
about what are the standard CNN and

68
00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.950
RNN architectures.

69
00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.790
So in the literature you might
have seen pictures like this.

70
00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.740
So that's a standard neural net.

71
00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.800
You might have seen pictures like this.

72
00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.830
Well this is an example of a Convolutional
Neural Network, and we'll see in

73
00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.950
a later course exactly what this picture
means and how can you implement this.

74
00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:51.560
But convolutional networks
are often use for image data.

75
00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.100
And you might also have
seen pictures like this.

76
00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.590
And you'll learn how to implement
this in a later course.

77
00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.180
Recurrent neural networks
are very good for

78
00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:06.220
this type of one-dimensional sequence
data that has maybe a temporal component.

79
00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.310
You might also have heard about
applications of machine learning

80
00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.000
to both Structured Data and
Unstructured Data.

81
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.960
Here's what the terms mean.

82
00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.620
Structured Data means
basically databases of data.

83
00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:25.010
So, for example, in housing price
prediction, you might have a database or

84
00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:28.140
the column that tells you the size and
the number of bedrooms.

85
00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:33.460
So, this is structured data, or
in predicting whether or not a user will

86
00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:37.330
click on an ad, you might have information
about the user, such as the age,

87
00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.590
some information about the ad, and then
labels why that you're trying to predict.

88
00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:46.470
So that's structured data,
meaning that each of the features,

89
00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:49.740
such as size of the house,
the number of bedrooms, or

90
00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:54.530
the age of a user,
has a very well defined meaning.

91
00:05:54.530 --> 00:06:00.520
In contrast, unstructured data refers
to things like audio, raw audio,

92
00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:05.790
or images where you might want to
recognize what's in the image or text.

93
00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:09.230
Here the features might be
the pixel values in an image or

94
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:12.190
the individual words in a piece of text.

95
00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:14.330
Historically, it has been much harder for

96
00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:19.480
computers to make sense of unstructured
data compared to structured data.

97
00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:24.270
And the fact the human race has evolved
to be very good at understanding

98
00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:26.270
audio cues as well as images.

99
00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:28.390
And then text was a more recent invention,
but

100
00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:31.760
people are just really good at
interpreting unstructured data.

101
00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:36.800
And so one of the most exciting things
about the rise of neural networks is that,

102
00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:41.280
thanks to deep learning, thanks to neural
networks, computers are now much better

103
00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:46.320
at interpreting unstructured data as
well compared to just a few years ago.

104
00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:51.240
And this creates opportunities for
many new exciting applications that use

105
00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:55.220
speech recognition, image recognition,
natural language processing on text,

106
00:06:56.230 --> 00:07:00.180
much more than was possible even
just two or three years ago.

107
00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:03.940
I think because people have a natural
empathy to understanding unstructured

108
00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:08.250
data, you might hear about neural
network successes on unstructured data

109
00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:13.060
more in the media because it's just cool
when the neural network recognizes a cat.

110
00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:15.750
We all like that, and
we all know what that means.

111
00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:19.290
But it turns out that a lot of short
term economic value that neural

112
00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:24.270
networks are creating has
also been on structured data,

113
00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:28.690
such as much better advertising systems,
much better profit recommendations, and

114
00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:33.730
just a much better ability to
process the giant databases that

115
00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:37.290
many companies have to make
accurate predictions from them.

116
00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:41.230
So in this course, a lot of
the techniques we'll go over will apply

117
00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:44.690
to both structured data and
to unstructured data.

118
00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:46.970
For the purposes of
explaining the algorithms,

119
00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:52.210
we will draw a little bit more on
examples that use unstructured data.

120
00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:56.280
But as you think through applications of
neural networks within your own team I

121
00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:01.360
hope you find both uses for them in
both structured and unstructured data.

122
00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:06.390
So neural networks have transformed
supervised learning and

123
00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:09.500
are creating tremendous economic value.

124
00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:12.910
It turns out though, that the basic
technical ideas behind neural networks

125
00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:16.520
have mostly been around,
sometimes for many decades.

126
00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:20.980
So why is it, then, that they're only
just now taking off and working so well?

127
00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:24.970
In the next video, we'll talk
about why it's only quite recently

128
00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:28.940
that neural networks have become this
incredibly powerful tool that you can use.
