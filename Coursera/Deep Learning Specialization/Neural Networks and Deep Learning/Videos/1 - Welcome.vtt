00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.395
Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:02.395 --> 00:00:03.810
As you probably know,

3
00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.640
deep learning has already transformed

4
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.325
traditional internet businesses like web search and advertising.

5
00:00:09.325 --> 00:00:11.160
But deep learning is also enabling

6
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.085
brand new products and businesses and ways of helping people to be created.

7
00:00:15.085 --> 00:00:17.205
Everything ranging from better healthcare,

8
00:00:17.205 --> 00:00:19.410
where deep learning is getting really good at reading

9
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.935
X-ray images to delivering personalized education,

10
00:00:22.935 --> 00:00:28.320
to precision agriculture, to even self driving cars and many others.

11
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.790
If you want to learn the tools of deep learning and

12
00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.495
be able to apply them to build these amazing things,

13
00:00:33.495 --> 00:00:35.675
I want to help you get there.

14
00:00:35.675 --> 00:00:38.725
When you finish the sequence of courses on Coursera,

15
00:00:38.725 --> 00:00:41.190
called the specialization, you will be able to put

16
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.455
deep learning onto your resume` with confidence.

17
00:00:44.455 --> 00:00:45.615
Over the next decade,

18
00:00:45.615 --> 00:00:50.430
I think all of us have an opportunity to build an amazing world, amazing society,

19
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.004
that is AI powered,

20
00:00:52.004 --> 00:00:57.364
and I hope that you will play a big role in the creation of this AI power society.

21
00:00:57.364 --> 00:01:00.782
So that, let's get started.

22
00:01:00.782 --> 00:01:03.690
I think that AI is the new electricity.

23
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.485
Starting about 100 years ago,

24
00:01:05.485 --> 00:01:10.055
the electrification of our society transformed every major industry,

25
00:01:10.055 --> 00:01:12.430
every ranging from transportation, manufacturing,

26
00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.430
to healthcare, to communications and many more.

27
00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.280
And today, we see a surprisingly clear path

28
00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.225
for AI to bring about an equally big transformation.

29
00:01:22.225 --> 00:01:25.090
And of course, the part of AI that is rising

30
00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.530
rapidly and driving a lot of these developments, is deep learning.

31
00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.630
So today, deep learning is one of the most

32
00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.920
highly sought after skills in technology worlds.

33
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.795
And through this course and a few courses after this one,

34
00:01:37.795 --> 00:01:40.900
I want to help you to gain and master those skills.

35
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.870
So here's what you learn in this sequence of

36
00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.290
courses also called a specialization on Coursera.

37
00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:48.775
In the first course,

38
00:01:48.775 --> 00:01:51.925
you'll learn about the foundations of neural networks,

39
00:01:51.925 --> 00:01:54.555
you'll learn about neural networks and deep learning.

40
00:01:54.555 --> 00:01:56.650
This video that you're watching is part of

41
00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.895
this first course which last four weeks in total.

42
00:01:59.895 --> 00:02:05.450
And each of the five courses in the specialization will be about two to four weeks,

43
00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.490
with most of them actually shorter than four weeks.

44
00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:09.685
But in this first course,

45
00:02:09.685 --> 00:02:12.340
you'll learn how to build a new network including

46
00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.520
a deep neural network and how to train it on data.

47
00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.840
And at the end of this course,

48
00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.445
you'll be able to build a deep neural network to recognize, guess what?

49
00:02:21.445 --> 00:02:23.710
Cats. For some reason,

50
00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.370
there is a cat neem running around in deep learning.

51
00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.020
And so, following tradition in this first course,

52
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.700
we'll build a cat recognizer.

53
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.395
Then in the second course,

54
00:02:35.395 --> 00:02:38.420
you learn about the practical aspects of deep learning.

55
00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.810
So you learn, now that you've built in your network,

56
00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.765
how to actually get it to perform well.

57
00:02:42.765 --> 00:02:46.295
So you learn about hyperparameter tuning, regularization,

58
00:02:46.295 --> 00:02:49.060
how to diagnose bias and variants and advance

59
00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:54.755
optimization algorithms like momentum armrest prop and the ad authorization algorithm.

60
00:02:54.755 --> 00:02:56.645
Sometimes it seems like there's a lot of tuning,

61
00:02:56.645 --> 00:02:59.925
even some black magic and how you build a new network.

62
00:02:59.925 --> 00:03:02.740
So the second course which is just three weeks,

63
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.900
will demystify some of that black magic.

64
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.710
In the third course which is just two weeks,

65
00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.930
you learn how to structure your machine learning project.

66
00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.270
It turns out that the strategy for building

67
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.820
a machine learning system has changed in the era of deep learning.

68
00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.785
So for example, the way you split your data into train,

69
00:03:20.785 --> 00:03:26.095
development or dev also called holdout cross-validation sets and test sets,

70
00:03:26.095 --> 00:03:29.005
has changed in the era of deep learning.

71
00:03:29.005 --> 00:03:31.860
So what are the new best practices for doing that?

72
00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.215
And whether if you were training set and your test come from different distributions,

73
00:03:36.215 --> 00:03:38.760
that's happening a lot more in the era of deep learning.

74
00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.710
So how do you deal with that?

75
00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:44.500
And if you've heard of end to end deep learning,

76
00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.375
you also learn more about that in this third course

77
00:03:48.375 --> 00:03:51.690
and see when you should use it and maybe when you shouldn't.

78
00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.960
The material in this third course is relatively unique.

79
00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.990
I'm going to share of you a lot of the hard one lessons that I've learned,

80
00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:01.860
building and shipping, quite a lot of deep learning products.

81
00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.075
As far as I know,

82
00:04:03.075 --> 00:04:06.420
this is largely material that is not taught in

83
00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.650
most universities that have deep learning courses.

84
00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.266
But I really hope you to get your deep learning systems to work well.

85
00:04:15.266 --> 00:04:16.755
In the next course,

86
00:04:16.755 --> 00:04:22.530
we'll then talk about convolutional neural networks, often abbreviated CNNs.

87
00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:28.670
Convolutional networks or convolutional neural networks are often applied to images.

88
00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:31.439
So you'll learn how to build these models in course four.

89
00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:33.435
Finally, in course five,

90
00:04:33.435 --> 00:04:36.300
you learn sequence models and how to apply

91
00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.080
them to natural language processing and other problems.

92
00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.600
So sequence models includes models like

93
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.465
recurrent neural networks abbreviated RNNs and LSTM models,

94
00:04:47.465 --> 00:04:49.645
stands for a long short term memory models.

95
00:04:49.645 --> 00:04:52.740
You'll learn what these terms mean in course five and be able to

96
00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.865
apply them to natural language processing problems.

97
00:04:56.865 --> 00:05:02.220
So you learn these models in course five and be able to apply them to sequence data.

98
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.670
So for example, natural language is just a sequence of words,

99
00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:10.504
and you also understand how these models can be applied to speech recognition,

100
00:05:10.504 --> 00:05:14.140
or to music generation, and other problems.

101
00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:15.735
So through these courses,

102
00:05:15.735 --> 00:05:17.705
you'll learn the tools of deep learning,

103
00:05:17.705 --> 00:05:20.100
you'll be able to apply them to build amazing things,

104
00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:24.810
and I hope many of you through this will also be able to advance your career.

105
00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:26.910
So that, let's get started.

106
00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.145
Please go on to the next video where we'll talk about

107
00:05:29.145 --> 00:05:31.000
deep learning applied to supervise learning.
