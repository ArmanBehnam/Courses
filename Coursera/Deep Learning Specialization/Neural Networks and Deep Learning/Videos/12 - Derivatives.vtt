00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.530
In this video, I want to help you gain an intuitive understanding,

2
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.065
of calculus and the derivatives.

3
00:00:07.065 --> 00:00:11.820
Now, maybe you're thinking that you haven't seen calculus since your college days,

4
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.515
and depending on when you graduated,

5
00:00:13.515 --> 00:00:15.885
maybe that was quite some time back.

6
00:00:15.885 --> 00:00:18.930
Now, if that's what you're thinking, don't worry,

7
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.350
you don't need a deep understanding of calculus in order

8
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.070
to apply new networks and deep learning very effectively.

9
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.940
So, if you're watching this video or some of the later videos and you're wondering,

10
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.500
well, is this stuff really for me,

11
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.510
this calculus looks really complicated.

12
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.880
My advice to you is the following, which is that,

13
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.270
watch the videos and then if you could do

14
00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.299
the homeworks and complete the programming homeworks successfully,

15
00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:43.325
then you can apply deep learning.

16
00:00:43.325 --> 00:00:46.115
In fact, when you see later is that in week four,

17
00:00:46.115 --> 00:00:49.400
we'll define a couple of types of functions that will enable you to

18
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.030
encapsulate everything that needs to be done with respect to calculus,

19
00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.750
that these functions called forward functions and backward functions that you learn about.

20
00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.239
That lets you put everything you need to know about calculus into these functions,

21
00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:04.055
so that you don't need to worry about them anymore beyond that.

22
00:01:04.055 --> 00:01:08.210
But I thought that in this foray into deep learning that this week,

23
00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.980
we should open up the box and peer a little bit further into the details of calculus.

24
00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.070
But really, all you need is an intuitive understanding of this

25
00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.535
in order to build and successfully apply these algorithms.

26
00:01:19.535 --> 00:01:25.570
Finally, if you are among that maybe smaller group of people that are expert in calculus,

27
00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.950
if you are very familiar with calculus derivatives,

28
00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.410
it's probably okay for you to skip this video.

29
00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.450
But for everyone else, let's dive in,

30
00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.710
and try to gain an intuitive understanding of derivatives.

31
00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.500
I plotted here the function f(a) equals 3a.

32
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.195
So, it's just a straight line.

33
00:01:41.195 --> 00:01:43.380
To get intuition about derivatives,

34
00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.230
let's look at a few points on this function.

35
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.090
Let say that a is equal to two.

36
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.990
In that case, f of a,

37
00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.850
which is equal to three times a is equal to six.

38
00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.225
So, if a is equal to two,

39
00:01:55.225 --> 00:01:58.055
then f of a will be equal to six.

40
00:01:58.055 --> 00:02:01.550
Let's say we give the value of a just a little bit of a nudge.

41
00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.660
I'm going to just bump up a,

42
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.750
a little bit, so that it is now 2.001.

43
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.485
So, I'm going to give a like a tiny little nudge, to the right.

44
00:02:10.485 --> 00:02:13.770
So now, let's say 2.001,

45
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.375
just plot this into scale,

46
00:02:15.375 --> 00:02:20.910
2.001, this 0.001 difference is too small to show on this plot,

47
00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.380
just give a little nudge to that right.

48
00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:23.790
Now, f(a),

49
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.800
is equal to three times that.

50
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.960
So, it's 6.003, so we plot this over here.

51
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.340
This is not to scale, this is 6.003.

52
00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.890
So, if you look at this little triangle here that I'm highlighting in green,

53
00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.640
what we see is that if I nudge a 0.001 to the right,

54
00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.540
then f of a goes up by 0.003.

55
00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:48.980
The amounts that f of a,

56
00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.215
went up is three times as big as the amount that I nudge the a to the right.

57
00:02:54.215 --> 00:02:56.135
So, we're going to say that,

58
00:02:56.135 --> 00:03:01.755
the slope or the derivative of the function f of a,

59
00:03:01.755 --> 00:03:06.735
at a equals to or when a is equals two to the slope is three.

60
00:03:06.735 --> 00:03:09.170
The term derivative basically means slope,

61
00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.075
it's just that derivative sounds like a scary and more

62
00:03:12.075 --> 00:03:16.910
intimidating word, whereas a slope is a friendlier way to describe the concept of derivative.

63
00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.320
So, whenever you hear derivative,

64
00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.450
just think slope of the function.

65
00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.605
More formally, the slope is defined as the height

66
00:03:24.605 --> 00:03:29.330
divided by the width of this little triangle that we have in green.

67
00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:34.005
So, this is 0.003 over 0.001,

68
00:03:34.005 --> 00:03:37.760
and the fact that the slope is equal to three or the derivative is equal to three,

69
00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:43.550
just represents the fact that when you nudge a to the right by 0.001, by tiny amount,

70
00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:49.665
the amount at f of a goes up is three times as big as the amount that you nudged it,

71
00:03:49.665 --> 00:03:52.265
that you nudged a in the horizontal direction.

72
00:03:52.265 --> 00:03:54.290
So, that's all that the slope of a line is.

73
00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.035
Now, let's look at this function at a different point.

74
00:03:57.035 --> 00:03:59.990
Let's say that a is now equal to five.

75
00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:01.430
In that case, f of a,

76
00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.380
three times a is equal to 15.

77
00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:04.625
So, let's see that again,

78
00:04:04.625 --> 00:04:06.245
give a, a nudge to the right.

79
00:04:06.245 --> 00:04:09.425
A tiny little nudge, it's now bumped up to 5.001,

80
00:04:09.425 --> 00:04:11.420
f of a is three times that.

81
00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.935
So, f of a is equal to 15.003.

82
00:04:14.935 --> 00:04:18.570
So, once again, when I bump a to the right,

83
00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.090
nudg a to the right by 0.001,

84
00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.325
f of a goes up three times as much.

85
00:04:23.325 --> 00:04:28.260
So the slope, again, at a = 5, is also three.

86
00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:29.910
So, the way we write this,

87
00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.255
that the slope of the function f is equal to three:

88
00:04:33.255 --> 00:04:36.435
We say, d f(a)

89
00:04:36.435 --> 00:04:38.895
da and this just means,

90
00:04:38.895 --> 00:04:41.400
the slope of the function f(a)

91
00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.305
when you nudge the variable a,

92
00:04:43.305 --> 00:04:47.715
a tiny little amount, this is equal to three.

93
00:04:47.715 --> 00:04:52.250
An alternative way to write this derivative formula is as follows.

94
00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.140
You can also write this as,

95
00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:57.965
d da of f(a).

96
00:04:57.965 --> 00:05:03.060
So, whether you put f(a) on top or whether you write it down here, it doesn't matter.

97
00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.100
But all this equation means is that,

98
00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:08.145
if I nudge a to the right a little bit,

99
00:05:08.145 --> 00:05:14.465
I expect f(a) to go up by three times as much as I nudged the value of little a.

100
00:05:14.465 --> 00:05:18.615
Now, for this video I explained derivatives,

101
00:05:18.615 --> 00:05:25.430
talking about what happens if we nudged the variable a by 0.001.

102
00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.000
If you want a formal mathematical definition of the derivatives:

103
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.320
Derivatives are defined with an even smaller value of how much you nudge a to the right.

104
00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:35.955
So, it's not 0.001.

105
00:05:35.955 --> 00:05:38.235
It's not 0.000001.

106
00:05:38.235 --> 00:05:42.315
It's not 0.00000000 and so on 1.

107
00:05:42.315 --> 00:05:44.250
It's even smaller than that,

108
00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:47.015
and the formal definition of derivative says,

109
00:05:47.015 --> 00:05:50.840
whenever you nudge a to the right by an infinitesimal amount,

110
00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.900
basically an infinitely tiny, tiny amount.

111
00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:58.970
If you do that, this f(a) go up three times as much as whatever was the tiny,

112
00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:01.160
tiny, tiny amount that you nudged a to the right.

113
00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.640
So, that's actually the formal definition of a derivative.

114
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.490
But for the purposes of our intuitive understanding,

115
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:12.695
which I'll talk about nudging a to the right by this small amount 0.001.

116
00:06:12.695 --> 00:06:18.130
Even if it's 0.001 isn't exactly tiny, tiny infinitesimal.

117
00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:21.590
Now, one property of the derivative is that,

118
00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:24.480
no matter where you take the slope of this function,

119
00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:25.730
it is equal to three,

120
00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:28.820
whether a is equal to two or a is equal to five.

121
00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.655
The slope of this function is equal to three,

122
00:06:31.655 --> 00:06:34.365
meaning that whatever is the value of a,

123
00:06:34.365 --> 00:06:36.915
if you increase it by 0.001,

124
00:06:36.915 --> 00:06:40.305
the value of f of a goes up by three times as much.

125
00:06:40.305 --> 00:06:42.635
So, this function has a safe slope everywhere.

126
00:06:42.635 --> 00:06:44.150
One way to see that is that,

127
00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:47.090
wherever you draw this little triangle.

128
00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:49.690
The height, divided by the width,

129
00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:52.460
always has a ratio of three to one.

130
00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:55.250
So, I hope this gives you a sense of what the slope or

131
00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:58.100
the derivative of a function means for a straight line,

132
00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:02.075
where in this example the slope of the function was three everywhere.

133
00:07:02.075 --> 00:07:06.110
In the next video, let's take a look at a slightly more complex example,

134
00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:10.200
where the slope to the function can be different at different points on the function.
