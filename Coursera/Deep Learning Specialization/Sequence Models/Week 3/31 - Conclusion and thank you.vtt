00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Congratulations on making it this far.

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.005
I just want to wrap up and leave you with a few final thoughts.

3
00:00:07.005 --> 00:00:10.230
We've been on quite a journey together,

4
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.065
but if you've taken the whole specialization,

5
00:00:13.065 --> 00:00:16.365
then you've learned about neural networks and deep learning,

6
00:00:16.365 --> 00:00:18.555
how to improve deep neural networks,

7
00:00:18.555 --> 00:00:20.970
how to structure machine learning projects,

8
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.115
convolutional neural networks, and then in this most recent course, sequence models.

9
00:00:26.115 --> 00:00:28.440
I know you've worked really hard,

10
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.420
and I also hope you feel very proud of

11
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.960
yourself for your hard work and for how much you've done.

12
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.950
So, I want to leave you one maybe important thoughts,

13
00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.375
which is that, I think deep learning is a superpower.

14
00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:44.279
With deep learning algorithms,

15
00:00:44.279 --> 00:00:46.400
you can make a computer see,

16
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.580
you can have a computer synthesize novel art or synthesize music.

17
00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.435
You can have a computer translate from one language to another.

18
00:00:55.435 --> 00:00:58.990
Maybe have it locally radiology image and render

19
00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:05.830
a medical diagnosis or build pieces of a car that can drive itself,

20
00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.675
and if that isn't a superpower,

21
00:01:07.675 --> 00:01:09.980
I don't know what it is.

22
00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.410
As we wrap up this sequence of courses,

23
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.855
as we wrap up this specialization,

24
00:01:15.855 --> 00:01:22.055
I hope that you will find ways to use these ideas to further your career,

25
00:01:22.055 --> 00:01:23.670
to pursue your dream,

26
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.650
but perhaps most important,

27
00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.320
to do whatever you think is the best of what you can do of humanity.

28
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.890
The world today has challenges,

29
00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.130
but with the power of AI and power of deep learning,

30
00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.235
I think we can make it a much better place.

31
00:01:40.235 --> 00:01:42.365
Now that you have this superpower,

32
00:01:42.365 --> 00:01:45.860
I hope you will use it to go out there and make

33
00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.270
life better for yourself but also for other people.

34
00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.280
Of course, I also hope you feel very proud of your accomplishments,

35
00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.070
and of how far you've come,

36
00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.115
and of all that you've learned.

37
00:01:59.115 --> 00:02:02.600
When you complete this sequence of courses,

38
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.100
you should also share it on

39
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.150
social media like Twitter or Facebook and let your friends know.

40
00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:11.480
Finally, the very last thing I want to say to you

41
00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.015
is congratulations on finishing the course.

42
00:02:14.015 --> 00:02:16.505
I hope you feel great about your accomplishments,

43
00:02:16.505 --> 00:02:19.280
but also want to thank you very much.

44
00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.830
I know that you have a busy life but despite that,

45
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.750
spends a lot of time watching these videos and maybe spend a lot of time

46
00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.010
also working on the quizzes and the programming exercises.

47
00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.220
I hope you enjoyed it and you've got a lot of the process,

48
00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.600
but I'm also very grateful for all your time you spent

49
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.220
and for all your hard work you put into learning these materials.

50
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.300
So, thank you very much.
