Welcome to this fifth course on deep learning.

2
00:00:02.805 --> 00:00:05.481
In this course, you learn about sequence models,

3
00:00:05.481 --> 00:00:07.800
one of the most exciting areas in deep learning.

4
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:13.088
Models like recurrent neural networks or RNNs have transformed speech recognition,

5
00:00:13.088 --> 00:00:15.620
natural language processing and other areas.

6
00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.930
And in this course, you learn how to build these models for yourself.

7
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.590
Let's start by looking at a few examples of where sequence models can be useful.

8
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.470
In speech recognition you are given

9
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.310
an input audio clip X and asked to map it to a text transcript Y.

10
00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.560
Both the input and the output here are sequence data,

11
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.393
because X is an audio clip and so that plays out over time and Y,

12
00:00:38.393 --> 00:00:41.295
the output, is a sequence of words.

13
00:00:41.295 --> 00:00:45.049
So sequence models such as a recurrent neural networks and other variations,

14
00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:48.953
you'll learn about in a little bit have been very useful for speech recognition.

15
00:00:48.953 --> 00:00:53.880
Music generation is another example of a problem with sequence data.

16
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.300
In this case, only the output Y is a sequence,

17
00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.510
the input can be the empty set,

18
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.617
or it can be a single integer,

19
00:01:02.617 --> 00:01:04.770
maybe referring to the genre of music you want to

20
00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:07.978
generate or maybe the first few notes of the piece of music you want.

21
00:01:07.978 --> 00:01:15.120
But here X can be nothing or maybe just an integer and output Y is a sequence.

22
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.165
In sentiment classification the input X is a sequence,

23
00:01:19.165 --> 00:01:20.788
so given the input phrase like,

24
00:01:20.788 --> 00:01:26.469
"There is nothing to like in this movie" how many stars do you think this review will be?

25
00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:31.140
Sequence models are also very useful for DNA sequence analysis.

26
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.385
So your DNA is represented via the four alphabets A, C, G,

27
00:01:35.385 --> 00:01:39.515
and T. And so given a DNA sequence can you label

28
00:01:39.515 --> 00:01:43.996
which part of this DNA sequence say corresponds to a protein.

29
00:01:43.996 --> 00:01:47.250
In machine translation you are given an input sentence,

30
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.549
voulez-vou chante avec moi?

31
00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:53.160
And you're asked to output the translation in a different language.

32
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.400
In video activity recognition you might be given

33
00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.073
a sequence of video frames and asked to recognize the activity.

34
00:02:01.073 --> 00:02:04.380
And in name entity recognition you might be given

35
00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.840
a sentence and asked to identify the people in that sentence.

36
00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:16.155
So all of these problems can be addressed as supervised learning with label data X,

37
00:02:16.155 --> 00:02:18.085
Y as the training set.

38
00:02:18.085 --> 00:02:20.010
But, as you can tell from this list of examples,

39
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.765
there are a lot of different types of sequence problems.

40
00:02:22.765 --> 00:02:26.745
In some, both the input X and the output Y are sequences,

41
00:02:26.745 --> 00:02:28.470
and in that case,

42
00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.750
sometimes X and Y can have different lengths,

43
00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.109
or in this example and this example,

44
00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:35.455
X and Y have the same length.

45
00:02:35.455 --> 00:02:41.000
And in some of these examples only either X or only the opposite Y is a sequence.

46
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.261
So in this course you learn about sequence models are applicable,

47
00:02:44.261 --> 00:02:46.560
so all of these different settings.

48
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.800
So I hope this gives you a sense of the exciting set of

49
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.815
problems that sequence models might be able to help you to address.

50
00:02:53.815 --> 00:02:56.610
With that let us go on to the next video where we start to define

51
00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.680
the notation we use to define these sequence problems.
