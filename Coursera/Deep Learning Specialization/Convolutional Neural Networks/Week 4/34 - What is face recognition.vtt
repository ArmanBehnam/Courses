00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.490
Hi, and welcome to this fourth and final week

2
00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:06.374
of this course on convolutional neural networks.

3
00:00:06.374 --> 00:00:08.930
By now, you've learned a lot about confidence.

4
00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:11.590
What I want to do this week is show you

5
00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.481
a couple important special applications of confidence.

6
00:00:15.481 --> 00:00:17.286
We'll start the face recognition,

7
00:00:17.286 --> 00:00:21.135
and then go on later this week to neurosal transfer,

8
00:00:21.135 --> 00:00:26.015
which you get to implement in the problem exercise as well to create your own artwork.

9
00:00:26.015 --> 00:00:30.095
But first, let's start the face recognition and just for fun,

10
00:00:30.095 --> 00:00:31.395
I want to show you a demo.

11
00:00:31.395 --> 00:00:33.730
When I was leading by those AI group,

12
00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.120
one of the teams I worked with led by Yuanqing Lin had built

13
00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.405
a face recognition system that I thought is really cool. Let's take a look.

14
00:00:41.405 --> 00:00:43.360
So, I'm going to play this video here,

15
00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.690
but I can also get whoever is editing this raw video configure out to this

16
00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:55.630
better to splice in the raw video or take the one I'm playing here.

17
00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.110
I want to show you a face recognition demo.

18
00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.975
I'm in Baidu's headquarters in China.

19
00:00:58.975 --> 00:01:01.740
Most companies require that to get inside,

20
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.799
you swipe an ID card like this one but here we don't need that.

21
00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.355
Using face recognition, check what I can do.

22
00:01:07.355 --> 00:01:09.580
When I walk up, it recognizes my face, it says,

23
00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:15.030
"Welcome Andrew," and I just walk right through without ever having to use my ID card.

24
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.530
Let me show you something else.

25
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.730
I'm actually here with Lin Yuanqing,

26
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:22.530
the director of IDL which developed all of this face recognition technology.

27
00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.530
I'm gonna hand him my ID card,

28
00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.230
which has my face printed on it,

29
00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.820
and he's going to use it to try to sneak in using my picture instead of a live human.

30
00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:37.698
I'm gonna use Andrew's card and try to sneak in and see what happens.

31
00:01:37.698 --> 00:01:43.400
So the system is not recognizing it,

32
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.271
it refuses to recognize.

33
00:01:47.271 --> 00:01:53.280
Okay. Now, I'm going to use my own face.

34
00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:59.000
So face recognition technology like this is taking off very rapidly in China

35
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.710
and I hope that this type of technology soon makes it way to other countries..

36
00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.075
So, pretty cool, right?

37
00:02:07.075 --> 00:02:12.323
The video you just saw demoed both face recognition as well as liveness detection.

38
00:02:12.323 --> 00:02:16.010
The latter meaning making sure that you are a live human.

39
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.240
It turns out liveness detection can be implemented using supervised learning as well

40
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:25.201
to predict live human versus not live human but I want to spend less time on that.

41
00:02:25.201 --> 00:02:28.160
Instead, I want to focus our time on talking about how to

42
00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.365
build the face recognition portion of the system.

43
00:02:31.365 --> 00:02:36.071
First, let's start by going over some of the terminology used in face recognition.

44
00:02:36.071 --> 00:02:38.200
In the face recognition literature,

45
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.605
people often talk about face verification and face recognition.

46
00:02:42.605 --> 00:02:45.845
This is the face verification problem which is if you're

47
00:02:45.845 --> 00:02:49.835
given an input image as well as a name or ID

48
00:02:49.835 --> 00:02:53.300
of a person and the job of the system is to

49
00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.080
verify whether or not the input image is that of the claimed person.

50
00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.170
So, sometimes this is also called a one to

51
00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.435
one problem where you just want to know if the person is the person they claim to be.

52
00:03:04.435 --> 00:03:09.485
So, the recognition problem is much harder than the verification problem.

53
00:03:09.485 --> 00:03:11.090
To see why, let's say,

54
00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.140
you have a verification system that's 99 percent accurate.

55
00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.040
So, 99 percent might not be too bad but now suppose

56
00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.606
that K is equal to 100 in a recognition system.

57
00:03:23.606 --> 00:03:30.290
If you apply this system to a recognition task with a 100 people in your database,

58
00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.710
you now have a hundred times of chance of making

59
00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:38.030
a mistake and if the chance of making mistakes on each person is just one percent.

60
00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.860
So, if you have a database of

61
00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:45.530
a 100 persons and if you want an acceptable recognition error,

62
00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.755
you might actually need a verification system with maybe

63
00:03:48.755 --> 00:03:52.520
99.9 or even higher accuracy before you can run

64
00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.430
it on a database of 100 persons that have

65
00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.840
a high chance and still have a high chance of getting incorrect.

66
00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.440
In fact, if you have a database of 100 persons currently just be even

67
00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.330
quite a bit higher than 99 percent for that to work well.

68
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:11.645
But what we do in the next few videos is focus on building

69
00:04:11.645 --> 00:04:17.720
a face verification system as a building block and then if the accuracy is high enough,

70
00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.984
then you probably use that in a recognition system as well.

71
00:04:21.984 --> 00:04:23.150
So in the next video,

72
00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.395
we'll start describing how you can build a face verification system.

73
00:04:27.395 --> 00:04:29.630
It turns out one of the reasons that is

74
00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:34.125
a difficult problem is you need to solve a one shot learning problem.

75
00:04:34.125 --> 00:04:37.000
Let's see in the next video what that means.
