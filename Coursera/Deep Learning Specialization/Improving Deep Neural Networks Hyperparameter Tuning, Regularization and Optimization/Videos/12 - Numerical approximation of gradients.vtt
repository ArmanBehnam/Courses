00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:04.720
When you implement back propagation
you'll find that there's a test called

2
00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.700
creating checking that can
really help you make sure

3
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.710
that your implementation
of back prop is correct.

4
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.376
Because sometimes you write all these
equations and you're just not 100% sure if

5
00:00:14.376 --> 00:00:17.940
you've got all the details right and
internal back propagation.

6
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.020
So in order to build up to gradient and
checking,

7
00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.490
let's first talk about how to numerically
approximate computations of gradients and

8
00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.400
in the next video,
we'll talk about how you can implement

9
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.028
gradient checking to make sure
the implementation of backdrop is correct.

10
00:00:32.028 --> 00:00:37.310
So lets take the function f and
replot it here and remember this is

11
00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:43.110
f of theta equals theta cubed, and let's
again start off to some value of theta.

12
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.640
Let's say theta equals 1.

13
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.180
Now instead of just nudging theta to
the right to get theta plus epsilon,

14
00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.460
we're going to nudge it to the right and

15
00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.110
nudge it to the left to get theta minus
epsilon, as was theta plus epsilon.

16
00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.935
So this is 1, this is 1.01,
this is 0.99 where, again,

17
00:01:02.935 --> 00:01:06.144
epsilon is same as before, it is 0.01.

18
00:01:06.144 --> 00:01:10.378
It turns out that rather than
taking this little triangle and

19
00:01:10.378 --> 00:01:15.526
computing the height over the width,
you can get a much better estimate of

20
00:01:15.526 --> 00:01:20.922
the gradient if you take this point,
f of theta minus epsilon and this point,

21
00:01:20.922 --> 00:01:26.230
and you instead compute the height
over width of this bigger triangle.

22
00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:31.988
So for technical reasons which I won't go
into, the height over width of this bigger

23
00:01:31.988 --> 00:01:37.601
green triangle gives you a much better
approximation to the derivative at theta.

24
00:01:37.601 --> 00:01:41.338
And you saw it yourself, taking just
this lower triangle in the upper right

25
00:01:41.338 --> 00:01:43.372
is as if you have two triangles, right?

26
00:01:43.372 --> 00:01:47.220
This one on the upper right and
this one on the lower left.

27
00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.760
And you're kind of taking
both of them into account

28
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.450
by using this bigger green triangle.

29
00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.720
So rather than a one sided difference,
you're taking a two sided difference.

30
00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:58.954
So let's work out the math.

31
00:01:58.954 --> 00:02:03.648
This point here is F
of theta plus epsilon.

32
00:02:03.648 --> 00:02:07.870
This point here is F of
theta minus epsilon.

33
00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:12.390
So the height of this big green
triangle is f of theta plus epsilon

34
00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.230
minus f of theta minus epsilon.

35
00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:21.250
And then the width,
this is 1 epsilon, this is 2 epsilon.

36
00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.390
So the width of this green
triangle is 2 epsilon.

37
00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.400
So the height of the width is
going to be first the height, so

38
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:35.110
that's F of theta plus epsilon minus F of
theta minus epsilon divided by the width.

39
00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.920
So that was 2 epsilon which
we write that down here.

40
00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.450
And this should hopefully
be close to g of theta.

41
00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.350
So plug in the values,
remember f of theta is theta cubed.

42
00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.890
So this is theta plus epsilon is 1.01.

43
00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:58.250
So I take a cube of that minus 0.99 theta
cube of that divided by 2 times 0.01.

44
00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.580
Feel free to pause the video and
practice in the calculator.

45
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.259
You should get that this is 3.0001.

46
00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:10.581
Whereas from the previous slide,
we saw that g of theta,

47
00:03:10.581 --> 00:03:14.272
this was 3 theta squared so
when theta was 1, so

48
00:03:14.272 --> 00:03:18.519
these two values are actually
very close to each other.

49
00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:22.250
The approximation error is now 0.0001.

50
00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.456
Whereas on the previous slide,
we've taken the one sided

51
00:03:27.456 --> 00:03:34.150
of difference just theta + theta +
epsilon we had gotten 3.0301 and

52
00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:40.340
so the approximation error
was 0.03 rather than 0.0001.

53
00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.260
So this two sided difference way of

54
00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.462
approximating the derivative you find
that this is extremely close to 3.

55
00:03:48.462 --> 00:03:53.320
And so this gives you a much greater
confidence that g of theta is

56
00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.890
probably a correct implementation
of the derivative of F.

57
00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.480
When you use this method for grading,
checking and back propagation,

58
00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.230
this turns out to run twice as slow as
you were to use a one-sided defense.

59
00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.193
It turns out that in practice I think it's
worth it to use this other method because

60
00:04:10.193 --> 00:04:11.752
it's just much more accurate.

61
00:04:11.752 --> 00:04:13.946
The little bit of optional theory for

62
00:04:13.946 --> 00:04:18.685
those of you that are a little bit more
familiar of Calculus, it turns out that,

63
00:04:18.685 --> 00:04:22.249
and it's okay if you don't get
what I'm about to say here.

64
00:04:22.249 --> 00:04:26.772
But it turns out that the formal
definition of a derivative is for

65
00:04:26.772 --> 00:04:31.629
very small values of epsilon is f of
theta plus epsilon minus f of theta

66
00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:33.917
minus epsilon over 2 epsilon.

67
00:04:33.917 --> 00:04:38.852
And the formal definition of
derivative is in the limits of exactly

68
00:04:38.852 --> 00:04:42.480
that formula on the right
as epsilon those as 0.

69
00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.270
And the definition of unlimited is
something that you learned if you

70
00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.980
took a Calculus class but
I won't go into that here.

71
00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.398
And it turns out that for
a non zero value of epsilon,

72
00:04:52.398 --> 00:04:56.517
you can show that the error of
this approximation is on the order

73
00:04:56.517 --> 00:05:00.889
of epsilon squared, and
remember epsilon is a very small number.

74
00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:08.471
So if epsilon is 0.01 which it is
here then epsilon squared is 0.0001.

75
00:05:08.471 --> 00:05:12.098
The big O notation means the error is
actually some constant times this, but

76
00:05:12.098 --> 00:05:15.240
this is actually exactly
our approximation error.

77
00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.478
So the big O constant happens to be 1.

78
00:05:17.478 --> 00:05:22.182
Whereas in contrast if we were to
use this formula, the other one,

79
00:05:22.182 --> 00:05:25.129
then the error is on the order of epsilon.

80
00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:29.872
And again, when epsilon is a number
less than 1, then epsilon is actually

81
00:05:29.872 --> 00:05:34.618
much bigger than epsilon squared which
is why this formula here is actually

82
00:05:34.618 --> 00:05:38.790
much less accurate approximation
than this formula on the left.

83
00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:43.690
Which is why when doing gradient checking,
we rather use this two-sided difference

84
00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:48.113
when you compute f of theta plus epsilon
minus f of theta minus epsilon and then

85
00:05:48.113 --> 00:05:52.900
divide by 2 epsilon rather than just one
sided difference which is less accurate.

86
00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:57.090
If you didn't understand my last two
comments, all of these things are on here.

87
00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:58.480
Don't worry about it.

88
00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:02.460
That's really more for those of you that
are a bit more familiar with Calculus, and

89
00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.630
with numerical approximations.

90
00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:08.890
But the takeaway is that this two-sided
difference formula is much more accurate.

91
00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:12.445
And so that's what we're going to use when
we do gradient checking in the next video.

92
00:06:13.725 --> 00:06:16.355
So you've seen how by taking
a two sided difference,

93
00:06:16.355 --> 00:06:20.845
you can numerically verify whether or
not a function g, g of theta that someone

94
00:06:20.845 --> 00:06:25.675
else gives you is a correct implementation
of the derivative of a function f.

95
00:06:25.675 --> 00:06:28.265
Let's now see how we can use
this to verify whether or

96
00:06:28.265 --> 00:06:31.435
not your back propagation
implementation is correct or

97
00:06:31.435 --> 00:06:34.855
if there might be a bug in there
that you need to go and tease out
