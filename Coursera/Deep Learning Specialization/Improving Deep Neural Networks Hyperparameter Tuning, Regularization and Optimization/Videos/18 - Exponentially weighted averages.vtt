00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760
I want to show you a few optimization algorithms.

2
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.795
They are faster than gradient descent.

3
00:00:04.795 --> 00:00:06.807
In order to understand those algorithms,

4
00:00:06.807 --> 00:00:11.850
you need to be able they use something called exponentially weighted averages.

5
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.840
Also called exponentially weighted moving averages in statistics.

6
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.030
Let's first talk about that,

7
00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:21.420
and then we'll use this to build up to more sophisticated optimization algorithms.

8
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.820
So, even though I now live in the United States,

9
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.463
I was born in London.

10
00:00:25.463 --> 00:00:31.120
So, for this example I got the daily temperature from London from last year.

11
00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.511
So, on January 1,

12
00:00:32.511 --> 00:00:35.175
temperature was 40 degrees Fahrenheit.

13
00:00:35.175 --> 00:00:37.795
Now, I know most of the world uses a Celsius system,

14
00:00:37.795 --> 00:00:41.065
but I guess I live in United States which uses Fahrenheit.

15
00:00:41.065 --> 00:00:43.550
So that's four degrees Celsius.

16
00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.150
And on January 2,

17
00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.630
it was nine degrees Celsius and so on.

18
00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:50.250
And then about halfway through the year,

19
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.373
a year has 365 days so, that would be,

20
00:00:52.373 --> 00:00:56.530
sometime day number 180 will be sometime in late May, I guess.

21
00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.795
It was 60 degrees Fahrenheit which is 15 degrees Celsius, and so on.

22
00:01:00.795 --> 00:01:05.575
So, it start to get warmer, towards summer and it was colder in January.

23
00:01:05.575 --> 00:01:08.435
So, you plot the data you end up with this.

24
00:01:08.435 --> 00:01:12.290
Where day one being sometime in January, that you know,

25
00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:13.775
being the, beginning of summer,

26
00:01:13.775 --> 00:01:15.070
and that's the end of the year,

27
00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.380
kind of late December.

28
00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.194
So, this would be January, January 1,

29
00:01:20.194 --> 00:01:21.885
is the middle of the year approaching summer,

30
00:01:21.885 --> 00:01:24.710
and this would be the data from the end of the year.

31
00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.885
So, this data looks a little bit noisy and if you want to compute the trends,

32
00:01:29.885 --> 00:01:35.547
the local average or a moving average of the temperature,

33
00:01:35.547 --> 00:01:37.885
here's what you can do.

34
00:01:37.885 --> 00:01:41.530
Let's initialize V zero equals zero.

35
00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.640
And then, on every day,

36
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.340
we're going to average it with a weight of 0.9 times whatever appears as value,

37
00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.600
plus 0.1 times that day temperature.

38
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.155
So, theta one here would be the temperature from the first day.

39
00:01:57.155 --> 00:02:01.180
And on the second day, we're again going to take a weighted average.

40
00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:08.210
0.9 times the previous value plus 0.1 times today's temperature and so on.

41
00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.930
Day two plus 0.1 times theta three and so on.

42
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:20.470
And the more general formula is V on a given day is 0.9 times V from the previous day,

43
00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.460
plus 0.1 times the temperature of that day.

44
00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.035
So, if you compute this and plot it in red,

45
00:02:28.035 --> 00:02:29.527
this is what you get.

46
00:02:29.527 --> 00:02:32.660
You get a moving average of what's called an

47
00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.510
exponentially weighted average of the daily temperature.

48
00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.560
So, let's look at the equation we had from the previous slide,

49
00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.225
it was VT equals,

50
00:02:42.225 --> 00:02:44.210
previously we had 0.9.

51
00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.790
We'll now turn that to prime to beta,

52
00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.190
beta times VT minus one plus and it previously,

53
00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:56.715
was 0.1, I'm going to turn that into one minus beta times theta T,

54
00:02:56.715 --> 00:03:00.175
so, previously you had beta equals 0.9.

55
00:03:00.175 --> 00:03:03.230
It turns out that for reasons we are going to later,

56
00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:13.860
when you compute this you can think of VT as approximately averaging over,

57
00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:21.400
something like one over one minus beta, day's temperature.

58
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.895
So, for example when beta goes 0.9 you could think of

59
00:03:26.895 --> 00:03:32.430
this as averaging over the last 10 days temperature.

60
00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.050
And that was the red line.

61
00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:37.215
Now, let's try something else.

62
00:03:37.215 --> 00:03:39.200
Let's set beta to be very close to one,

63
00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.660
let's say it's 0.98.

64
00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.640
Then, if you look at 1/1 minus 0.98,

65
00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.040
this is equal to 50.

66
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.340
So, this is, you know, think of this as averaging over roughly,

67
00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.085
the last 50 days temperature.

68
00:03:54.085 --> 00:03:58.360
And if you plot that you get this green line.

69
00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.870
So, notice a couple of things with this very high value of beta.

70
00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.565
The plot you get is much smoother because you're now

71
00:04:04.565 --> 00:04:07.635
averaging over more days of temperature.

72
00:04:07.635 --> 00:04:08.795
So, the curve is just, you know,

73
00:04:08.795 --> 00:04:10.800
less wavy is now smoother,

74
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.300
but on the flip side the curve has now shifted further to

75
00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.840
the right because you're now averaging over a much larger window of temperatures.

76
00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.030
And by averaging over a larger window,

77
00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.275
this formula, this exponentially weighted average formula.

78
00:04:24.275 --> 00:04:25.850
It adapts more slowly,

79
00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.920
when the temperature changes.

80
00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.755
So, there's just a bit more latency.

81
00:04:29.755 --> 00:04:33.860
And the reason for that is when Beta 0.98 then it's

82
00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.240
giving a lot of weight to the previous value and a much smaller weight just 0.02,

83
00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.700
to whatever you're seeing right now.

84
00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.080
So, when the temperature changes,

85
00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.560
when temperature goes up or down,

86
00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.845
there's exponentially weighted average.

87
00:04:45.845 --> 00:04:48.990
Just adapts more slowly when beta is so large.

88
00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.160
Now, let's try another value.

89
00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.045
If you set beta to another extreme,

90
00:04:53.045 --> 00:04:54.980
let's say it is 0.5,

91
00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:58.755
then this by the formula we have on the right.

92
00:04:58.755 --> 00:05:03.690
This is something like averaging over just two days temperature,

93
00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.420
and you plot that you get this yellow line.

94
00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:09.290
And by averaging only over two days temperature,

95
00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:12.240
you have a much, as if you're averaging over much shorter window.

96
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.415
So, you're much more noisy,

97
00:05:13.415 --> 00:05:15.515
much more susceptible to outliers.

98
00:05:15.515 --> 00:05:19.490
But this adapts much more quickly to what the temperature changes.

99
00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:24.390
So, this formula is highly implemented, exponentially weighted average.

100
00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:26.090
Again, it's called an exponentially weighted,

101
00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:28.760
moving average in the statistics literature.

102
00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:32.210
We're going to call it exponentially weighted average for short and

103
00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:36.000
by varying this parameter or later we'll see

104
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.350
such a hyper parameter if you're learning algorithm you can get

105
00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:41.315
slightly different effects and there will usually be

106
00:05:41.315 --> 00:05:44.075
some value in between that works best.

107
00:05:44.075 --> 00:05:46.893
That gives you the red curve which you know maybe looks like

108
00:05:46.893 --> 00:05:50.450
a beta average of the temperature than either the green or the yellow curve.

109
00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:54.160
You now know the basics of how to compute exponentially weighted averages.

110
00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.010
In the next video, let's get a bit more intuition about what it's doing.
