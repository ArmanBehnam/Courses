Hi, welcome to this course on how to structure your machine learning project,

2
00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.740
that is on machine learning strategy.

3
00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.490
I hope that through this course you will learn how to much more

4
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.235
quickly and efficiently get your machine learning systems working.

5
00:00:15.235 --> 00:00:17.915
So, what is machine learning strategy.

6
00:00:17.915 --> 00:00:20.640
Let's start with a motivating example.

7
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.755
Let's say you are working on your cat cost file.

8
00:00:23.755 --> 00:00:26.060
And after working it for some time,

9
00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.013
you've gotten your system to have 90% accuracy,

10
00:00:29.013 --> 00:00:31.985
but this isn't good enough for your application.

11
00:00:31.985 --> 00:00:34.980
You might then have a lot of ideas as to how to improve your system.

12
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.060
For example, you might think well let's collect more data, more training data.

13
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:40.315
Or you might say,

14
00:00:40.315 --> 00:00:42.880
maybe your training set isn't diverse enough yet,

15
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.050
you should collect images of cats in more diverse poses,

16
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.335
or maybe a more diverse set of negative examples.

17
00:00:49.335 --> 00:00:52.552
Well maybe you want to train the algorithm longer with gradient descent.

18
00:00:52.552 --> 00:00:54.923
Or maybe you want to try a different optimization algorithm,

19
00:00:54.923 --> 00:00:57.455
like the Adam optimization algorithm.

20
00:00:57.455 --> 00:01:01.230
Or maybe trying a bigger network or a smaller network or maybe you want

21
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.160
to try to dropout or maybe L2 regularization.

22
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.360
Or maybe you want to change

23
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.660
the network architecture such as changing activation functions,

24
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.420
changing the number of hidden units and so on and so on.

25
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.040
When trying to improve a deep learning system,

26
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.238
you often have a lot of ideas or things you could try.

27
00:01:19.238 --> 00:01:21.680
And the problem is that if you choose poorly,

28
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.080
it is entirely possible that you end up spending six months charging in

29
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.785
some direction only to realize after six months that that didn't do any good.

30
00:01:29.785 --> 00:01:33.810
For example, I've seen some teams spend literally six months collecting

31
00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.120
more data only to realize after

32
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.260
six months that it barely improved the performance of their system.

33
00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.355
So, assuming you don't have six months to waste on your problem,

34
00:01:43.355 --> 00:01:46.290
won't it be nice if you had quick and effective ways to

35
00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.070
figure out which of all of these ideas and maybe even other ideas,

36
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.365
are worth pursuing and which ones you can safely discard.

37
00:01:54.365 --> 00:01:59.190
So what I hope to do in this course is teach you a number of strategies, that is,

38
00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.365
ways of analyzing a machine learning problem that will

39
00:02:02.365 --> 00:02:06.570
point you in the direction of the most promising things to try.

40
00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.267
What I will do in this course also is share with

41
00:02:08.267 --> 00:02:09.930
you a number of lessons I've learned through

42
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:13.700
building and shipping large number of deep learning products.

43
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.755
And I think these materials are actually quite unique to this course.

44
00:02:17.755 --> 00:02:20.280
I don't see a lot of these ideas being taught

45
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.970
in universities' deep learning courses for example.

46
00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.880
It turns out also that machine learning strategy is

47
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.850
changing in the era of deep learning because the things you could

48
00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.745
do are now different with deep learning algorithms

49
00:02:32.745 --> 00:02:36.255
than with previous generation of machine learning algorithms.

50
00:02:36.255 --> 00:02:39.330
I hope that these ideas will help you become much more

51
00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.390
effective at getting your deep learning systems to work.
