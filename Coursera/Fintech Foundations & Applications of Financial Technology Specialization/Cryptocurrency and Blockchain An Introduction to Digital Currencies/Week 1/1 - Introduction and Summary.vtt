00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.290
Hello, I'm Professor
Jessica Wachter.

2
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.150
First, I'm going to describe

3
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.330
the goal of the
next three modules.

4
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.790
So the subject of Cryptocurrency

5
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.130
has attracted
considerable attention.

6
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.980
Now, some of
this attention has been

7
00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.530
positive focusing on
the potential for

8
00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:21.934
cryptocurrency to disrupt
existing monopolies

9
00:00:21.934 --> 00:00:23.449
and give power to consumers

10
00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:25.615
but some has been
highly negative.

11
00:00:25.615 --> 00:00:30.740
Cryptocurrency has been referred
to as a fraud or worse.

12
00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.830
So there have been wild
and misleading claims

13
00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:37.325
both on the positive and
on the negative side.

14
00:00:37.325 --> 00:00:40.430
Nonetheless,
more than 11 years after

15
00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.730
the distribution of Satoshi
Nakamoto's famous whitepaper,

16
00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.110
some things are clear.

17
00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.240
The first is
that cryptocurrency and

18
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.400
the associate technology
of blockchain and

19
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.685
distributed consensus
has staying power and

20
00:00:53.685 --> 00:00:56.765
cryptocurrency is
inherently a hard subject

21
00:00:56.765 --> 00:00:59.660
as it combines knowledge
from computer science,

22
00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.235
cryptography, finance,

23
00:01:01.235 --> 00:01:05.630
economics, even probability,
law, and philosophy.

24
00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.560
So in other words, the barrier to

25
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.520
entry to cryptocurrency
is understanding.

26
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.590
So this set of modules is

27
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.720
intended to serve
as an introduction.

28
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.744
The references I will provide

29
00:01:16.744 --> 00:01:18.560
can serve as a guide
if you decide

30
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.660
further investment
in understanding

31
00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.655
cryptocurrency is right for you.

32
00:01:23.655 --> 00:01:26.270
Now, these lectures are
designed for a listener with

33
00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.195
a background in finance which
is where I'm coming from.

34
00:01:29.195 --> 00:01:31.670
No background in
computer science is necessary,

35
00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:32.930
though some of the concepts in

36
00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.535
the second module
may be challenging.

37
00:01:35.535 --> 00:01:37.580
But the most important
requirement is

38
00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.740
a strong interest in the subject.

39
00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.050
So here's a summary
of the modules.

40
00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.605
The first module is about
the basics of cryptocurrency.

41
00:01:45.605 --> 00:01:46.820
What is it and what are

42
00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.965
the problems it is
designed to solve?

43
00:01:48.965 --> 00:01:50.930
The second module covers

44
00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.560
blockchain and distributed
consensus protocols.

45
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.750
How do these relate
to cryptocurrencies?

46
00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.045
What are they and
how are they used?

47
00:01:59.045 --> 00:02:01.070
Finally, in the third module,

48
00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.350
I will describe cryptocurrency
as an asset class.
