00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:05.190
So what is cryptocurrency?

2
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.770
There are differing opinions.

3
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.840
So Jamie Dimon of JP Morgan says,

4
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.718
cryptocurrency is a fraud,
worse than tulip bulbs.

5
00:00:15.718 --> 00:00:23.930
Warren Buffet says, cryptocurrency
is probably rat poison squared.

6
00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.093
And he goes on to say,

7
00:00:25.093 --> 00:00:28.717
if I could buy a five year put on
every one of the cryptocurrencies,

8
00:00:28.717 --> 00:00:33.070
I'd be glad to do it, but
I would never short a dime's worth.

9
00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.760
Interesting, so what is cryptocurrency?

10
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.994
So, the title of
Nouriel Roubini's congressional

11
00:00:40.994 --> 00:00:43.794
testimony answers the question as follows.

12
00:00:43.794 --> 00:00:48.617
Crypto is the mother of all scams and
now busted bubbles,

13
00:00:48.617 --> 00:00:53.745
while Blockchain is the most
over-hyped technology ever,

14
00:00:53.745 --> 00:00:57.375
no better than a spreadsheet/database.

15
00:00:57.375 --> 00:01:01.088
Or is cryptocurrency the future of money?

16
00:01:01.088 --> 00:01:08.180
As a FinTech-crazed fellow finance
Professor once said to me,

17
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.140
will our grandchildren or
great grandchildren be asking us,

18
00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.200
what were you doing when
money was being created?

19
00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.700
So let's consider bitcoin.

20
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.083
Probably the biggest myth about
bitcoin is that it's an actual coin.

21
00:01:26.083 --> 00:01:27.160
Well, it's not.

22
00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.010
It's not an actual coin.

23
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.720
It's a unit of exchange.

24
00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:40.830
At the moment, bitcoins are trading
at $3,772.38 per one bitcoin.

25
00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:46.270
But fortunately,
it's not necessary to buy a whole bitcoin.

26
00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:52.150
The smallest unit to trade
bitcoins is one satoshi or

27
00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.015
one hundred millionth of a bitcoin.

28
00:01:56.015 --> 00:01:58.360
Here's the outline of this lecture.

29
00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.010
First, I will discuss
transacting in bitcoin.

30
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.800
So if we want to understand
why bitcoin might be popular,

31
00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.970
we need to ask what exactly is currency?

32
00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.200
Bitcoin is a cash-alternative to currency,
so

33
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.510
we're going to talk about
cash-alternatives currently in use.

34
00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.932
Given that we have some pretty
good cash-alternatives, and

35
00:02:20.932 --> 00:02:25.196
new ones all the time,
we can ask why then cryptocurrency?

36
00:02:25.196 --> 00:02:27.806
And then finally, concluding thoughts.
