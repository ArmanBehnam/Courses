1
00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.425
Why then Cryptocurrency?

2
00:00:04.425 --> 00:00:06.720
So perhaps we can start to see

3
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.705
the appeal of Bitcoin and
other cryptocurrency.

4
00:00:09.705 --> 00:00:13.320
So what Bitcoin
allows one to do is

5
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.490
to perform online transactions
and for that matter,

6
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.130
offline transactions
that do not require

7
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.540
physical cash because that's

8
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.685
very difficult to
deal with online.

9
00:00:23.685 --> 00:00:26.040
So potentially any
transaction for which

10
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.170
a credit card is used or

11
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.255
debit card or PayPal could
be a Bitcoin transaction.

12
00:00:33.255 --> 00:00:37.395
But it accomplishes this
while being decentralized.

13
00:00:37.395 --> 00:00:39.840
So there is no centralized
intermediary.

14
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.225
There is no centralized ledger.

15
00:00:42.225 --> 00:00:44.345
But why would we want

16
00:00:44.345 --> 00:00:48.170
an alternative to credit cards
or other intermediaries?

17
00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.750
So let's go through
some possible reasons.

18
00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.130
So reason one a

19
00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.530
centralized intermediary
has a lot of power.

20
00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.750
For instance, it can charge fees.

21
00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.270
Should we worry about
the potential for

22
00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.660
abuse given the near-monopoly
power for intermediary?

23
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.320
For example, perhaps
the credit card company

24
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.990
might be tempted to tamper
with its centralized ledger.

25
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.740
Might it say remove

26
00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.330
some funds for enemies
or reward friends.?

27
00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.870
So that's certainly
a possibility,

28
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.800
but probably this
would not happen.

29
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.810
Any credit card company or

30
00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.120
a bank that was caught
doing something like

31
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.570
this would not last
very long and it is

32
00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.365
very profitable to be
a centralized intermediary.

33
00:01:33.365 --> 00:01:35.150
Centralized
intermediaries have what

34
00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:36.650
is known as franchise value.

35
00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.900
It's because of these fees
that they can charge.

36
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.450
So part of what we don't like

37
00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.450
about centralized intermediaries
namely their high fees,

38
00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.940
which for credit card companies
take the form of

39
00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.970
the fees charged to
the merchants and for

40
00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.665
banks take the form of

41
00:01:51.665 --> 00:01:54.990
those annoying low deposit rates

42
00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.730
that get paid to customers.

43
00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.855
Well, we might not like those,

44
00:01:58.855 --> 00:02:01.460
they make it very
profitable to be

45
00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:02.640
a centralized intermediary and

46
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.170
they create franchise value,

47
00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.355
and once a company has
franchise value it has

48
00:02:07.355 --> 00:02:09.980
a built-in incentive to behave in

49
00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:13.650
a trustworthy fashion
because it would be very,

50
00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:19.610
very stupid to lose this high
amazing franchise value.

51
00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.200
So the current system
is in a sense ensures

52
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.690
its own safety by

53
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.640
allowing intermediaries to have

54
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.170
this high franchise value.

55
00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.090
So I don't think reason one is

56
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.370
really a good reason
for Cryptocurrency.

57
00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.535
So let's explore
some other reasons.

58
00:02:36.535 --> 00:02:38.625
Reason two is you do not like

59
00:02:38.625 --> 00:02:42.065
centralized intermediaries
for philosophical reasons.

60
00:02:42.065 --> 00:02:45.560
Perhaps you are an extreme
libertarian or an anarchist.

61
00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.420
So this describes some people,

62
00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.210
but it's probably not universal.

63
00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:51.530
So if we're looking for,

64
00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.815
why Bitcoin might have
say, widespread adoption?

65
00:02:54.815 --> 00:02:57.585
Reason two is not
very good either.

66
00:02:57.585 --> 00:02:58.995
Reason three.

67
00:02:58.995 --> 00:03:00.290
So reason three is,

68
00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.510
you don't want to use
the centralized intermediary

69
00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:03.590
because you do not want

70
00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.270
anybody to know
what you're up to.

71
00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.555
The centralized intermediary
keeps records.

72
00:03:08.555 --> 00:03:10.850
Those records could be accessed

73
00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.370
by the government under
certain conditions.

74
00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.400
Perhaps you do not trust
the government for some reason,

75
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.480
maybe you are doing something

76
00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.310
specifically against the law,

77
00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.380
perhaps trading with someone
you're not supposed to be

78
00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.930
trading with
according to the law,

79
00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.940
perhaps trading in
substances that shouldn't

80
00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.190
be traded in
according to the law.

81
00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:29.840
So whatever one thinks about

82
00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.895
this from a moral standpoint,

83
00:03:31.895 --> 00:03:35.075
it actually is a pretty
good reason to use Bitcoin.

84
00:03:35.075 --> 00:03:36.960
To summarize,

85
00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.465
where does this leave
us in terms of Bitcoin?

86
00:03:39.465 --> 00:03:42.350
So for Bitcoin, there
are what we could

87
00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.920
call multiple equilibria
in terms of its value.

88
00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.900
So one equilibrium for

89
00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.930
Bitcoin and the one that
our commentators at

90
00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.120
the beginning seemed
to think is going to

91
00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.110
persist is that no one uses it.

92
00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:57.590
If this is the case,

93
00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.410
then actually it's true
worth really is zero.

94
00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.345
This is possible for a currency,

95
00:04:02.345 --> 00:04:03.830
but not safe for stocks.

96
00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:07.645
A currency that nobody uses
has no intrinsic worth.

97
00:04:07.645 --> 00:04:12.335
Now, a potential other
equilibrium is that it is used by

98
00:04:12.335 --> 00:04:15.230
a narrow group of people
and this is what seems to

99
00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.700
prevail more or
less at the moment.

100
00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:23.120
Now, the future of
money argument suggests

101
00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.120
that perhaps it will

102
00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.580
become a dominant medium
of exchange.

103
00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.320
Now what's interesting
is that there's

104
00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.120
really little middle ground
between two and three.

105
00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.280
No matter how much we may
think Bitcoin is cool and

106
00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.120
exciting we really
won't want to bother

107
00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.330
with a currency that
so few people use.

108
00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.250
So whereas some people might have

109
00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:48.320
specific reasons to use
Bitcoin it won't be

110
00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.960
dominantly used unless
a critical mass

111
00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.285
of people have a reason
to use Bitcoin.

112
00:04:53.285 --> 00:04:55.760
Now we went through
some reasons just

113
00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.780
now about why Bitcoin
could replace

114
00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:05.000
the current centralized
intermediaries that allow us to

115
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.850
transact without actually
using dollars but

116
00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:12.210
none of those reasons were
really that convincing.

117
00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.785
Does this mean we should conclude

118
00:05:15.785 --> 00:05:19.475
that Bitcoin will forever
be a niche product?

119
00:05:19.475 --> 00:05:22.820
Well, some people
clearly think so,

120
00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:26.525
but it's not really so clear.

121
00:05:26.525 --> 00:05:29.510
Because there's another reason
that people might

122
00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:32.779
want to use cryptocurrency
and that is,

123
00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:34.070
cryptocurrency really is

124
00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:36.875
a currency alternative
to dollars.

125
00:05:36.875 --> 00:05:38.360
Now at the moment,

126
00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.370
that's somewhat of
a disadvantage because

127
00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:43.265
the value of Bitcoin
is very volatile.

128
00:05:43.265 --> 00:05:45.050
But that's at the moment.

129
00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:46.880
So what if dollar themselves were

130
00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.465
to somehow become untrustworthy?

131
00:05:49.465 --> 00:05:52.270
Well, we're far away
from that at the moment,

132
00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:54.590
but the value of the dollar does

133
00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:56.945
rest in the hands of
the Federal Reserve.

134
00:05:56.945 --> 00:05:59.630
The Federal Reserve is in
principle independent,

135
00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:01.370
it should be but

136
00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.380
the president of
the United States is also

137
00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.240
the commander in chief

138
00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.815
who for that matter,
controls the army.

139
00:06:08.815 --> 00:06:12.200
Even if everything
is working well,

140
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:13.460
the value of the dollar

141
00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:15.560
depends on everyone's
expectations.

142
00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:20.435
It is not entirely in the hands
of the Federal Reserve.

143
00:06:20.435 --> 00:06:23.150
So what could go

144
00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:26.030
wrong that would make

145
00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:29.015
cryptocurrency an
appealing alternative?

146
00:06:29.015 --> 00:06:30.730
Well, two things.

147
00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:34.790
Currently, we are in
a very low inflation regime,

148
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:37.030
but that might change.

149
00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:39.310
What if we had some level say,

150
00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:41.485
let's say five percent inflation?

151
00:06:41.485 --> 00:06:45.425
So five percent inflation
doesn't sound so bad,

152
00:06:45.425 --> 00:06:47.795
but it is in effect

153
00:06:47.795 --> 00:06:52.115
a tax on everybody who
has to use the currency.

154
00:06:52.115 --> 00:06:54.950
So because of the fiat,

155
00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:58.655
namely because
investors have to hold

156
00:06:58.655 --> 00:07:03.440
dollars to pay off debts
and to pay off taxes,

157
00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.665
you have to hold some dollars,

158
00:07:05.665 --> 00:07:07.650
but if the sovereign,

159
00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:09.640
the US government in this case,

160
00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:14.240
freely elected decides
to allow for inflation,

161
00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:18.215
those dollars that you
hold will erode in value.

162
00:07:18.215 --> 00:07:20.540
So in effect, it's
like a tax because

163
00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:21.890
the government gets to spend

164
00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:23.720
the new dollars
that it's printing,

165
00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:26.660
but your dollars that
you hold are worth

166
00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:28.610
less and because of

167
00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:31.040
the fiat you really do
have to hold the dollars.

168
00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:32.330
So in that sense,

169
00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:34.535
having a competitor to dollars

170
00:07:34.535 --> 00:07:37.820
means that perhaps
for the first time

171
00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:40.430
in history residents
of a country are

172
00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:42.000
not trapped by the seigniorage

173
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.390
this is what this is called.

174
00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:46.640
Now, of course, there's
a scarier alternative which

175
00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:48.410
is the currency truly

176
00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:50.870
becoming unstable and
there are, of course,

177
00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:52.340
famous examples of this like

178
00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:54.800
the Weimar Republic from 1921 to

179
00:07:54.800 --> 00:08:00.020
1923 and Venezuela
starting in 2016.

180
00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:02.510
So Bitcoin is specifically

181
00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:05.135
designed with protection
against these.

182
00:08:05.135 --> 00:08:08.840
So these events, especially
the second, are remote,

183
00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:11.450
but it's their possibility that

184
00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:15.530
fuels interests in
Bitcoin at least in part.

185
00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:17.965
So to summarize,

186
00:08:17.965 --> 00:08:20.570
from the point of view of
the end user Bitcoin is

187
00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:23.720
a currency like any other
because Bitcoin is not

188
00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:25.430
recognized as legal tender by

189
00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:27.230
any sovereign at the moment,

190
00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:29.570
zero is always a possible answer
to the question,

191
00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:30.910
what is its value?

192
00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:32.840
So ultimately its value will

193
00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:34.700
depend on whether
it can be used as

194
00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:38.390
a medium of exchange or in fact,

195
00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:40.700
whether people believe it
can be used as a medium of

196
00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:43.340
exchange or actually
whether people believe,

197
00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:44.750
that people believe
it can be used as

198
00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:46.895
a medium of exchange and so on.

199
00:08:46.895 --> 00:08:48.500
So you can see that actually,

200
00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:52.045
beliefs play a role
here and so even if

201
00:08:52.045 --> 00:08:54.080
Bitcoin does not
have a major role as

202
00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:56.240
a medium of exchange
if some people think,

203
00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:57.380
that some people
think it could be

204
00:08:57.380 --> 00:08:59.090
used in the future as a medium of

205
00:08:59.090 --> 00:09:03.020
exchange that is a reason
for it to have a value.

206
00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:05.930
Now, why would it be appealing
as a medium of exchange?

207
00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:08.330
Well, the ease of
transactions without relying

208
00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:10.880
on a centralized intermediary and

209
00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:13.160
it's a currency that's not
prone to manipulation or

210
00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:16.160
instability due to
a central bank.

211
00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:18.890
So the key question is
will Bitcoin remain

212
00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:22.370
a niche product or might
it be widely adopted?

213
00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:26.000
It is not enough for Bitcoin
to have some advantages.

214
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.700
There must be a critical
mass of users who

215
00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:32.350
see these advantages
as important.
