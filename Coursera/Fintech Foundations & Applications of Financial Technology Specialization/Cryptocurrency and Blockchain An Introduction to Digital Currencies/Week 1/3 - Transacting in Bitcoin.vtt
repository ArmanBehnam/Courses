00:00:01.678 --> 00:00:06.407
So first of all transacting in
Bitcoin at this present time it's

2
00:00:06.407 --> 00:00:08.090
actually quite easy.

3
00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.558
So ironically even though
Bitcoin is not an actual coin,

4
00:00:12.558 --> 00:00:18.049
what you need is a wallet and
your wallet can even be a physical wallet,

5
00:00:18.049 --> 00:00:20.951
though that's probably not ideal.

6
00:00:20.951 --> 00:00:24.716
What your wallet is, it's a place
to store your Bitcoin credentials,

7
00:00:24.716 --> 00:00:27.030
which means your private key.

8
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.059
Now what exactly is a private key?

9
00:00:29.059 --> 00:00:33.482
It's a 256 bit number
expressed as a hexadecimal, so

10
00:00:33.482 --> 00:00:36.070
here on the slides is an example.

11
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.171
Now this key is generated
using cryptography.

12
00:00:41.171 --> 00:00:45.440
So if you lose your key
there's no way to get it back.

13
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.673
So when people say they've
lost their Bitcoin,

14
00:00:47.673 --> 00:00:49.751
it's their private key that they've lost.

15
00:00:49.751 --> 00:00:54.430
So there's simply no way without
the private key to access Bitcoin.

16
00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.663
On the other hand,
if someone somehow takes your private key,

17
00:00:57.663 --> 00:01:00.360
then they have your Bitcoin,
you have no recourse.

18
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.286
Using your private key you can generate
your unique address which is public,

19
00:01:05.286 --> 00:01:08.409
and this allows you to
sign off on transactions.

20
00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:13.776
So with all that as background current
third party software such as Coinbase for

21
00:01:13.776 --> 00:01:17.632
example, which can be simply
downloaded to your phone.

22
00:01:17.632 --> 00:01:22.417
It does all of this for you and
stores your private key within its created

23
00:01:22.417 --> 00:01:27.680
digital wallet and then also access is for
you a Bitcoin exchange.

24
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.783
You can separately however
choose a wallet and an exchange.

25
00:01:30.783 --> 00:01:34.854
And in the sphere of Bitcoin
the wallet can doesn't need

26
00:01:34.854 --> 00:01:38.550
to be a third party can be peer to peer.

27
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.367
Interestingly you can also buy
Bitcoin with cash using an ATM, and

28
00:01:43.367 --> 00:01:48.191
there are several even on
Lancaster Avenue here in Philadelphia.

29
00:01:48.191 --> 00:01:53.064
What the Bitcoin ATM will then give you is
a hard copy of your private key which you

30
00:01:53.064 --> 00:01:57.937
can then keep on an actual wallet, but
you should probably transfer to a digital

31
00:01:57.937 --> 00:02:00.869
wallet for security and
ease of transactions.

32
00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.374
Once you own Bitcoin,
you can purchase goods or

33
00:02:05.374 --> 00:02:08.184
services from other users using bitcoin or
merchants.

34
00:02:08.184 --> 00:02:13.530
There's no distinction in Bitcoin
between users and merchants.

35
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.537
You can trade Bitcoin back to dollars and
again to Bitcoin.

36
00:02:17.537 --> 00:02:20.704
You can trade it for
other cryptocurrencies, in other words,

37
00:02:20.704 --> 00:02:22.749
Bitcoin is a currency, like any other.

38
00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.068
However, while Bitcoin is a currency,
it is nothing but a currency.

39
00:02:29.068 --> 00:02:35.880
It is not like say a stock, which is
a claim to ownership in a company.

40
00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.849
Or a treasury bill, which you can think of
as a claim to the income of US taxpayers.

41
00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:47.060
Which is to say that as a currency it
has value as a medium of exchange.

42
00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.571
Now it doesn't need to have value as
a medium of exchange at the moment.

43
00:02:52.571 --> 00:02:57.237
But unless people believe that it can
eventually function as a medium of

44
00:02:57.237 --> 00:03:01.840
exchange in some states of the world,
Bitcoin has no inherent value.

45
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.720
So as we think about those opening quotes
the idea that Bitcoin is a fraud or

46
00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.018
rat poison in the school yard.

47
00:03:11.018 --> 00:03:17.550
There is some truth to that because one
possible value to Bitcoin is always zero.

48
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:25.319
However, might Bitcoin function someday
as a generalised medium of exchange.

49
00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:28.965
So some people clearly think this
is impossible, thus the fraud,

50
00:03:28.965 --> 00:03:30.480
thus the bubble.

51
00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.139
But to really answer this question,

52
00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:37.098
we need to consider what we
actually mean by currency.

53
00:03:37.098 --> 00:03:40.810
So here's the currency that we
normally think of, the US dollar.

54
00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.565
So the US dollar is fiat money,
it's not linked to say anything like gold.

55
00:03:45.565 --> 00:03:50.190
Now in the US the US dollar is legal
tender, now what exactly does that mean?

56
00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.465
Many people think that merchants
are required to take US dollars but

57
00:03:54.465 --> 00:03:55.667
that's not true.

58
00:03:55.667 --> 00:03:58.905
What it actually means is that the
Treasury is required to take dollars as

59
00:03:58.905 --> 00:04:00.490
payment for taxes.

60
00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:04.795
And if someone owes you money you
are required to take dollars as payment.

61
00:04:04.795 --> 00:04:10.180
So legal tender is short for legal
tender for all debts public and private.

62
00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.468
So the requirement to accept dollars for
private debt is by fiat.

63
00:04:14.468 --> 00:04:18.470
It is backed by the power of the sovereign
in this case, the US government.

64
00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.962
Now ultimately the authority of
the sovereign rests with the ability to

65
00:04:23.962 --> 00:04:28.510
enforce the law and all the enforcement
mechanisms we are familiar with,

66
00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.687
the courts, the police,
possibly even the army.

67
00:04:31.687 --> 00:04:35.122
So that's what's lying
behind this fiat money,

68
00:04:35.122 --> 00:04:40.150
the fact that it's payment for
debts, public and private.

69
00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.775
And that we can enforce the fact that it's
payment for debts, public and private.

70
00:04:44.775 --> 00:04:49.158
But of course, that's not the only use for
dollars, so the fiat of the US government

71
00:04:49.158 --> 00:04:52.890
does not extend to private businesses
accepting dollars for payment.

72
00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:58.146
And of course, it does not extend to all
of the transactions all over the world,

73
00:04:58.146 --> 00:05:01.926
both legal and illegal,
that take place using dollars.

74
00:05:01.926 --> 00:05:06.401
But these transactions do occur, and
apparently more frequently than ever,

75
00:05:06.401 --> 00:05:10.850
is that the demand for dollars as
paper currency is actually growing.

76
00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:13.548
So these transactions occur,
because we are in

77
00:05:13.548 --> 00:05:18.547
what the economists call a self-fulfilling
equilibrium when it comes to US currency.

78
00:05:18.547 --> 00:05:22.597
Everyone agrees to take US dollars
because they believe that everyone will

79
00:05:22.597 --> 00:05:25.190
take US dollars,
now what does this rest on?

80
00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:30.071
Well ultimately it rests on the fact that
dollars can pay taxes and discharge debt.

81
00:05:30.071 --> 00:05:33.951
And to the rule of law there's really
nothing else other than the beliefs of

82
00:05:33.951 --> 00:05:36.550
all individuals that
everyone will take dollar.

83
00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.384
So this is what we mean by
self-fulfilling equilibrium.

84
00:05:39.384 --> 00:05:43.156
So the bottom line is what
makes a currency a currency,

85
00:05:43.156 --> 00:05:48.569
namely a medium of exchange, are the
common beliefs of the individual users.

86
00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:54.095
Now that's dollars, but apparently
using physical dollars is sufficiently

87
00:05:54.095 --> 00:05:59.382
cumbersome that a profitable industry
has a reason to allow us to avoid it.

88
00:05:59.382 --> 00:06:03.746
For example, nearly all merchants
accept Visa and MasterCard,

89
00:06:03.746 --> 00:06:08.505
most merchants accept four major
credit cards, Visa, Master Cards,

90
00:06:08.505 --> 00:06:11.062
plus Discover and American Express.

91
00:06:11.062 --> 00:06:15.286
But these cards are very costly for
merchants, they need to pay a fee,

92
00:06:15.286 --> 00:06:17.871
that can be over 2% of the transactions.

93
00:06:17.871 --> 00:06:19.174
Interestingly enough,

94
00:06:19.174 --> 00:06:22.530
by law, merchants are not allowed
to offer discounts for cash.

95
00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:27.403
Which means these cards are very
profitable for the credit card companies,

96
00:06:27.403 --> 00:06:32.442
and they are nice for consumers because
consumers receive tax free benefits.

97
00:06:32.442 --> 00:06:35.620
Because customers demand
the use of these cards,

98
00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:41.006
merchants have to use them despite the
fees, otherwise they risk losing business.

99
00:06:41.006 --> 00:06:46.047
And the fact that they're not allowed to
price discriminate means that these card

100
00:06:46.047 --> 00:06:51.016
companies form an oligopoly that may be
under threat in various ways by fintech,

101
00:06:51.016 --> 00:06:53.372
that's discussed in other modules.

102
00:06:53.372 --> 00:06:57.782
But at the moment, the oligopoly still
seems to be pretty strong seeing as

103
00:06:57.782 --> 00:06:59.998
the fees have recently been raised.

104
00:06:59.998 --> 00:07:03.215
Now technically using these cards
implies that one is taking on debt,

105
00:07:03.215 --> 00:07:06.450
which is an alternative form of
payment other than currency.

106
00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:11.487
But in practice,
the distinction between debt and

107
00:07:11.487 --> 00:07:16.417
say a bank account is
perhaps not very important.

108
00:07:16.417 --> 00:07:21.183
Both credit card companies and your bank,
which you may access with a debit card or

109
00:07:21.183 --> 00:07:25.830
potentially with PayPal, are what's
known as centralized intermediaries.

110
00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:30.784
All the transactions are still
done in terms of dollars, but

111
00:07:30.784 --> 00:07:34.799
the credit card company or
the bank keeps track of the accounts and

112
00:07:34.799 --> 00:07:37.662
verifies the legitimacy
of the transaction.

113
00:07:37.662 --> 00:07:42.600
The intermediary in other words
maintains a centralized ledger.

114
00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:46.826
This is why stores take credit cards and
debit cards instead of money.

115
00:07:46.826 --> 00:07:51.768
They do not have to worry that they
will not receive their funds because

116
00:07:51.768 --> 00:07:56.640
the intermediary ensures that
the centralized ledger is accurate.

117
00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:02.355
So the credit cards are costly, yes,
but it does avoid what used to happen

118
00:08:02.355 --> 00:08:06.343
long time ago in which merchants
had to keep their own ledgers,

119
00:08:06.343 --> 00:08:10.506
and had to keep track of which
customers checks would not bounce.

120
00:08:10.506 --> 00:08:15.075
And of course a big applications is
that it allows anonymous transactions

121
00:08:15.075 --> 00:08:19.807
Internet transactions when you have
no idea who you're transacting with.

122
00:08:19.807 --> 00:08:23.807
So to briefly recap,
Bitcoin is a currency like any other,

123
00:08:23.807 --> 00:08:28.618
as a currency it can function as a medium
of exchange or a store of value.

124
00:08:28.618 --> 00:08:32.752
Now in the US we have a great
medium of exchange dollars.

125
00:08:32.752 --> 00:08:36.944
The functionality of dollars as a medium
of exchange is through common beliefs.

126
00:08:36.944 --> 00:08:42.322
And the profitable industry of centralized
intermediaries has grown up to facilitate

127
00:08:42.322 --> 00:08:47.856
dollar transactions without the direct use
of dollars, through a centralized ledger.

128
00:08:47.856 --> 00:08:53.126
So given this landscape,
where does cryptocurrency come in?
