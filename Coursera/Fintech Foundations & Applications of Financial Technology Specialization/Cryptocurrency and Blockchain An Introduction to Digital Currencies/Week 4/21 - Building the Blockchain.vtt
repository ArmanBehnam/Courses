1
00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:07.620
An understanding of
the blockchain ecosystem

2
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.820
begins with understanding
how it is built.

3
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.755
This begins with a discussion
of the blockchain stack.

4
00:00:16.755 --> 00:00:20.040
The blockchain stack
has projects with

5
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.075
multiple layers of what
are called protocols.

6
00:00:24.075 --> 00:00:29.235
The stack might begin with
what's called a base layer,

7
00:00:29.235 --> 00:00:32.530
followed by an
application protocol,

8
00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:35.225
and then another
application layer

9
00:00:35.225 --> 00:00:37.420
at the top of the stack.

10
00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.860
By replicating and storing

11
00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.594
user data across
a decentralized network

12
00:00:43.594 --> 00:00:47.285
rather than individual
applications controlling

13
00:00:47.285 --> 00:00:51.050
access to silos of information,

14
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.105
blockchain does
two very important things.

15
00:00:55.105 --> 00:00:58.520
First, it reduces barriers to

16
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.110
entry for those who are
utilizing its benefits.

17
00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.045
Secondly, it creates

18
00:01:05.045 --> 00:01:09.170
a potentially much more
competitive ecosystem

19
00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.550
of products and services.

20
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.420
Maybe you have heard
about Bitcoin mining.

21
00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.530
Bitcoin's process requires
the continuous validation of

22
00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.435
new transactions and recording
of them on the blockchain.

23
00:01:26.435 --> 00:01:31.345
This is the process that is
called mining the blocks.

24
00:01:31.345 --> 00:01:35.235
Each block contains a timestamp,

25
00:01:35.235 --> 00:01:37.990
what's known as a nonce,

26
00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.125
a reference to the previous
block and a list of

27
00:01:42.125 --> 00:01:44.420
all the transactions
that have taken

28
00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.420
place since the previous block.

29
00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.780
Currently, a new Bitcoin block is

30
00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.770
mined approximately
every 10 minutes,

31
00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.930
but it's important
to note that due to

32
00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.500
the rapid transformation
of this technology,

33
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.860
that timing will
definitely change.

34
00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.975
To produce blocks, blockchain
miners compete to solve

35
00:02:08.975 --> 00:02:12.560
difficult mathematical
problems based on

36
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.775
what's called a cryptographic
hash algorithm.

37
00:02:16.775 --> 00:02:21.155
This process is
called Proof of Work.

38
00:02:21.155 --> 00:02:24.150
Proof of work provides that

39
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.810
the blockchain miner spends time

40
00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.930
and resources to solve a problem.

41
00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.525
Once that block is solved,

42
00:02:32.525 --> 00:02:36.895
the transactions in it
are considered confirmed.

43
00:02:36.895 --> 00:02:39.764
This is blockchain mining,

44
00:02:39.764 --> 00:02:41.930
and there are
several companies in

45
00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.380
the blockchain space that
perform this function.

46
00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.740
Concerns have been
expressed about the speed

47
00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.285
of this mining process
in the blockchain.

48
00:02:52.285 --> 00:02:54.260
We're always looking for

49
00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.560
reduced time to
process transactions.

50
00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.340
To address these concerns
over the speed of mining,

51
00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.765
a process known as Proof of
Stake has been developed.

52
00:03:05.765 --> 00:03:08.030
Proof of stake serves as

53
00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.200
an alternative to
this proof of work process.

54
00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.770
Proof of stake is a process
whereby the amount

55
00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.040
held in a particular
cryptocurrency

56
00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.219
determines the amount
that can be mined

57
00:03:22.219 --> 00:03:26.000
by that holder of
the cryptocurrency.

58
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.189
For example, if an individual

59
00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:32.355
holds three percent
of a cryptocurrency,

60
00:03:32.355 --> 00:03:34.605
that individual can mine

61
00:03:34.605 --> 00:03:39.565
three percent of the blocks
in a proof of stake process.

62
00:03:39.565 --> 00:03:42.050
Proof of stake is premised on

63
00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:44.720
the assumption that
individuals with

64
00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.820
an economic stake in

65
00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.050
the cryptocurrency would not

66
00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.015
want to devalue their holdings,

67
00:03:51.015 --> 00:03:52.970
so they will always act in

68
00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.165
the best interests of
the blockchain network.

69
00:03:56.165 --> 00:03:59.105
In understanding
the blockchain ecosystem

70
00:03:59.105 --> 00:04:00.490
and its development,

71
00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.675
it's very important to understand

72
00:04:02.675 --> 00:04:06.680
a concept known as
interoperability.

73
00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.390
Interoperability refers to
standards that ensure that

74
00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:14.510
different blockchain
implementations can

75
00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.325
work with each other,

76
00:04:16.325 --> 00:04:19.115
and there are many
blockchain companies

77
00:04:19.115 --> 00:04:21.475
working in this space.

78
00:04:21.475 --> 00:04:26.705
Currently, the only way to
move value across block chains

79
00:04:26.705 --> 00:04:32.150
is to move tokens into
a centralized token exchange,

80
00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.045
trade on the exchange's
in-house records,

81
00:04:36.045 --> 00:04:41.345
and then withdraw the asset
onto a different blockchain.

82
00:04:41.345 --> 00:04:45.260
Interoperability standards
could potentially speed up

83
00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.435
this process and derive
the creation of value.

84
00:04:49.435 --> 00:04:50.770
Fundamentally,

85
00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:55.115
there are two types of
blockchain interoperability.

86
00:04:55.115 --> 00:05:00.070
The first is known as
cross chain messaging,

87
00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:03.200
this process relays
messages about

88
00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.305
the state of one blockchain
to another blockchain.

89
00:05:07.305 --> 00:05:12.700
The second is known as
cross chain atomic swaps,

90
00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:17.719
this process facilitates
the exchange of tokens between

91
00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:23.510
users and across blockchains
without using a third party.

92
00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:27.680
Companies are working to
build bridges between

93
00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:32.810
blockchains and offer
interoperability between them.

94
00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:35.030
There are many other efforts

95
00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:36.860
underway in the development of

96
00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:38.690
blockchain that are working

97
00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:41.795
together to increase
its effectiveness.

98
00:05:41.795 --> 00:05:46.069
For example, scalability efforts
led by blockchain

99
00:05:46.069 --> 00:05:49.190
companies are underway to
increase the number of

100
00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:53.515
transactions that can be
processed in a period of time.

101
00:05:53.515 --> 00:05:56.090
Forks or changes in

102
00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:59.405
the procedures and
processes of a blockchain,

103
00:05:59.405 --> 00:06:02.420
and improvements
to the efficiency

104
00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:04.460
of how blockchains work.

105
00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.730
These efforts combined
together comprise

106
00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:09.230
an important part of

107
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:12.860
the development of
the blockchain ecosystem.

108
00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:16.460
In examining
the blockchain ecosystem

109
00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.380
and its development,

110
00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.870
there are two very
important things

111
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:23.180
that we should also talk about.

112
00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:26.345
Smart contracts and oracles.

113
00:06:26.345 --> 00:06:28.990
Maybe you've heard
of a smart contract,

114
00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:31.655
a smart contract is actually

115
00:06:31.655 --> 00:06:34.879
a set of digital
promises including

116
00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:37.625
protocols within
which the parties

117
00:06:37.625 --> 00:06:40.925
perform on the promises
of the contract.

118
00:06:40.925 --> 00:06:44.120
In other words,
a smart contract is

119
00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:48.530
a computer algorithm which
performs the contract.

120
00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:51.830
Smart contracts can
be written to be

121
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:56.780
executed both on and
off of a blockchain.

122
00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:01.790
An oracle is an agent
that finds and verifies

123
00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:04.880
real-world occurrences
and submits

124
00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:07.475
the information to a blockchain

125
00:07:07.475 --> 00:07:10.045
to be used by the
smart contracts.

126
00:07:10.045 --> 00:07:13.610
Essentially, an oracle
is a data feed

127
00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:17.900
provided by a third party
data service.

128
00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:20.500
There are many types of oracles;

129
00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:26.020
software oracles, hardware,
inbound data, outbound,

130
00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:30.200
and consensus-based where
multiple parties would have to

131
00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:34.930
agree in order to verify
a real-world occurrence.

132
00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:39.515
Together, smart contracts
and oracles comprise

133
00:07:39.515 --> 00:07:43.940
an exciting and dynamic part
of the blockchain ecosystem,

134
00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:49.085
because working together
they can help propel

135
00:07:49.085 --> 00:07:51.170
other parts of the development of

136
00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:53.360
the blockchain ecosystem and

137
00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:56.820
businesses that operate using it.

138
00:07:56.820 --> 00:08:00.320
Several other types
of companies are very

139
00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:04.610
important to the development
of the blockchain ecosystem.

140
00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:08.030
Among them are
blockchain security,

141
00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:11.595
legal and audit, and privacy.

142
00:08:11.595 --> 00:08:14.375
Blockchain security.

143
00:08:14.375 --> 00:08:17.420
It's important to
understand the elements

144
00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:20.495
that make blockchain tamperproof.

145
00:08:20.495 --> 00:08:22.825
We discussed them earlier.

146
00:08:22.825 --> 00:08:26.735
First, the cryptographic
fingerprint

147
00:08:26.735 --> 00:08:31.060
that's unique to each block
known as the hash,

148
00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:34.340
which proves that
the blockchain minor did

149
00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:39.145
the computational work to
add the block to the chain.

150
00:08:39.145 --> 00:08:43.985
A second element also makes
the blockchain tamperproof.

151
00:08:43.985 --> 00:08:48.350
A consensus protocol,
which is the process by

152
00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:50.240
which the parts of the network

153
00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:53.135
agree on the shared history.

154
00:08:53.135 --> 00:08:55.310
Because of this process,

155
00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:57.920
in order to change an entry in

156
00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:00.935
the distributed ledger
retroactively,

157
00:09:00.935 --> 00:09:04.640
a new hash would have to
be created not only for

158
00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:06.870
the block that it's currently in

159
00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:09.685
but for every subsequent block.

160
00:09:09.685 --> 00:09:11.090
There are companies in

161
00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:15.335
the blockchain ecosystem that
help ensure this process.

162
00:09:15.335 --> 00:09:18.470
Blockchain security companies.

163
00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:21.170
Blockchain security
companies conduct

164
00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:25.730
security audits of
decentralized applications.

165
00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:27.950
For example, they might review

166
00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:30.800
a systems architecture
and code and

167
00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:32.870
then provide a report on

168
00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:36.695
action items for the issues
that are discovered.

169
00:09:36.695 --> 00:09:39.860
Blockchain legal
and audit companies

170
00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:43.415
also comprise an important part
of its development.

171
00:09:43.415 --> 00:09:45.920
They audit the compliance of

172
00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:48.800
a company's use of
the blockchain.

173
00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:52.445
Privacy is also
an important consideration

174
00:09:52.445 --> 00:09:54.785
in the development
of the blockchain.

175
00:09:54.785 --> 00:09:58.130
Brockchain privacy companies
are distributed

176
00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:02.060
data privacy platforms.
How do they work?

177
00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:04.670
If an individual stores data on

178
00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:08.780
the blockchain encrypted
with their own public key,

179
00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:11.600
they can actually
delegate access to

180
00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:15.680
another individual using
a privacy company.

181
00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:18.900
That data is then rekeyed to

182
00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:22.915
the second individual's
