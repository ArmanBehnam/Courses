1
00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:07.890
If one were to picture
the blockchain ecosystem,

2
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.440
the next layer surrounding

3
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.710
its development would
be crypto finance.

4
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.820
Crypto finance is
a dynamic and developing area

5
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.980
of the blockchain ecosystem that

6
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.205
touches all aspects
of the businesses

7
00:00:23.205 --> 00:00:27.195
that operate within an
around the blockchain.

8
00:00:27.195 --> 00:00:30.480
Crypto finance includes payments,

9
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.295
privacy, wallets, exchanges,

10
00:00:35.295 --> 00:00:39.535
and other components
known as stable coins,

11
00:00:39.535 --> 00:00:41.654
different types of storage,

12
00:00:41.654 --> 00:00:43.370
and merchants that use

13
00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.670
the cryptocurrency to
operate their businesses.

14
00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.530
Cryptocurrency payments are

15
00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.425
an important part
of crypto finance.

16
00:00:51.425 --> 00:00:54.380
Recall that the blockchain allows

17
00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.040
us to store and transfer value.

18
00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.640
Cryptocurrency payments
allow us to manage

19
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.395
the ownership and transfer
of cryptocurrencies.

20
00:01:06.395 --> 00:01:11.044
These payments companies that
work in the crypto space,

21
00:01:11.044 --> 00:01:17.240
effectuate real-time, non-cash
payments between entities.

22
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.960
Blockchain technology is
particularly attractive

23
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.635
for this process because
it is decentralized,

24
00:01:24.635 --> 00:01:28.025
and unlike other payments systems

25
00:01:28.025 --> 00:01:32.720
avoids what's known as
a single point of failure.

26
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.305
Cryptocurrency payments
eliminate the role

27
00:01:36.305 --> 00:01:39.575
of third parties and delays.

28
00:01:39.575 --> 00:01:42.350
Cryptocurrency
privacy companies are

29
00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.310
another important part
of crypto finance.

30
00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.975
These privacy companies
create privacy by

31
00:01:50.975 --> 00:01:55.595
obscuring the identity of
the sender of a payment.

32
00:01:55.595 --> 00:01:59.720
They use what are known
as ring signatures or

33
00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.090
digital signatures that can be

34
00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.420
performed by
any member of a group.

35
00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.930
As a result, the transactions on

36
00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.585
cryptocurrency cannot be linked

37
00:02:11.585 --> 00:02:14.540
to specific real identity.

38
00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.100
When most people think of

39
00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.349
money they think of their wallet,

40
00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:20.660
which they use to keep it safe.

41
00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.480
There are wallets in the
cryptocurrency world as well,

42
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.795
but they're very different.

43
00:02:26.795 --> 00:02:28.995
Within crypto finance,

44
00:02:28.995 --> 00:02:32.975
a cryptocurrency wallet
serves an important function.

45
00:02:32.975 --> 00:02:37.720
A soft wallet is
one of these items.

46
00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.854
A soft wallet is
actually a pseudonym,

47
00:02:40.854 --> 00:02:44.510
meaning nothing is in
a physical wallet.

48
00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.750
It is in fact
a software program that

49
00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.095
stores the public and
private keys.

50
00:02:51.095 --> 00:02:55.310
A soft wallet interacts with
the blockchain to enable

51
00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.885
the holder to send and
receive digital currency.

52
00:02:59.885 --> 00:03:02.210
A soft wallet can support

53
00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:06.380
a single currency or
multiple currencies.

54
00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:12.050
Another important part of
crypto finance is the exchange.

55
00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:17.180
Cryptocurrency exchanges are
online trading platforms.

56
00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.470
They facilitate the exchange
of a cryptocurrency for

57
00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:26.120
fiat currency or a government
backed currency.

58
00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.110
Similar to a traditional
stock exchange where buyers

59
00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.905
and sellers trade based on
the current market place,

60
00:03:33.905 --> 00:03:38.255
cryptocurrency exchanges
perform the same function.

61
00:03:38.255 --> 00:03:40.610
It's important to remember that

62
00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.080
the security of a cryptocurrency
exchange is vital.

63
00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.030
In addition, the liquidity
of the exchange is crucial.

64
00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:51.830
The more transactions are

65
00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.875
performed on
an exchange, the better.

66
00:03:54.875 --> 00:03:57.800
Another important dynamic within

67
00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.050
the cryptocurrency finance world
is stable coins.

68
00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.065
A stable coin is a cryptocurrency

69
00:04:05.065 --> 00:04:08.195
with price stable
characteristics.

70
00:04:08.195 --> 00:04:11.165
The stable coin is pegged to

71
00:04:11.165 --> 00:04:14.355
something else like
the US dollar,

72
00:04:14.355 --> 00:04:18.575
but it can also be linked to
a basket of currencies or

73
00:04:18.575 --> 00:04:20.180
even an index like

74
00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.540
the Consumer Price Index
in the United States.

75
00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.925
Stable coins are important

76
00:04:25.925 --> 00:04:28.280
because they can
potentially avoid

77
00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.110
the price volatility that

78
00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.285
many cryptocurrencies experience.

79
00:04:33.285 --> 00:04:36.500
In addition to software wallets,

80
00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.035
blockchain also includes
hardware wallets.

81
00:04:40.035 --> 00:04:42.500
Again, these are very unlike

82
00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.510
the traditional wallet
that we all

83
00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:46.765
used to carry our cash.

84
00:04:46.765 --> 00:04:50.540
Hardware wallets are
physical devices that store

85
00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.540
private keys in a protected area

86
00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:56.585
within an actual hardware device.

87
00:04:56.585 --> 00:05:00.410
They are similar in
some ways to a paper wallet,

88
00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.320
but they're intended
to reduce incidents of

89
00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.755
large-scale
vulnerabilities and access

90
00:05:06.755 --> 00:05:08.105
to the private key.

91
00:05:08.105 --> 00:05:10.775
In addition,
many hardware wallets

92
00:05:10.775 --> 00:05:14.830
provide some resistance
to computer viruses.

93
00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:19.825
Within the blockchain
ecosystem and crypto finance,

94
00:05:19.825 --> 00:05:22.040
the blockchain merchant is

95
00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:26.210
a last but very important part
of the ecosystem.

96
00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.475
What is a blockchain merchant?

97
00:05:28.475 --> 00:05:32.060
A blockchain merchant is
simply a merchant that accepts

98
00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:36.065
Bitcoin or another
cryptocurrency as payment.

99
00:05:36.065 --> 00:05:39.410
In fact, you may have
noticed that now there are

100
00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:42.020
many blockchain merchants and

101
00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:46.270
many major retailers now
except cryptocurrency.

102
00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:50.150
Again in thinking about
the blockchain ecosystem.

103
00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:53.705
When we go beyond
the base layer of development,

104
00:05:53.705 --> 00:05:55.850
the next important level is

105
00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:58.765
crypto finance and
crypto FinTech.

106
00:05:58.765 --> 00:06:03.080
When we say crypto FinTech
we mean businesses that

107
00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:07.505
focus on the leveraging
and use of crypto assets.

108
00:06:07.505 --> 00:06:10.790
We talked previously
about trading.

109
00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:13.400
These platforms for exchanging

110
00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.410
cryptocurrencies are also

111
00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:18.275
an important part
of crypto FinTech.

112
00:06:18.275 --> 00:06:21.004
In addition, insurance companies

113
00:06:21.004 --> 00:06:24.470
operate in the crypto
Fintech space.

114
00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:27.844
These businesses insure against

115
00:06:27.844 --> 00:06:30.755
the theft of digital assets.

116
00:06:30.755 --> 00:06:34.730
But one of the challenges
of operating in this space,

117
00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:36.440
is that they don't actually know

118
00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:39.235
much about their customers.

119
00:06:39.235 --> 00:06:42.110
There's little data in this space

120
00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:45.530
as compared to
traditional insurance.

121
00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:48.110
So it's much harder for

122
00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:51.380
insurance companies insure
you against the theft of

123
00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:53.330
digital assets to do

124
00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:57.325
calculations important
to their businesses.

125
00:06:57.325 --> 00:07:00.380
Thus, crypto insurance companies

126
00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:03.500
spend a lot of time scrutinizing

127
00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:08.785
the security and storage
procedures for digital assets.

128
00:07:08.785 --> 00:07:13.595
The types of coverage that
they provide varies greatly.

129
00:07:13.595 --> 00:07:17.360
For example, they may
insure for theft of

130
00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:21.955
payments but they may not
cover issues of hacking.

131
00:07:21.955 --> 00:07:24.460
Crypto lending is

132
00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:28.945
another important and growing
area of crypto FinTech.

133
00:07:28.945 --> 00:07:32.590
Crypto lenders allow
individuals to

134
00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:37.090
lend against their digital
assets as collateral.

135
00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:40.885
For example, if one
wanted to take out

136
00:07:40.885 --> 00:07:44.530
a $10,000 loan they might
pay an interest rate,

137
00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:46.945
for example 15 percent.

138
00:07:46.945 --> 00:07:49.300
But in the crypto space

139
00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:54.100
the ratio of assets to
the loan is very important.

140
00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:58.045
These companies have to
require a high amount of

141
00:07:58.045 --> 00:08:03.105
assets in order to make
the loan, maybe 50 percent.

142
00:08:03.105 --> 00:08:07.485
So for example, for
a $10,000 loan,

143
00:08:07.485 --> 00:08:11.195
$20,000 worth of digital assets

144
00:08:11.195 --> 00:08:13.780
might be required as collateral.

145
00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:16.640
Finally, an important area of

146
00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:19.490
crypto FinTech is investment.

147
00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:24.620
Crypto investment funds undertake
cryptocurrency trading.

148
00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:28.580
This may include
100 percent cryptocurrency

149
00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:30.275
or they might mix

150
00:08:30.275 --> 00:08:33.605
cryptocurrency with
other types of assets.

151
00:08:33.605 --> 00:08:38.375
These investment funds operate
in a very diverse arena

152
00:08:38.375 --> 00:08:40.310
and continue to grow and

153
00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:44.160
change in their
dynamic over time.
