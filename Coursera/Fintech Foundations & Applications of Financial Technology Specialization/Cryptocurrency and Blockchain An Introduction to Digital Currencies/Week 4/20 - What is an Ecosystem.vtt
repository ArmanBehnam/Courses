00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:05.925
It's important to begin by

2
00:00:05.925 --> 00:00:08.430
understanding the
blockchain ecosystem.

3
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:10.860
The dynamics of
the blockchain are

4
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.380
rooted in its ecosystem.

5
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.605
That means the community
of producers,

6
00:00:16.605 --> 00:00:22.035
suppliers, customers,
stakeholders, and competitors.

7
00:00:22.035 --> 00:00:24.120
But it's also
important to note that

8
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.595
many smaller ecosystems also

9
00:00:26.595 --> 00:00:28.875
comprise the
blockchain ecosystem.

10
00:00:28.875 --> 00:00:32.100
In fact, many blockchain
companies do not

11
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.705
easily fit into one area
of the ecosystem,

12
00:00:35.705 --> 00:00:38.310
they can in fact encompass

13
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.585
more than one component
of that community.

14
00:00:41.585 --> 00:00:44.630
The blockchain ecosystem
is a living map,

15
00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:46.805
that exhibits constant change.

16
00:00:46.805 --> 00:00:49.220
It's important for us
to recognize that it

17
00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.040
will require
our continued attention,

18
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.265
study, and updating overtime.

19
00:00:55.265 --> 00:00:57.465
What is blockchain?

20
00:00:57.465 --> 00:01:01.070
Blockchain is a technology
that arose with

21
00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:06.155
the invention of the digital
currency Bitcoin in 2009.

22
00:01:06.155 --> 00:01:08.460
It is a shared,

23
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.240
immutable ledger that facilitates

24
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.290
the recording of
transactions in a network.

25
00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.035
Blockchain provides
the means for recording

26
00:01:18.035 --> 00:01:22.340
any transaction or track
the movement of any asset,

27
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.070
not just digital currency.

28
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.620
The assets recorded
on blockchain can

29
00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.185
be tangible such as cash,

30
00:01:30.185 --> 00:01:32.210
gold or real estate,

31
00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.740
or they can be intangible such
as intellectual property,

32
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.685
copyrights or even licenses.

33
00:01:39.685 --> 00:01:42.305
Blockchain stores data in blocks

34
00:01:42.305 --> 00:01:45.185
that are linked
together in a chain.

35
00:01:45.185 --> 00:01:47.990
Hence, the name blockchain.

36
00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.940
Thus, as the number of
transactions grows,

37
00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.600
so too does the blockchain.

38
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.450
Each block in the
blockchain contains a

39
00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.640
"hash" or digital fingerprint,

40
00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.910
a timestamped batch of
valid transactions,

41
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.010
and the hash or

42
00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:11.195
digital fingerprint of
the previous block in the chain.

43
00:02:11.195 --> 00:02:13.795
The previous block hash,

44
00:02:13.795 --> 00:02:17.990
links the blocks together
and prevents any block from

45
00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:23.305
being altered or any change
in the order of the blocks.

46
00:02:23.305 --> 00:02:25.080
Blocks are added to

47
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.980
the blockchain based
on a set of rules that

48
00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.510
are agreed on by the
participants in that network.

49
00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.300
As a result, each block in

50
00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.765
the blockchain strengthens
the verification

51
00:02:38.765 --> 00:02:40.570
of the previous block.

52
00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:43.820
This very intricate structure of

53
00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:48.055
the blockchain results in
several key attributes.

54
00:02:48.055 --> 00:02:51.745
First, the network
is decentralized,

55
00:02:51.745 --> 00:02:53.690
meaning it is spread across

56
00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.425
many different people or parties.

57
00:02:56.425 --> 00:02:59.630
Secondly, blockchain results in

58
00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.450
an increase in transparency since

59
00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.580
copies of the ledger or

60
00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.540
records are stored on
every single block.

61
00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.070
Security of the blockchain
is considered very strong,

62
00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:14.210
because of the use of

63
00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:17.750
both public and
private keys that are

64
00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.180
used to encrypt or
secure the blockchain.

65
00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.950
There's a lower
likelihood of hacking

66
00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.270
the block chain given
the immutable nature of it.

67
00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:33.140
Because of these key attributes
of the blockchain,

68
00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.915
it has a unique quality and

69
00:03:35.915 --> 00:03:39.575
the potential to transform
businesses over time.

70
00:03:39.575 --> 00:03:41.660
We'll explore this further in

71
00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.510
our discussion of the
blockchain ecosystem.
