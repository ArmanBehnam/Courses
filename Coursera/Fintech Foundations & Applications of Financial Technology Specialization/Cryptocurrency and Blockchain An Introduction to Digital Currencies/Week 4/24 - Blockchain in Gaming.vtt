00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.380
Within the blockchain
ecosystem, gaming is

2
00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.895
a very significant and growing
portion of the business.

3
00:00:11.895 --> 00:00:14.115
Gaming and esports is

4
00:00:14.115 --> 00:00:17.055
a really important
potential application

5
00:00:17.055 --> 00:00:19.515
for blockchain technology.

6
00:00:19.515 --> 00:00:22.920
In fact, gaming companies
have been creating

7
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.325
digital assets for
a very long time.

8
00:00:26.325 --> 00:00:29.420
So one could argue
that blockchain is

9
00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.065
just a natural step
in their evolution.

10
00:00:33.065 --> 00:00:36.260
Using blockchain, gamers can

11
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.200
create their own
virtual characters,

12
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.570
profiles, items or resources
for use within the game.

13
00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.240
This can transform
the user experience.

14
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.420
In addition, blockchain
and tokens give

15
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.445
users a new way to monetize
as they play games.

16
00:00:58.445 --> 00:01:02.510
Players can also buy
digital assets to use

17
00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.390
across games using
cryptocurrency.

18
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.190
Within the gaming space of
the blockchain ecosystem,

19
00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.830
gambling and
prediction markets is

20
00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.735
another potentially
significant application.

21
00:01:16.735 --> 00:01:20.300
Blockchain casinos
exist, they allow

22
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.930
anyone to become a member
of their casino.

23
00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.680
Here, the users can
potentially share funding

24
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.345
of the casino and
shares of profits.

25
00:01:31.345 --> 00:01:36.560
In fact, some blockchain
companies even use oracles or

26
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.990
predictors to create
what's known as

27
00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.835
a prediction market about
the outcome of an event.

28
00:01:42.835 --> 00:01:46.370
A final and very interesting
potential application for

29
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.765
blockchain in the gaming world
is in virtual reality.

30
00:01:50.765 --> 00:01:55.400
Virtual reality companies are
working to use blockchain

31
00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.045
to power an economy of
tradable digital assets,

32
00:02:00.045 --> 00:02:03.365
and blockchain can be
leveraged to create

33
00:02:03.365 --> 00:02:06.230
holographic avatars for use

34
00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.370
within the virtual reality game.
