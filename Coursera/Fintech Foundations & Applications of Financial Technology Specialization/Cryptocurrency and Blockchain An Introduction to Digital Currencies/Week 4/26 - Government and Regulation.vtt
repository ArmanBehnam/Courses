1
00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:08.370
Over time, many industries
and their ecosystems have

2
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.990
been significantly affected
by the role of regulation.

3
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.575
The same is true in
the blockchain ecosystem.

4
00:00:16.575 --> 00:00:18.870
Government and regulators play

5
00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:21.060
a very important role in

6
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.245
the development and application
of this technology.

7
00:00:25.245 --> 00:00:28.290
These regulators and entities

8
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:31.395
include: The Securities
Exchange Commission,

9
00:00:31.395 --> 00:00:34.740
The Commodity Futures
Trading Commission.

10
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:39.105
What's known as FinCEN and TFI.

11
00:00:39.105 --> 00:00:42.395
The Internal Revenue Service and

12
00:00:42.395 --> 00:00:46.040
both state and
international bodies.

13
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.784
The Securities
Exchange Commission

14
00:00:48.784 --> 00:00:50.855
has and continues to play

15
00:00:50.855 --> 00:00:53.510
a very significant role in

16
00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.770
the development of blockchain
and its application.

17
00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:03.020
The SEC governs the offer
and sale of securities as

18
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:08.815
set forth in what's known as
the Securities Act of 1933.

19
00:01:08.815 --> 00:01:14.270
Essentially, the SEC seeks
to reduce risk to investors

20
00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.195
from poor or inadequate or
even false information.

21
00:01:19.195 --> 00:01:22.625
Today, the SEC is very active

22
00:01:22.625 --> 00:01:25.790
in the blockchain
space and has issued

23
00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.950
a number of reports and

24
00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.540
guidances about the issue
and sale of tokens.

25
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:38.240
The SEC also uses a test
known as the how we test,

26
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.460
which relates to whether or
not something is a security.

27
00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.715
Moreover, because
blockchain technology

28
00:01:45.715 --> 00:01:50.000
spans not only the financial
services industry,

29
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.040
but multiple industries and

30
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.965
companies both in
the US and globally,

31
00:01:54.965 --> 00:01:59.570
the use and leverage of
the SEC's cyber unit has become

32
00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.285
increasingly important
when thinking

33
00:02:02.285 --> 00:02:04.835
about the application
of blockchain.

34
00:02:04.835 --> 00:02:08.975
A second very important
federal markets regulator

35
00:02:08.975 --> 00:02:12.455
is The Commodity Futures
Trading Commission.

36
00:02:12.455 --> 00:02:14.605
Or the CFTC.

37
00:02:14.605 --> 00:02:17.975
The CFTC is charged
with establishing

38
00:02:17.975 --> 00:02:20.000
a regulatory environment for

39
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.335
investors and
market participants.

40
00:02:23.335 --> 00:02:27.665
There are very specific
rules that separate

41
00:02:27.665 --> 00:02:30.065
the regulation of the SEC

42
00:02:30.065 --> 00:02:33.220
from the regulation of the CFTC.

43
00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:39.260
In 2014, the CFTC
declared cryptocurrencies

44
00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.235
to be a commodity and

45
00:02:41.235 --> 00:02:45.095
thus subject to
the oversight of the CFTC.

46
00:02:45.095 --> 00:02:48.230
The CFTC has within its purview,

47
00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.170
the registration of
futures exchanges,

48
00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.080
which is also important
to the use of

49
00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.000
blockchain technology and
the trading of cryptocurrency.

50
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.530
Finally, the CFTC
has set forth and

51
00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.610
approach to responsible
regulation and

52
00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.520
the promotion of
innovation to encourage

53
00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.295
the responsible and
positive development

54
00:03:10.295 --> 00:03:12.065
of this technology.

55
00:03:12.065 --> 00:03:14.000
In understanding the rules and

56
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.765
regulations related to
blockchain and cryptocurrency,

57
00:03:17.765 --> 00:03:20.270
it's very important to recognize

58
00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.685
the role of what's known
as FinCEN and TFI.

59
00:03:24.685 --> 00:03:26.360
FinCEN refers to

60
00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.155
the Financial Crimes
Enforcement Network and

61
00:03:30.155 --> 00:03:31.910
TFI refers to

62
00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.945
the Office of Terrorism
and Financial Intelligence.

63
00:03:35.945 --> 00:03:39.110
Both of these offices
relate to and

64
00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.655
enforce the Bank Secrecy Act.

65
00:03:42.655 --> 00:03:46.460
Thus, virtual currency
exchanges and

66
00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.920
administrators may be subject to

67
00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.905
the rules and
regulations of the BSA.

68
00:03:51.905 --> 00:03:54.010
The Bank Secrecy Act.

69
00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.720
Ultimately, what this means is

70
00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.180
that some of these
businesses may have to

71
00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.010
register with FinCEN as

72
00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.530
a money service business and
be subject to its oversight.

73
00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:10.190
Importantly, the IRS or
the Internal Revenue Service,

74
00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.435
also plays a role in the
regulation of the blockchain.

75
00:04:14.435 --> 00:04:16.940
As you know, the IRS collects and

76
00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.090
manages the revenue
of the United States.

77
00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:22.030
In the blockchain space,

78
00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.220
the IRS sets forth
the principles that apply

79
00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.715
to transactions using
virtual currency.

80
00:04:28.715 --> 00:04:31.130
In fact, it's possible that

81
00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:35.015
the IRS may treat
virtual currency as property,

82
00:04:35.015 --> 00:04:37.670
and therefore it
would be subject to

83
00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:42.115
tax principles that also
apply to real property.

84
00:04:42.115 --> 00:04:45.300
As the blockchain
ecosystem develops,

85
00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.755
state governments have
increasingly taken note

86
00:04:48.755 --> 00:04:53.345
and had the desire to play
a role in its development.

87
00:04:53.345 --> 00:04:56.570
State governments
in fact recognize

88
00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:59.510
that potentially
transformative power of

89
00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:01.490
blockchain and thus they're

90
00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.855
involved not only in regulation,

91
00:05:03.855 --> 00:05:07.310
but also in the promotion
of innovation.

92
00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:11.130
Some states such as
Delaware, or Illinois,

93
00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:12.840
or Wyoming have launched

94
00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.160
blockchain initiatives
designed to promote

95
00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.200
and enhance the development of

96
00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.905
this technology and
its application to business.

97
00:05:21.905 --> 00:05:26.900
Other states such as New York
has specific laws that may

98
00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.450
apply if the blockchain company

99
00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:31.955
is located within that state.

100
00:05:31.955 --> 00:05:34.615
In the blockchain
stake holder space,

101
00:05:34.615 --> 00:05:36.770
two more entities are

102
00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.400
important globally in
government and regulation.

103
00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:45.280
First, non-US regulators
play an important role.

104
00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.980
Secondly, international
standard-setting bodies,

105
00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.155
which don't have
the force of law,

106
00:05:51.155 --> 00:05:53.950
but do have the force
of consensus,

107
00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:57.140
also are very
significantly involved in

108
00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:01.250
the development of standards
related to this technology.

109
00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:04.295
Global regulators
are in the process

110
00:06:04.295 --> 00:06:06.815
of building rules and regulations

111
00:06:06.815 --> 00:06:08.600
that relate to the application of

112
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.965
blockchain and the trading
of cryptocurrency.

113
00:06:11.965 --> 00:06:14.650
An example of this is
the European Union,

114
00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:18.050
which is implemented
a Data Protection guidance that

115
00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:22.585
touches on many different
aspects of blockchain business.

116
00:06:22.585 --> 00:06:24.995
As this dynamic progresses,

117
00:06:24.995 --> 00:06:28.420
the harmonization of
data and laws across

118
00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:30.610
countries will be important to

119
00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:33.475
the innovation of
blockchain technology.

120
00:06:33.475 --> 00:06:36.175
International standards
setting bodies are

121
00:06:36.175 --> 00:06:39.530
also important in
the development of blockchain.

122
00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:41.590
While these standard
setting bodies

123
00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:43.570
do not have the force of law,

124
00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:45.865
they often have consensus,

125
00:06:45.865 --> 00:06:47.620
and therefore, the countries

126
00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:49.270
that are involved in them take

127
00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:51.055
the standards and apply them

128
00:06:51.055 --> 00:06:53.575
within their own jurisdictions.

129
00:06:53.575 --> 00:06:57.160
For example, the
Financial Stability Board

130
00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:00.520
consists of the G20 countries,

131
00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.200
and is currently working

132
00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:05.405
on monitoring
cryptocurrency markets.

133
00:07:05.405 --> 00:07:08.390
Another example is the BIS

134
00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:10.925
or Bank for International
Settlements,

135
00:07:10.925 --> 00:07:12.950
which is published a chapter on

136
00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:15.115
the risks of cryptocurrency.

137
00:07:15.115 --> 00:07:16.440
Make no mistake, as

138
00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:18.200
blockchain technology and

139
00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.720
its ecosystem
continue to develop,

140
00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:23.180
international standards
setting bodies will

141
00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:27.200
continue to play
an important role by studying,

142
00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:30.215
issuing guidance and
recommendations,

143
00:07:30.215 --> 00:07:32.870
and playing a role on
the country level,

144
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:35.000
as this technology continues

145
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.340
to develop and
transform business.
