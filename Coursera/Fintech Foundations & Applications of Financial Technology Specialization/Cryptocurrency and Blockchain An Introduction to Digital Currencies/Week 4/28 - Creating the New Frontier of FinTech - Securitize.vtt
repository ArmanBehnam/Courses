1
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.912
So I'm Jamie Finn, I'm the president and
co-founder of Securitize.

2
00:00:06.912 --> 00:00:13.193
We are a startup that was founded in 2017,
and we were founded based on the premise

3
00:00:13.193 --> 00:00:18.792
that there was a big gap in the technology
space around digital securities.

4
00:00:18.792 --> 00:00:23.213
So as of today, almost every security in
the world is done based on a piece of

5
00:00:23.213 --> 00:00:24.911
paper that somebody signs.

6
00:00:24.911 --> 00:00:28.079
We think that that's a pretty
inefficient model, and so

7
00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:32.963
what we've created is a digital version of
that leveraging blockchain technologies,

8
00:00:32.963 --> 00:00:35.141
both public and private blockchains.

9
00:00:35.141 --> 00:00:39.806
In order to create digital securities
that are more transparent,

10
00:00:39.806 --> 00:00:44.318
easier to trade, easy to use,
and just fundamentally better.

11
00:00:44.318 --> 00:00:47.321
I mean, at this point,
we're competing with paper, so

12
00:00:47.321 --> 00:00:49.582
we should be able to
make a better product.

13
00:00:49.582 --> 00:00:54.285
Blockchain technologies really enable
fundamentally new ways of interacting with

14
00:00:54.285 --> 00:00:56.414
both private and public securities.

15
00:00:56.414 --> 00:01:01.463
They enable all new ways of
understanding who owns these securities.

16
00:01:01.463 --> 00:01:04.559
You can see trades happening
live on a blockchain.

17
00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.930
You can see the whole transaction
happening end to end, and really,

18
00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.714
they create this environment of
transparency that isn't available today,

19
00:01:11.714 --> 00:01:13.883
particularly around private securities.

20
00:01:13.883 --> 00:01:16.072
So that is kind of where we started,
and really,

21
00:01:16.072 --> 00:01:19.000
one of the assets we started
with was venture funds.

22
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.700
Venture funds are a fundamentally
illiquid and very hard to access asset.

23
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.931
There's very little
information known about them,

24
00:01:26.931 --> 00:01:29.021
they are notoriously secretive.

25
00:01:29.021 --> 00:01:33.187
And so taking an asset like that and
making it available broadly to investors

26
00:01:33.187 --> 00:01:37.613
all over the world was something that we
thought was a really powerful concept and

27
00:01:37.613 --> 00:01:40.172
creates a really cool
new financial product.

28
00:01:40.172 --> 00:01:42.317
So that's really where we started, and so

29
00:01:42.317 --> 00:01:46.191
some of our customers are companies
like Blockchain Capital or SPiCE VC, and

30
00:01:46.191 --> 00:01:50.017
a number of other kind of venture funds
that we've worked with around that.

31
00:01:50.017 --> 00:01:52.930
And that's been kind of the point
of entry for our business.

32
00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.265
From there, we really moved into what most
people feel is one of the largest asset

33
00:01:57.265 --> 00:02:01.922
classes in the world that's almost totally
non-traded, although it is liquid, and

34
00:02:01.922 --> 00:02:03.099
that is real estate.

35
00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:06.636
So real estate's a new asset class,
it's also moving on to the blockchain.

36
00:02:06.636 --> 00:02:11.032
And we think it's actually a fantastic use
case, because you're taking an asset that

37
00:02:11.032 --> 00:02:14.536
has all sorts of different
components like debt, or equity, and

38
00:02:14.536 --> 00:02:18.121
putting it into a token which
represents ownership of this asset.

39
00:02:18.121 --> 00:02:21.121
This makes it so
that you can do something really unique,

40
00:02:21.121 --> 00:02:25.247
where you can buy a piece of a property
without actually taking the title of that

41
00:02:25.247 --> 00:02:27.265
property as part of the transaction.

42
00:02:27.265 --> 00:02:29.457
This is also an interesting
problem on the tax side.

43
00:02:29.457 --> 00:02:33.581
So one of our customers is the St.
Regis Hotel in Aspen, Colorado, and

44
00:02:33.581 --> 00:02:36.694
Aspen coin was one of our
first real estate projects.

45
00:02:36.694 --> 00:02:38.540
It's a single asset writ, and

46
00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.529
it's the first time that someone's
tokenized a chunk of a hotel.

47
00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:46.377
And now, every investor in that project
really has access to all the financial

48
00:02:46.377 --> 00:02:47.194
information and

49
00:02:47.194 --> 00:02:50.706
everything about that hotel through
this dashboard that we give them.

50
00:02:50.706 --> 00:02:53.361
And not only that,
the asset's liquid and tradable.

51
00:02:53.361 --> 00:02:55.744
So they can go on a secondary marketplace,
and

52
00:02:55.744 --> 00:02:59.469
they could sell it to somebody else who
would like to be an owner of the St.

53
00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:02.361
Regis, which is a fascinating
business opportunity.

54
00:03:02.361 --> 00:03:05.753
So Securitize was founded on
the premise of having to create and

55
00:03:05.753 --> 00:03:08.770
deliver something that worked
from the very first day.

56
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:13.458
If you look at the heritage of Securitize,
we were really born from a demand and

57
00:03:13.458 --> 00:03:14.888
a need from a customer.

58
00:03:14.888 --> 00:03:18.324
And so, from the very first day, we've
been totally focused on execution and

59
00:03:18.324 --> 00:03:18.957
delivering.

60
00:03:18.957 --> 00:03:22.471
We haven't really spent a lot of time
debating things like standards, and

61
00:03:22.471 --> 00:03:25.538
technologies, and what's the best
way you could do something,

62
00:03:25.538 --> 00:03:28.200
because we actually had to get it done.

63
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.800
And getting it done, we were able to kind
of create this track record of execution,

64
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.800
and that's what Securitize
is really best known for.

65
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.200
We deliver products.

66
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.903
We've really done the first
issuances of digital securities on

67
00:03:40.903 --> 00:03:42.055
an ethereum blockchain.

68
00:03:42.055 --> 00:03:43.500
There's a public blockchain.

69
00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.238
We've enabled trading on
in secondary markets for

70
00:03:46.238 --> 00:03:50.883
the first time ever of digital securities
with Ethereum, and we're the first company

71
00:03:50.883 --> 00:03:54.269
ever to have the same security
trading on multiple exchanges.

72
00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:55.657
This is a very big deal.

73
00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.800
A lot of people are interested
in what's known as an ICO, and

74
00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.803
you may have heard about
it from early in 2017.

75
00:04:03.803 --> 00:04:07.289
These were really fantastic capital
formation events that had happened

76
00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:10.300
on a global basis in a way that
nobody's ever seen before.

77
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.400
And it's really the fundamental
reason that STOs, or

78
00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.800
security token offerings, were created.

79
00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:20.147
When you could have an idea and
have somebody give you a $100 million for

80
00:04:20.147 --> 00:04:23.114
that idea for
you to do whatever you wanted with it,

81
00:04:23.114 --> 00:04:26.086
it's obviously going to
attract a lot of attention.

82
00:04:26.086 --> 00:04:29.677
And so that attention is really
what brought digital securities to

83
00:04:29.677 --> 00:04:30.831
the mainstream, and

84
00:04:30.831 --> 00:04:34.950
it's now kind of where ICOs have now
moved into the digital security realm.

85
00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:39.132
We have a whole bunch of new products that
are coming along, and for me personally,

86
00:04:39.132 --> 00:04:42.297
as an investor, it never really
made sense in the old ICO days,

87
00:04:42.297 --> 00:04:46.000
because it was simply you weren't
getting anything for your money.

88
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.800
Now, you're actually getting equity,
or revenue share, or

89
00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.100
some sort of distribution
associated with your investment.

90
00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.500
So at Securitize, we really believe
that all securities will eventually

91
00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:01.000
become digital assets, and they'll
be available on public blockchains.

92
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.920
So that's the future that we see, and

93
00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.042
we've seen that happen kind of
with every product over time.

94
00:05:06.042 --> 00:05:09.405
Things that start as physical products,
B2CD, or even a record,

95
00:05:09.405 --> 00:05:12.600
eventually ends up just being
a stream you get on Spotify.

96
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.200
Securities have been
the last thing to get there.

97
00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.688
Right now, most of these transactions
are still done on paper.

98
00:05:18.688 --> 00:05:24.539
So that has to go away, and we're
leading the charge to get rid of that.

99
00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:28.515
So right now, there's a trend going on,
and we've seen this trend in the past, and

100
00:05:28.515 --> 00:05:29.644
I'll liken it to that.

101
00:05:29.644 --> 00:05:34.051
So today in the blockchain space, we have
public blockchain such as Ethereum or

102
00:05:34.051 --> 00:05:38.064
Bitcoin, and then we have private
blockchains such as Hyperledger, or

103
00:05:38.064 --> 00:05:41.257
any number of other kind of
protocols that are out there.

104
00:05:41.257 --> 00:05:45.152
What's interesting about this space
is that we have a very similar

105
00:05:45.152 --> 00:05:46.692
thing to compare this to.

106
00:05:46.692 --> 00:05:51.400
So if you look back maybe 10,
20 years ago, everybody had a data center.

107
00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.106
And that was what you ran in order
to run your Internet products,

108
00:05:55.106 --> 00:05:56.800
you ran it into data center.

109
00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.743
Then flash forward to today,
everybody runs on cloud.

110
00:05:59.743 --> 00:06:02.877
If you're going to look at things
today in the blockchain world,

111
00:06:02.877 --> 00:06:06.496
what's happened is that people have
started in banks, in particular.

112
00:06:06.496 --> 00:06:09.583
Because I believe banks will end
up being the biggest users of

113
00:06:09.583 --> 00:06:12.126
digital ledger technologies or
blockchain, and

114
00:06:12.126 --> 00:06:14.985
they will eventually all end
up on a public blockchain.

115
00:06:14.985 --> 00:06:17.658
To get there, they're going to
start on private blockchain.

116
00:06:17.658 --> 00:06:22.490
Because just as in the past where
everybody was uncomfortable with a server

117
00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:26.642
in the cloud, and today,
the CIA runs their servers on Amazon.

118
00:06:26.642 --> 00:06:30.166
Eventually, even the financial
institutions will become comfortable with

119
00:06:30.166 --> 00:06:31.474
these public blockchains.

120
00:06:31.474 --> 00:06:34.270
Public blockchains are the right
long-term solution for

121
00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:37.465
all financial, products because
they offer the transparency and

122
00:06:37.465 --> 00:06:41.414
immutability that you're going to want,
and they have the controls that you need.

123
00:06:41.414 --> 00:06:43.758
Today, the banks aren't
comfortable with it.

124
00:06:43.758 --> 00:06:46.600
In the future, they definitely will be,
and that is the future of blockchain.

125
00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:52.651
The regulatory environment around
blockchain is relatively murky.

126
00:06:52.651 --> 00:06:57.520
Securitize has taken a position where
we feel that these are all securities.

127
00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.578
They are not some sort
of random token format.

128
00:07:00.578 --> 00:07:02.304
And we believe that as securities,

129
00:07:02.304 --> 00:07:06.167
they have to be treated that way under
the securities laws which exist in the US.

130
00:07:06.167 --> 00:07:08.795
In the US, our regulatory framework
is actually pretty clear and

131
00:07:08.795 --> 00:07:10.866
pretty good when it comes
to these types of things.

132
00:07:10.866 --> 00:07:15.117
Most people don't realize it, digital
securities were created and authorized

133
00:07:15.117 --> 00:07:19.378
to exist when Hurricane Sandy wiped out
almost all the paper records in New York.

134
00:07:19.378 --> 00:07:20.340
So after that,

135
00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:25.086
you could actually just have a digital
entry without any paper to back it up.

136
00:07:25.086 --> 00:07:26.360
That's a really big step, and

137
00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:29.450
it's actually one of the only countries
in the world where you can do that.

138
00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:32.642
So we think the US framework is
actually pretty good for issuing and

139
00:07:32.642 --> 00:07:34.181
managing digital securities.

140
00:07:34.181 --> 00:07:37.166
We're working across a number of other
countries with them on this topic.

141
00:07:37.166 --> 00:07:39.955
But just emphasizing the fact
that you can do this

142
00:07:39.955 --> 00:07:42.278
today on a blockchain in the US legally.

143
00:07:42.278 --> 00:07:45.844
As long as you follow the rules
that have existed since 1933 and

144
00:07:45.844 --> 00:07:47.945
then were updated in early 2000s,

145
00:07:47.945 --> 00:07:51.905
you're in a really good place to be
able to operate this type of business.

146
00:07:51.905 --> 00:07:55.960
At Securitize, we're looking always
to find people with true grit and

147
00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.063
people who are unwilling to give up.

148
00:07:58.063 --> 00:08:01.642
When you're doing a startup, the easiest
thing to do is to quit and to stop.

149
00:08:01.642 --> 00:08:05.669
Because actually, what you're doing at a
startup is probably not going to succeed.

150
00:08:05.669 --> 00:08:09.685
In fact, in 99.99% of the time,
it's just not going to work.

151
00:08:09.685 --> 00:08:14.944
But the 1%, or the tenth of 1% it works
is it extremely massive opportunity.

152
00:08:14.944 --> 00:08:17.358
So we really look for
people who have experience,

153
00:08:17.358 --> 00:08:21.093
not only kind of creating their own
business probably when they were younger,

154
00:08:21.093 --> 00:08:24.202
from a lemonade stand all the way
through to delivering papers.

155
00:08:24.202 --> 00:08:26.835
But also, generally,
if you're interested in marketing,

156
00:08:26.835 --> 00:08:28.159
be really great at marketing.

157
00:08:28.159 --> 00:08:30.738
Marketing is badly needed in FinTech.

158
00:08:30.738 --> 00:08:35.231
And all these different kind of components
are things you should really know about.

159
00:08:35.231 --> 00:08:38.394
Obviously, understanding numbers,
understanding balance sheets,

160
00:08:38.394 --> 00:08:42.138
understanding how cash flow is working,
all that's fundamental and really basic.

161
00:08:42.138 --> 00:08:45.635
But at the end of the day,
what we really are looking for is somebody

162
00:08:45.635 --> 00:08:49.462
who has the grit to not kind of give up
in the face of a pretty daunting task.

163
00:08:49.462 --> 00:08:52.665
And that's something that you're
going to find really rarely, and

164
00:08:52.665 --> 00:08:56.227
it takes a lot of effort and a lot of
interviews to go through with someone.

165
00:08:56.227 --> 00:08:59.471
And many times, those really great
people are already at great companies.

166
00:08:59.471 --> 00:09:02.185
So then, you have to try and
pull them out of there and

167
00:09:02.185 --> 00:09:05.783
bring them into this highly risky
environment, which is a startup.

168
00:09:05.783 --> 00:09:10.270
FinTech today is really controlled by
a few different very large entities.

169
00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:13.859
And whether or not you know it,
almost all of your money one way or

170
00:09:13.859 --> 00:09:18.263
another ends up in the hands of probably
eight or nine banks in the whole world.

171
00:09:18.263 --> 00:09:20.903
This is not something
that will last forever.

172
00:09:20.903 --> 00:09:24.509
It is changing, and it's changing because
people are becoming more empowered, and

173
00:09:24.509 --> 00:09:25.621
more people need access.

174
00:09:25.621 --> 00:09:29.521
If you look at millennials today,
which I'm barely missing out on,

175
00:09:29.521 --> 00:09:32.967
one of the most interesting
things is how unbanked they are.

176
00:09:32.967 --> 00:09:36.089
And then again, how comfortable
they are with digital assets and

177
00:09:36.089 --> 00:09:37.178
digital currencies.

178
00:09:37.178 --> 00:09:42.007
I really see things like Bitcoin and
other digital currencies becoming very

179
00:09:42.007 --> 00:09:46.241
mainstream in the long-term,
particularly as a store of value.

180
00:09:46.241 --> 00:09:50.282
And I think FinTech is going to have to
evolve to support this new generation of

181
00:09:50.282 --> 00:09:51.767
wealth that's coming up.

182
00:09:51.767 --> 00:09:54.647
All these folks who are coming
in this next generation

183
00:09:54.647 --> 00:09:56.376
understand digital natively.

184
00:09:56.376 --> 00:09:59.753
And if your FinTech products aren't
natively digital, and you have to

185
00:09:59.753 --> 00:10:03.429
make a phone call to get something done,
they are not going to be your customer.
