1
00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:06.940
To recap, the
blockchain ecosystem is

2
00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:11.155
a living dynamic ever
changing ecosystem,

3
00:00:11.155 --> 00:00:13.870
with many different stakeholders.

4
00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:16.215
To mention a few of them,

5
00:00:16.215 --> 00:00:18.330
we would include investors,

6
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.730
the government and regulation,

7
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.570
and media and advocates.

8
00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.015
No ecosystem can exist
without resources,

9
00:00:28.015 --> 00:00:31.000
and those are
the investors that pour

10
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.760
their resources into
different components

11
00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.010
of the blockchain community.

12
00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.660
In addition, the government
sets rules and

13
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.655
regulations around
the development

14
00:00:42.655 --> 00:00:45.400
and use of blockchain technology,

15
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.080
and by different businesses.

16
00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.050
Finally, the media and

17
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.110
advocates in Washington DC
and elsewhere,

18
00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.825
have been important
sources of information

19
00:00:56.825 --> 00:01:01.115
an influence as the blockchain
ecosystem develops.

20
00:01:01.115 --> 00:01:04.435
Investment in the
blockchain is organic,

21
00:01:04.435 --> 00:01:08.510
spanning across
multiple types of investors.

22
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.215
These investments can come
in many different forms.

23
00:01:12.215 --> 00:01:17.605
For example, initial
coin offerings or ICOs.

24
00:01:17.605 --> 00:01:19.820
Venture capitalists are

25
00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.890
business people who
had been pouring

26
00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.350
resources into the development
and use of the blockchain.

27
00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.250
Corporations also serve as
investors in this space,

28
00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.165
both for their own businesses
and in new businesses.

29
00:01:35.165 --> 00:01:39.470
Consortia of many
different types also put

30
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.795
resources into
different components

31
00:01:41.795 --> 00:01:44.450
of the blockchain
business ecosystem.

32
00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.755
In thinking about investment
in the blockchain,

33
00:01:47.755 --> 00:01:49.935
it's important to talk about

34
00:01:49.935 --> 00:01:54.330
ICOs or initial coin offerings.

35
00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.230
An initial coin
offering is simply

36
00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:01.370
a fundraising mechanism
for new types of projects.

37
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.895
Cryptocurrencies
are sold an ICO is

38
00:02:04.895 --> 00:02:08.765
in the form of coins or tokens,

39
00:02:08.765 --> 00:02:12.410
these coins or tokens
are sold to investors in

40
00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.425
exchange for some item
or even another token.

41
00:02:16.425 --> 00:02:20.000
Today, ICOs may serve as

42
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.470
an important source of

43
00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.430
resources for the development
of the blockchain.

44
00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.210
Venture capitalists
have long served as

45
00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:33.200
important sources of
resources for new businesses.

46
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.010
The same is true
for the blockchain.

47
00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.820
Today, venture capital provides

48
00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.205
active investment in many
different blockchain companies.

49
00:02:43.205 --> 00:02:46.715
Here, venture capitalists support

50
00:02:46.715 --> 00:02:50.575
and incubate,or grow
new businesses.

51
00:02:50.575 --> 00:02:53.840
In fact, there are
many different ways that

52
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.035
venture capitalists can
invest in blockchain.

53
00:02:57.035 --> 00:02:59.240
For example, they could invest

54
00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.905
directly into
initial coin offerings,

55
00:03:02.905 --> 00:03:04.580
they may invest in

56
00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.245
cryptocurrency companies
such as token exchanges.

57
00:03:09.245 --> 00:03:12.320
There are many venture
capital companies

58
00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.305
that are exploring
blockchain payments,

59
00:03:15.305 --> 00:03:18.560
or venture capitalists
may explore

60
00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.890
investments in other use cases
for blockchain.

61
00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.925
Many of which we've
talked about today.

62
00:03:24.925 --> 00:03:29.555
Finally, venture capitalists
in private companies,

63
00:03:29.555 --> 00:03:33.560
are building enterprise
blockchain solutions that can

64
00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.110
span across companies and

65
00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.245
leverage the use of
blockchain technology.

66
00:03:39.245 --> 00:03:42.830
As the blockchain ecosystem
grows and develops,

67
00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:44.825
we note that it affects

68
00:03:44.825 --> 00:03:49.040
not only new companies but
also existing companies,

69
00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.270
many of which are

70
00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:54.325
large corporations or
even the Fortune 500.

71
00:03:54.325 --> 00:03:58.130
Today, corporate investment
in the blockchain is

72
00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.000
an important source of
resources for development.

73
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.940
Corporate investments
are investments by

74
00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.195
traditional companies into
blockchain companies.

75
00:04:09.195 --> 00:04:13.460
Since 2012, more than one
billion dollars has been

76
00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:17.690
invested by corporations
into blockchain technology,

77
00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.800
and that number is
growing rapidly.

78
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.125
It's important to mention,

79
00:04:23.125 --> 00:04:25.220
that there are different types of

80
00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.265
blockchains, private and public.

81
00:04:29.265 --> 00:04:31.070
Due to the nature of

82
00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.090
the technology and it's
distributed element,

83
00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.750
there are private blockchains
that are available to

84
00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.240
just a few companies or group

85
00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.380
of companies rather
than to everyone.

86
00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.990
Today, consortia are sources of

87
00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.420
investment that can fall between

88
00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:53.395
private and public blockchains.

89
00:04:53.395 --> 00:04:56.210
Today, investments from consortia

90
00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:57.995
into the blockchain bring

91
00:04:57.995 --> 00:04:59.930
organizations from the same

92
00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.245
vertical onto
a distributed database.

93
00:05:03.245 --> 00:05:05.515
This creates a middle option,

94
00:05:05.515 --> 00:05:08.315
the security of
a private blockchain

95
00:05:08.315 --> 00:05:12.450
with the network effects
of a public blockchain.
