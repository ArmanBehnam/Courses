00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.000
Hi, my name is Prakash Neehkantan.

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I'm part of Broadridge, a $4 billion firm,
which is part of the S&P 500.

3
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.249
We enable corporate governance and

4
00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:19.127
transactions in the capital
markets in Broadridge.

5
00:00:19.127 --> 00:00:24.126
I am part of the copper strategy group,
helping drive innovation and

6
00:00:24.126 --> 00:00:27.525
adoption of blockchain
among our customers.

7
00:00:27.525 --> 00:00:31.572
Broadridge has a vantage
point in this space,

8
00:00:31.572 --> 00:00:35.307
because we sit in the middle of investors,

9
00:00:35.307 --> 00:00:39.356
advisors to brokerage firms and
operations,

10
00:00:39.356 --> 00:00:44.572
enabling products and
services across all these parties.

11
00:00:44.572 --> 00:00:49.163
Broadridge processes more than $5 trillion
worth of transactions in fixed income and

12
00:00:49.163 --> 00:00:50.900
equity markets.

13
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.200
We also enable communication for

14
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:59.000
5,000 brands to more than 75%
of North American households.

15
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.400
We also manage shareholder
voting in 90 countries.

16
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.700
Broadridge is a fintech firm, actually.

17
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.235
And fintech is,
I think it's many things for many people.

18
00:01:11.235 --> 00:01:12.431
But if you look at it,

19
00:01:12.431 --> 00:01:16.300
automation is at the heart of
every financial services firm.

20
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.989
So it is very difficult to say
that no financial services

21
00:01:20.989 --> 00:01:23.495
firm is not fintech, right?

22
00:01:23.495 --> 00:01:27.707
But what differentiates them is actually,
financial services firm existing, there

23
00:01:27.707 --> 00:01:31.744
is existing financial services firms sit
in the middle of lot of transaction data,

24
00:01:31.744 --> 00:01:35.223
which they've been servicing their
customers for many, many years.

25
00:01:35.223 --> 00:01:39.451
And they leverage technology to
deliver many of their services.

26
00:01:39.451 --> 00:01:45.796
What we have seen in the last 20 years is
the growth of the web, the mobile, and

27
00:01:45.796 --> 00:01:52.456
aggregation of humongous amounts of data
across the globe, by a variety of firms.

28
00:01:52.456 --> 00:01:58.486
What fintechs are trying to do different
from traditional financial services firm,

29
00:01:58.486 --> 00:02:02.338
are leveraging this connectivity,
and the data, and

30
00:02:02.338 --> 00:02:07.800
innovate on new business models to
service this traditional customer base.

31
00:02:09.724 --> 00:02:11.700
Broadridge's strategy is very simple.

32
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.400
We are in the middle of this transaction
flow among all our customers,

33
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.400
servicing this larger market of investors.

34
00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.900
Our goal is to make this market
more transparent, efficient,

35
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.800
and cost-effective,
driving new services to our customers.

36
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.420
We do that by adopting
a next-generation set of

37
00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.279
technologies, which we
call ABCD in short form.

38
00:02:41.279 --> 00:02:45.500
That is AI, blockchain, cloud,
and digital in a broad sense.

39
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.298
It's interesting too that we put it in
the ABCD, but the reality is, actually,

40
00:02:51.298 --> 00:02:53.167
what we want to do is very simple.

41
00:02:53.167 --> 00:02:58.231
We want to drive all
communication to customers

42
00:02:58.231 --> 00:03:04.441
in a digital native form,
through a variety of channels.

43
00:03:04.441 --> 00:03:09.176
And servicing them anywhere through

44
00:03:09.176 --> 00:03:14.983
the cloud through a cloud
hosted mechanism.

45
00:03:14.983 --> 00:03:18.332
And share data through
blockchain in a sense, and

46
00:03:18.332 --> 00:03:21.055
solve innovative problems through AI.

47
00:03:21.055 --> 00:03:24.300
I would say that exists in our strategy.

48
00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:29.200
We believe in partnering,
as well as working with our customers, and

49
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.700
building these new solutions.

50
00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:37.100
We have invested also in startups,
and other fintechs, and

51
00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.200
collaboratively work towards
new solutions in this area.

52
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.600
So when our customers ask us about
fintech, or any of these new technologies,

53
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.300
our first goal is to identify
what business challenges and

54
00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.300
problems they're trying to solve for,
right?

55
00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.004
For our customers, cost could be a driver.

56
00:03:56.004 --> 00:03:59.300
They want to deliver
more efficient solutions.

57
00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.900
They might want to grow into new markets,
new customer segments.

58
00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.900
They would also like to
actually provide innovative new

59
00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.500
solutions to any of these customers.

60
00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.399
What we say is actually before
choosing the technology,

61
00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:19.800
let's analyze the problem
space at the business area.

62
00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:25.100
Figure out whether this is the appropriate
technology to use and solve for.

63
00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.100
And then we work with
them collaboratively,

64
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:33.600
as well as actually technology providers
to innovate and design new solutions.

65
00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.600
That's been our strategy
always with customers.

66
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.800
The goal is to actually understand
the problem, and then solve for

67
00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.300
it using technology.

68
00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.800
Technology does not come first,
whether it's blockchain or AI.

69
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.500
For many people, blockchain is
something is a technology looking for

70
00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.900
a problem, and that is true for
many of our customers.

71
00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.300
To everybody that's been experimenting
with this technology, our advice has been

72
00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:01.512
to actually focus on specific business
areas from a broader perspective.

73
00:05:01.512 --> 00:05:05.300
We want to solve for
what is called network effect.

74
00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:10.136
That idea is actually that the solution
becomes more effective as more and

75
00:05:10.136 --> 00:05:14.435
more customers, and
their business partners join the network.

76
00:05:14.435 --> 00:05:16.589
And we being in the middle of the data and

77
00:05:16.589 --> 00:05:20.519
the transaction flow can actually
help them effectively manage this.

78
00:05:20.519 --> 00:05:26.047
Blockchain is such a technology which
can actually enable, secure efficient

79
00:05:26.047 --> 00:05:31.923
sharing with confidentiality of data and
transaction between multiple parties.

80
00:05:31.923 --> 00:05:34.902
And our goal has been to pick
specific business areas,

81
00:05:34.902 --> 00:05:38.000
which can be solved using
blockchain technology.

82
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.600
So when we apply blockchain technology,
right, we chose, say,

83
00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:44.900
a multi-pronged strategy.

84
00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:49.700
We decided to partner with
startups in the space.

85
00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.754
We have investments in a firm,
like digital asset.

86
00:05:52.754 --> 00:05:57.046
We are also members of actually technology
consortiums like Enterprise Ethereum, and

87
00:05:57.046 --> 00:05:57.800
Hyper Ledger.

88
00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:04.108
We invested in these technologies,
built pilots and proof of concepts,

89
00:06:04.108 --> 00:06:09.072
and then collaborate a jointly with
customers like Santander Bank,

90
00:06:09.072 --> 00:06:11.469
and Northern Trust, JP Morgan,

91
00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:16.967
to build out solutions with specific
use cases in mind, like proxy voting.

92
00:06:16.967 --> 00:06:22.616
Which brings in efficiency and trust
into the corporate governance process.

93
00:06:22.616 --> 00:06:25.807
Fintech is, as I said,
many things for many people.

94
00:06:25.807 --> 00:06:30.752
Established players, like us, actually,
are using a fintech very efficiently and

95
00:06:30.752 --> 00:06:31.722
innovatively.

96
00:06:31.722 --> 00:06:35.463
One of the areas we are applying this,
actually,

97
00:06:35.463 --> 00:06:39.039
there is still a lot of
paper in our businesses.

98
00:06:39.039 --> 00:06:44.037
And what we are doing is actually
extracting text from copies of

99
00:06:44.037 --> 00:06:47.715
the digital copies of
these paper documents,

100
00:06:47.715 --> 00:06:52.731
converting them into specific attributes,
which we can use.

101
00:06:52.731 --> 00:06:56.292
Say for instance,
in a process like trade allocation,

102
00:06:56.292 --> 00:07:01.463
where the allocation instructions come
as faxes, or actually emails, right?

103
00:07:01.463 --> 00:07:06.627
Or even actually paper documents, which
are scanned and actually processed later.

104
00:07:06.627 --> 00:07:11.145
Extracting text from images is actually
optical character recognition,

105
00:07:11.145 --> 00:07:13.303
which is a form of computer vision.

106
00:07:13.303 --> 00:07:16.531
And that is getting better and
better, applying machine learning.

107
00:07:16.531 --> 00:07:20.683
And extracting actually information
from text is actually natural

108
00:07:20.683 --> 00:07:23.895
language processing,
which is also part of the AI.

109
00:07:23.895 --> 00:07:27.636
Data actually is available
in plenty today.

110
00:07:27.636 --> 00:07:32.650
And so
what could not be applied earlier becomes

111
00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:38.427
a new potential innovative
area to apply technology.

112
00:07:38.427 --> 00:07:41.143
The classic example,
for instance, markets.

113
00:07:41.143 --> 00:07:45.060
As you all know,
being in the financial services space,

114
00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:48.091
which brings buyers and sellers together.

115
00:07:48.091 --> 00:07:52.106
Traditionally, liquid markets,
like say for instance,

116
00:07:52.106 --> 00:07:56.535
NASDAQ or NYC, where the top
500 stocks are actively traded.

117
00:07:56.535 --> 00:08:00.658
You can always find a seller at a price
which is actually available to you if you

118
00:08:00.658 --> 00:08:01.363
are a buyer.

119
00:08:01.363 --> 00:08:06.355
But in some markets like corporate bonds,
and especially in the long tail of

120
00:08:06.355 --> 00:08:10.021
these corporate bond market,
it's very difficult and

121
00:08:10.021 --> 00:08:14.167
expensive to find a buyer or
a seller, or bring them together.

122
00:08:14.167 --> 00:08:17.864
What we are doing is actually
trying to apply machine learning,

123
00:08:17.864 --> 00:08:21.082
based on the history of
transactions of participants,

124
00:08:21.082 --> 00:08:25.615
to identify whether there are similar
products that they have bought before.

125
00:08:25.615 --> 00:08:28.126
Which will actually make them buy, or

126
00:08:28.126 --> 00:08:31.895
actually show interest in
buying this new bond, right?

127
00:08:31.895 --> 00:08:36.012
And that's an innovative way to think of
it, actually like how Amazon works for

128
00:08:36.012 --> 00:08:37.866
you with recommendation engines.

129
00:08:37.866 --> 00:08:40.885
You bought these products in the past, so

130
00:08:40.885 --> 00:08:45.987
you might be a potential buyer for
the similar product today, right?

131
00:08:45.987 --> 00:08:49.939
But we are applying a similar technology,
actually, in the bond market.

132
00:08:49.939 --> 00:08:53.291
If you look at exciting fintechs,
there are a range of fintechs.

133
00:08:53.291 --> 00:08:57.228
I mentioned that they apply innovative
business models, solve problems.

134
00:08:57.228 --> 00:08:59.791
They can solve mundane problems.

135
00:08:59.791 --> 00:09:03.542
One company which has been a fintech for
quite some time,

136
00:09:03.542 --> 00:09:06.756
a lot of people might be
familiar with this name.

137
00:09:06.756 --> 00:09:13.738
It's Stripe, Stripe makes the traditional
legacy payment infrastructure of banks,

138
00:09:13.738 --> 00:09:17.899
and the banking network
simple to use through APIs.

139
00:09:17.899 --> 00:09:23.115
We think that that's a very
innovative use of technology

140
00:09:23.115 --> 00:09:30.179
to take a backend back office problem,
and simplifying the whole process for

141
00:09:30.179 --> 00:09:35.631
all these companies coming online and
enabling payments.

142
00:09:35.631 --> 00:09:37.854
Another example is actually Acorns,

143
00:09:37.854 --> 00:09:42.443
which is actually start-up in the fintech
space, which is solving savings.

144
00:09:42.443 --> 00:09:47.887
They do what I would
call nudge based savings.

145
00:09:47.887 --> 00:09:53.613
They help you save by taking small
chunks out of your regular transactions,

146
00:09:53.613 --> 00:09:56.127
and influencing your behavior.

147
00:09:56.127 --> 00:09:57.248
So that actually,

148
00:09:57.248 --> 00:10:01.955
you build up your savings account over
a period of time incrementally, right?

149
00:10:01.955 --> 00:10:06.383
That's a very innovative model which
combines behavioral science actually, and

150
00:10:06.383 --> 00:10:07.531
economics, right?

151
00:10:07.531 --> 00:10:12.555
Solving the problem, which is a very
challenging problem in today's world,

152
00:10:12.555 --> 00:10:16.451
because with the savings rate
in the US is actually very low.

153
00:10:16.451 --> 00:10:20.071
In my belief,
singularity is still far away, right?

154
00:10:20.071 --> 00:10:22.113
Fintech, as we call it today,

155
00:10:22.113 --> 00:10:26.589
the ideal future would be that
nobody calls it fintech anymore, and

156
00:10:26.589 --> 00:10:31.711
becomes part of everyday life, and
that's been true of lots of technology.

157
00:10:31.711 --> 00:10:34.763
Today we don't talk about e-commerce,
right?

158
00:10:34.763 --> 00:10:38.696
But everybody uses e-commerce,
and the same thing for

159
00:10:38.696 --> 00:10:41.464
streaming media and Netflix, right?

160
00:10:41.464 --> 00:10:45.359
We have cut the cord, and it's become
a natural progression of things.

161
00:10:45.359 --> 00:10:46.014
We believe,

162
00:10:46.014 --> 00:10:49.831
I think, the fintech world, it'll also
evolve in a very similar fashion.

163
00:10:49.831 --> 00:10:53.324
Technology changes actually too fast for
us, actually,

164
00:10:53.324 --> 00:10:55.471
to label it in different fashions.

165
00:10:55.471 --> 00:10:57.482
If you go back a few years,

166
00:10:57.482 --> 00:11:02.243
nobody would have started using
the term Chief Data Officer.

167
00:11:02.243 --> 00:11:05.411
But today,
many companies have Chief Data Officer.

168
00:11:05.411 --> 00:11:10.340
Well the last five years, many
corporations also have digital officers

169
00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:16.507
who enable, actually, digital embedding,
digital processes across every business.

170
00:11:16.507 --> 00:11:20.894
In a similar fashion, fintechs or
financial services firms would have

171
00:11:20.894 --> 00:11:24.111
actually officers driving
customer behavior, and

172
00:11:24.111 --> 00:11:26.755
varieties of forms applying technology.

173
00:11:26.755 --> 00:11:29.543
You might want to call
them a fintech officer.

174
00:11:29.543 --> 00:11:33.094
You might want to call them actually
somebody driving innovation and

175
00:11:33.094 --> 00:11:33.848
technology.

176
00:11:33.848 --> 00:11:38.071
You might want to call them
somebody driving AI and blockchain.

177
00:11:38.071 --> 00:11:42.556
None of that matters, because the end
result is actually that you're adapting to

178
00:11:42.556 --> 00:11:45.615
actually technology, and
servicing your customers.

179
00:11:45.615 --> 00:11:49.711
Small businesses actually
are the ones which

180
00:11:49.711 --> 00:11:53.923
can actually get maximum impact or
a fintech.

181
00:11:53.923 --> 00:11:58.085
We always talk about the unbanked, but
actually, we should talk about also

182
00:11:58.085 --> 00:12:01.870
the banked, which is actually
lots of small mom-and-pop stores.

183
00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:06.852
Which actually service their
customers either through credit

184
00:12:06.852 --> 00:12:09.955
card payments, right, and not cash.

185
00:12:09.955 --> 00:12:15.001
And also have a challenge of getting
financing to stock the appropriate

186
00:12:15.001 --> 00:12:19.387
inventory for them to service
their customers efficiently.

187
00:12:19.387 --> 00:12:22.556
What can happen in
the future is two things,

188
00:12:22.556 --> 00:12:27.786
because they are willing to share
their transaction history, banks can

189
00:12:27.786 --> 00:12:33.547
actually apply machine learning on that
data, and actually build new models.

190
00:12:33.547 --> 00:12:38.860
Which can ensure that, actually,
without traditional history,

191
00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:41.759
they are still a good bet to finance.

192
00:12:41.759 --> 00:12:45.079
Right, that's one dimension.

193
00:12:45.079 --> 00:12:47.915
Take the case of a student.

194
00:12:47.915 --> 00:12:52.883
There are many forms in
which this can apply, right?

195
00:12:52.883 --> 00:12:58.319
The simplest form actually, fintech can
apply student to student loans, right?

196
00:12:58.319 --> 00:13:02.983
The model is changing, there are new
models being created for financing.

197
00:13:02.983 --> 00:13:06.844
We have seen some startups,
actually, like SoFi,

198
00:13:06.844 --> 00:13:10.635
which are actually focused
only on student loans.

199
00:13:10.635 --> 00:13:15.773
What you want is actually to enable
a larger set of students to get

200
00:13:15.773 --> 00:13:21.215
loans at a lower rate if needed, and
a potential for them to pay off.

201
00:13:21.215 --> 00:13:24.875
Actually, they are loans over a period
of time, or even reduce those loans.

202
00:13:24.875 --> 00:13:29.535
So one area, right, so when we talked
about financing, right, blockchain for

203
00:13:29.535 --> 00:13:30.711
instance, right?

204
00:13:30.711 --> 00:13:34.003
Right, let's take a large manufacturer.

205
00:13:34.003 --> 00:13:38.559
We just got actually a large supplier,
right?

206
00:13:38.559 --> 00:13:41.107
For example, this is just an example.

207
00:13:41.107 --> 00:13:44.267
It could be a large car company, right?

208
00:13:44.267 --> 00:13:47.183
Which has got an automotive
parts supplier.

209
00:13:47.183 --> 00:13:51.632
One supplier here, main supplier,
say, in China, and

210
00:13:51.632 --> 00:13:57.763
that Chinese supplier has got actually
50 other vendors who supply to them.

211
00:13:57.763 --> 00:14:02.285
What happens in the traditional
financing space is actually the large

212
00:14:02.285 --> 00:14:05.272
supplier to this car company
can go to a bank and

213
00:14:05.272 --> 00:14:09.503
get financing as they supply
actually parts to this car company.

214
00:14:09.503 --> 00:14:14.519
But the second and third firms which
actually supply the final parts

215
00:14:14.519 --> 00:14:19.183
to this primary supplier are always
in the middle of a process,

216
00:14:19.183 --> 00:14:23.671
where they do not have visibility
to the final transaction of

217
00:14:23.671 --> 00:14:28.347
what part has actually gone into
the manufacturing of the car.

218
00:14:28.347 --> 00:14:30.579
And when will they get paid?

219
00:14:30.579 --> 00:14:34.810
And this is where something like
blockchain is actually transforming

220
00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:39.396
the supply chain, where every party to
this transaction can actually track

221
00:14:39.396 --> 00:14:42.566
every part that the supply
across the supply chain.

222
00:14:42.566 --> 00:14:46.787
And make it visible as they raise invoices
to their banks, and the banks would,

223
00:14:46.787 --> 00:14:51.323
actually, now with confidence know that
this part went into this larger component,

224
00:14:51.323 --> 00:14:53.850
which then got supplied
to say General Motors.

225
00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:57.740
And so they know where in
the pipeline this part is, and

226
00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:01.303
they can confidently lend
to the small supplier.

227
00:15:01.303 --> 00:15:05.974
This way, I think small businesses across
the globe can get transformed, and

228
00:15:05.974 --> 00:15:09.035
we are just seeing the start
of this process today.

229
00:15:09.035 --> 00:15:13.367
There is no hard and
fast rule about career today.

230
00:15:13.367 --> 00:15:16.125
You could in any,
if you're looking at the fintech space,

231
00:15:16.125 --> 00:15:18.828
you could start on the technology
side of the business, or

232
00:15:18.828 --> 00:15:22.271
you could start in the business side and
the product side of the business.

233
00:15:22.271 --> 00:15:26.280
Now, if you are by training
a technologist, it might be good to

234
00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:31.059
educate yourself in a particular domain
in the financial services space.

235
00:15:31.059 --> 00:15:34.916
And because that's going to be more
valuable, a technologist with business

236
00:15:34.916 --> 00:15:38.120
knowledge is more valuable than
just actually say a developer or

237
00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:39.267
programmer, right?

238
00:15:39.267 --> 00:15:42.844
The same goes for the other side, because
if you're a product manager today in

239
00:15:42.844 --> 00:15:45.891
a fintech firm, in your startup,
actually, it's a small team.

240
00:15:45.891 --> 00:15:49.803
You need to actually roll up your
sleeves and do lots of activities.

241
00:15:49.803 --> 00:15:53.763
You will not be a good product manager
with lots of good domain knowledge

242
00:15:53.763 --> 00:15:57.599
unless you also know how that product
can be realized in technology.

243
00:15:57.599 --> 00:16:01.385
So you need to know the limits of the
technologies, how it can be applied, and

244
00:16:01.385 --> 00:16:05.183
also help manage technologists and
developers, actually, to build this.

245
00:16:05.183 --> 00:16:07.906
That, I think, is a key skill.

246
00:16:07.906 --> 00:16:11.714
And so for business and
financial professionals actually getting

247
00:16:11.714 --> 00:16:16.610
a better sense of actually technology,
and understanding technology is, I think,

248
00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:20.010
a good supplement to what they
are already learnt, right?

249
00:16:20.010 --> 00:16:24.643
The combination for both would be data,
because if you are building something new

250
00:16:24.643 --> 00:16:29.627
today, the process of building something
new is completely become analytic, right?

251
00:16:29.627 --> 00:16:33.311
You actually start with
the concept validated the market,

252
00:16:33.311 --> 00:16:35.307
analyze, get people to use it.

253
00:16:35.307 --> 00:16:39.357
Look at the data, analyze it further,
decide whether it's working or not,

254
00:16:39.357 --> 00:16:40.490
pivot to a new model.

255
00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:44.465
And this continuous process needs
actually data and analytic skills, so

256
00:16:44.465 --> 00:16:47.735
I would always supplement
something on data and analytics,

257
00:16:47.735 --> 00:16:49.800
along with your traditional degree.
