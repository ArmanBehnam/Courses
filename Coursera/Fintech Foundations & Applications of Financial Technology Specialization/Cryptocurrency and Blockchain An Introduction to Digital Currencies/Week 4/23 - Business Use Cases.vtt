1
00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:07.170
In understanding
the blockchain ecosystem,

2
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.085
another very important
component of that ecosystem,

3
00:00:11.085 --> 00:00:13.620
is the business use-case.

4
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.549
Beyond development and
finance, there are many,

5
00:00:17.549 --> 00:00:21.735
many business use-cases
for blockchain technology.

6
00:00:21.735 --> 00:00:26.085
Today, we're going to talk
about just a few of them.

7
00:00:26.085 --> 00:00:28.980
We divide the
business use-cases of

8
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.790
the ecosystem into
four different categories,

9
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.210
value exchange, shared data,

10
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.250
authenticity, and
diversified financial.

11
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.670
Value exchange is

12
00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.870
an important business use-case
for blockchain technology.

13
00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.835
In a value exchange,

14
00:00:49.835 --> 00:00:52.310
the content industry is the one

15
00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.220
that is most primed
for disruption.

16
00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.510
The content industry hasn't
changed much over time,

17
00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.830
it is very extensive
and largely offline.

18
00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.730
Content involves
creators, distributors,

19
00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:09.710
and many different formats.

20
00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.245
For example, content
on your mobile phone,

21
00:01:13.245 --> 00:01:18.030
television, cable TV, and movies.

22
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.090
Consumers of content are global,

23
00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.525
not just local, and the cost

24
00:01:23.525 --> 00:01:26.615
of distributing
content are very high.

25
00:01:26.615 --> 00:01:29.900
In addition, the rights
to content can

26
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.310
be tied up for
long periods of time.

27
00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.560
Blockchain offers
a potential solution

28
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.290
to improve the world of content.

29
00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.560
Blockchain can move
more marketplaces

30
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.795
onto a distributed ledger

31
00:01:44.795 --> 00:01:47.540
and derive content
trading between

32
00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.130
the producers and the
buyers of content.

33
00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.185
Blockchain facilitates
the funding

34
00:01:54.185 --> 00:01:56.540
of creative ideas as well,

35
00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.500
and potentially offers
increased transparency

36
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.715
in the sharing of
the rights of content.

37
00:02:03.715 --> 00:02:07.110
A second business use-case
for blockchain in

38
00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.010
the value exchange sphere,
is the marketplace.

39
00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:15.525
Blockchain marketplaces,
offer exchange of goods,

40
00:02:15.525 --> 00:02:18.490
services, and even jobs.

41
00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.570
Currently, these types of

42
00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.875
marketplaces face
challenges over trust,

43
00:02:24.875 --> 00:02:28.145
who is offering
the good services or job,

44
00:02:28.145 --> 00:02:31.630
and who is operating
the marketplace itself?

45
00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.585
Blockchain technology offers
a potential solution.

46
00:02:35.585 --> 00:02:39.260
It allows buyers and
sellers to transfer

47
00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.230
their reputation
from one marketplace

48
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.610
to another using
the distributed ledger.

49
00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.165
Another very significant
business use-case

50
00:02:50.165 --> 00:02:54.320
for blockchain in
value exchange, is energy.

51
00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.755
Blockchain energy companies are

52
00:02:57.755 --> 00:03:02.360
decentralized energy
data exchange platforms.

53
00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.355
In other words, they focus
on data related to energy.

54
00:03:07.355 --> 00:03:09.679
This may include, for example,

55
00:03:09.679 --> 00:03:14.224
what's known as smart grid
management or managing

56
00:03:14.224 --> 00:03:16.050
energy information through

57
00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.320
a highly technologized
smart grid.

58
00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.850
These companies provide
data transparency

59
00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:27.575
and integrity solutions
to the use of energy.

60
00:03:27.575 --> 00:03:30.859
In addition, blockchain
energy companies

61
00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:33.800
can potentially enable
the forecasting

62
00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.830
for these smart grids and provide

63
00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:40.400
for trading and investment
in the energy space.

64
00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.805
A second major component
of blockchain business

65
00:03:43.805 --> 00:03:47.510
use cases, is shared data.

66
00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.300
Some specific areas within

67
00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.310
shared data include
Internet of Things,

68
00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.720
supply chain or logistics,

69
00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.350
what's known as attribution
for collaboration,

70
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.902
reputation systems,

71
00:04:04.902 --> 00:04:08.735
and the management of
healthcare information.

72
00:04:08.735 --> 00:04:11.750
Internet of Things refers to how

73
00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.320
the myriad of devices
that we have today

74
00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.994
leverage the use of
data and the Internet

75
00:04:18.994 --> 00:04:23.890
to help us get things done
more quickly and effectively.

76
00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:27.945
The business use-case
of shared data,

77
00:04:27.945 --> 00:04:30.710
focuses on the Internet
of Things and

78
00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.790
combines it with the use
of blockchain technology.

79
00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.885
Here, blockchain can
potentially create secure

80
00:04:38.885 --> 00:04:43.670
and optimized IoT applications.

81
00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:46.449
These companies
leverage blockchain

82
00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:48.765
to change how our devices,

83
00:04:48.765 --> 00:04:50.570
such as mobile phones,

84
00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:52.605
communicate with each other.

85
00:04:52.605 --> 00:04:58.370
Today, both new and existing
companies operate within

86
00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.250
this area of
the blockchain ecosystem

87
00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:04.625
to focus on Internet of Things.

88
00:05:04.625 --> 00:05:07.370
Another business use case for

89
00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.234
the blockchain in
the shared data space,

90
00:05:10.234 --> 00:05:14.330
is in the supply chain
and logistics world.

91
00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.760
This area is ripe for

92
00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.360
disruption by
blockchain technology.

93
00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.065
Think of how supply
chain works today.

94
00:05:24.065 --> 00:05:27.725
Today, the supply chain
for any one product

95
00:05:27.725 --> 00:05:31.700
that you may buy can span
hundreds of different stages.

96
00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:34.760
Multiple geographies
as products move

97
00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.930
across the country and
even around the world.

98
00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.315
Invoices for different
components of production

99
00:05:41.315 --> 00:05:45.185
and payments from many different
entities take place.

100
00:05:45.185 --> 00:05:47.915
Thousands of individuals
may be involved,

101
00:05:47.915 --> 00:05:52.150
and the whole process is
very non-transparent.

102
00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.755
The use of blockchain technology

103
00:05:54.755 --> 00:05:57.220
can transform supply chain.

104
00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:01.730
Here, every transaction in
the supply chain can be

105
00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:03.770
recorded on a block and

106
00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:07.220
distributed across
many different nodes.

107
00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.865
Blockchain can
increase transparency

108
00:06:10.865 --> 00:06:13.355
and security of this process,

109
00:06:13.355 --> 00:06:18.145
and importantly, it is both
efficient and scalable.

110
00:06:18.145 --> 00:06:20.540
Examples of the types of

111
00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:23.690
supply chain or
logistic processes that

112
00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:25.280
can benefit from the use of

113
00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:29.450
blockchain technology include
the production of cars,

114
00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:32.705
the production and
distribution of food,

115
00:06:32.705 --> 00:06:36.835
and even the distribution
and sale of diamonds.

116
00:06:36.835 --> 00:06:40.430
Another exciting and
important business use-case

117
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:43.160
for blockchain in
the shared data space,

118
00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:47.165
is known as attribution
for collaboration.

119
00:06:47.165 --> 00:06:50.030
This sounds complicated,
but it simply

120
00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:53.300
refers to things like
music or writing,

121
00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:55.580
and having multiple entities work

122
00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:58.880
together to collaborate
on a project.

123
00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:02.390
Using blockchain,
artists can generate

124
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:06.185
immutable and timestamped titles.

125
00:07:06.185 --> 00:07:08.510
We can register assets to

126
00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:13.180
a blockchain network and
verify and authorize content.

127
00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:15.380
Blockchain can also be

128
00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:18.110
used to create terms
for licensing.

129
00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:20.870
Thus transforming the way we work

130
00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:24.620
together to create
songs or scripts.

131
00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:28.175
Another interesting
and exciting area

132
00:07:28.175 --> 00:07:31.910
of blockchain is
the reputation system.

133
00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:35.735
Reputation systems are
another great example

134
00:07:35.735 --> 00:07:39.980
of the use of shared data
as a business use case.

135
00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:42.635
Reputation systems address a risk

136
00:07:42.635 --> 00:07:44.855
known as counterparty risk.

137
00:07:44.855 --> 00:07:46.910
For example, if I'm

138
00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:49.295
conducting a transaction
with someone else,

139
00:07:49.295 --> 00:07:52.115
I face the risk that
that person won't fulfill

140
00:07:52.115 --> 00:07:55.415
their obligations under
that transaction.

141
00:07:55.415 --> 00:07:57.765
That is counterparty risk.

142
00:07:57.765 --> 00:08:01.555
So for example, if we're
lending money to one another,

143
00:08:01.555 --> 00:08:04.690
we face the risk
that party A might

144
00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:08.415
not lend the money or party
B might not pay it back.

145
00:08:08.415 --> 00:08:11.060
The blockchain can be used to

146
00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:13.790
create a reputation system that

147
00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:15.935
encourages and rewards

148
00:08:15.935 --> 00:08:19.805
accurate information
about those parties.

149
00:08:19.805 --> 00:08:22.490
Together, that data
can be used to

150
00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:25.355
create what's known as
a reputation score.

151
00:08:25.355 --> 00:08:29.780
Today, companies are using
the blockchain to create

152
00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:31.970
these reputation systems and

153
00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:35.210
leverage them within
their business community.

154
00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:39.845
Another very exciting potential
use for the blockchain

155
00:08:39.845 --> 00:08:44.480
within the shared data space
is healthcare information.

156
00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:47.810
Healthcare information
is another area

157
00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:50.240
that is ripe for disruption.

158
00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.580
Today, healthcare data is

159
00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:55.445
highly fragmented in
the United States.

160
00:08:55.445 --> 00:08:57.740
Our data spans across

161
00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:01.595
multiple entities,
hospitals, clinics,

162
00:09:01.595 --> 00:09:05.540
insurance providers, and it
can be difficult to both

163
00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:10.400
gather and provide that
information where it's necessary.

164
00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:14.975
Companies are working to
use the blockchain to allow

165
00:09:14.975 --> 00:09:16.970
individuals to own and

166
00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:20.285
control their own
healthcare information.

167
00:09:20.285 --> 00:09:24.649
Using blockchain technology,
patients can potentially

168
00:09:24.649 --> 00:09:26.990
decide who would get access to

169
00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:30.455
their information in
a secure fashion.

170
00:09:30.455 --> 00:09:34.865
For example, the data on
the blockchain could be used

171
00:09:34.865 --> 00:09:39.365
by patients to be sold to
a drug trial of their choice.

172
00:09:39.365 --> 00:09:43.085
In this way, the blockchain
can be used to transform

173
00:09:43.085 --> 00:09:44.990
the way we control and

174
00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:47.810
distribute our
healthcare information.

175
00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:50.900
Another very exciting area of

176
00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:54.920
business use cases is
known as authenticity.

177
00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:58.460
Authenticity within
the blockchain ecosystem,

178
00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:03.080
refers to the integrity
and validation of data.

179
00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:06.605
Within authenticity,
data and title

180
00:10:06.605 --> 00:10:09.905
is one very important
business use case.

181
00:10:09.905 --> 00:10:12.425
An example, real estate.

182
00:10:12.425 --> 00:10:14.930
Currently, we face problems with

183
00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:18.830
the data and storage of
real estate information.

184
00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:22.085
For example, title
is stored on paper,

185
00:10:22.085 --> 00:10:26.285
sometimes in a town or county
hall and it can take days,

186
00:10:26.285 --> 00:10:31.340
even weeks to trace the use
of a title over time.

187
00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:34.580
Blockchain can be
used to facilitate

188
00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:38.540
the storage and
the validation of this data.

189
00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:41.825
In addition, in
a real estate transaction,

190
00:10:41.825 --> 00:10:45.125
blockchain can be leveraged
to secure the integrity

191
00:10:45.125 --> 00:10:48.920
of the customer or
the buyer of an asset.

192
00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:53.090
Blockchain can also be used
to create an audit trail for

193
00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:55.790
certain business processes or

194
00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:59.645
create proof of an event
or a transaction.

195
00:10:59.645 --> 00:11:03.110
Another very exciting
potential use case for

196
00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:07.670
blockchain in the authenticity
space relates to ticketing.

197
00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:12.469
Today in the world of ticketing
for concerts or events,

198
00:11:12.469 --> 00:11:16.790
there can be problems related
to counterfeit tickets.

199
00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:20.000
Blockchain offers
a potential solution.

200
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.780
For example, using
blockchain technology,

201
00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:26.990
we can facilitate
the transfer of ownership of

202
00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:31.355
a ticket from one entity
or individual to another.

203
00:11:31.355 --> 00:11:34.384
In fact, tickets can be created

204
00:11:34.384 --> 00:11:37.700
and validated on
the blockchain itself,

205
00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:40.640
and blockchain registration can

206
00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:44.840
potentially prohibit
fraud in this process.

207
00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:48.920
Another very significant
business use case for

208
00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:53.225
blockchain is in
the diversified financial space.

209
00:11:53.225 --> 00:11:57.560
Here, we're referring to
blockchain companies within

210
00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:02.375
the ecosystem that perform
services related to legal,

211
00:12:02.375 --> 00:12:05.795
accounting, middle
and back office,

212
00:12:05.795 --> 00:12:09.815
and other types of
diversified financial services.

213
00:12:09.815 --> 00:12:12.950
A number of companies
are growing in

214
00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:16.460
the legal space in
business use cases.

215
00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:19.070
These blockchain
companies leverage

216
00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:23.255
smart contracts to
execute between parties.

217
00:12:23.255 --> 00:12:25.610
This offers an alternative to

218
00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:28.895
direct execution
of paper contracts

219
00:12:28.895 --> 00:12:31.280
between parties or entities,

220
00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:33.350
and it can mean,

221
00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:36.845
less involvement
by actual lawyers.

222
00:12:36.845 --> 00:12:39.860
In this space, the blockchain or

223
00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:43.505
smart contracts can be
used to secure property,

224
00:12:43.505 --> 00:12:48.155
intellectual property, and
even replace a notary public.

225
00:12:48.155 --> 00:12:52.895
Another very exciting business
use case for blockchain,

226
00:12:52.895 --> 00:12:55.220
is in the world of accounting.

227
00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:59.780
Blockchain can be used to
transform accounting itself,

228
00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:02.270
because the technology can

229
00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:06.155
constitute a new type
of accounting ledger.

230
00:13:06.155 --> 00:13:08.660
This ledger can result in

231
00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:12.440
continuous verification
and updating,

232
00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:18.245
unlike current paper heavy,
labor intensive processes.

233
00:13:18.245 --> 00:13:20.360
In addition, because of

234
00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:24.575
the secure and immutable nature
of blockchain technology,

235
00:13:24.575 --> 00:13:27.455
there may be a lower threat of

236
00:13:27.455 --> 00:13:31.490
alteration or corruption
of accounting records.

237
00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:35.779
Finally, the blockchain
business use cases

238
00:13:35.779 --> 00:13:40.415
related to diversified
financial can also transform

239
00:13:40.415 --> 00:13:42.844
middle and back office functions

240
00:13:42.844 --> 00:13:45.290
of many different types
of companies,

241
00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:49.400
and conduct processes
such as payroll,

242
00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:54.810
lending and trading, and even
maintain market analytics.
