00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:04.460
In the previous lecture,
I discussed Proof-of-Work and

2
00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.370
how it enabled randomness
in a decentralized way.

3
00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.890
But critical to Proof-of-Work
is the solving of a hash puzzle.

4
00:00:13.488 --> 00:00:18.660
This process enables randomness
only if no one node can accrue

5
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.630
enough power to monopolize the network.

6
00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.700
And it also means that Bitcoin
trading in its current implementation

7
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.230
is potentially slow and limited.

8
00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:32.090
So I'm going to discuss these issues and
at the end,

9
00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.172
I would discuss some broader
challenges and summarize the module.

10
00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.230
So here's the first challenge to
Proof-of-Work called the 51% Attack.

11
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.380
What if a node succeeds in gaining
a majority of the CPU power across all

12
00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.970
nodes?

13
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.890
This node would then be the first
to solve all the hash puzzles.

14
00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.240
And then this node could build
the longest chain in the blockchain.

15
00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.961
So this system would then revert
to being partially centralized.

16
00:00:57.961 --> 00:01:02.107
You could think about it a little bit like
James coin from the few lectures ago.

17
00:01:02.107 --> 00:01:03.900
So let's discuss the situation.

18
00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:09.580
First note that if a node were to
obtain a majority of CPU power it

19
00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.190
would have to act as
a benevolent dictator.

20
00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.513
Now, this may not be much comfort
to have a benevolent dictator, but

21
00:01:15.513 --> 00:01:18.686
let's foresee why it would have
to act as a benevolent dictator.

22
00:01:18.686 --> 00:01:25.528
The only possible reward to gaining CPU
power and to proposing blocks is bitcoins.

23
00:01:25.528 --> 00:01:30.324
Now, a malicious 51% attacker could
include lots of bitcoin payments to him or

24
00:01:30.324 --> 00:01:32.750
herself through their address.

25
00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.594
But actually, no other nodes would
let this attacker spend the coins, so

26
00:01:36.594 --> 00:01:38.331
it'd be a little bit pointless.

27
00:01:38.331 --> 00:01:41.947
So any 51% attack is limited
in its profitability,

28
00:01:41.947 --> 00:01:46.200
and this will already reduce
the incentives for such an attack.

29
00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.460
And key is the fact that any attacker
is going to have a very large incentive

30
00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.840
to maintain trading in bitcoins
because probably, this attacker

31
00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.370
has a lot of bitcoins through all
the block rewards received over time.

32
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:08.110
And that also disincentivizes this 51
is present attack in a broader sense.

33
00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.451
So we've already seen this in operation.

34
00:02:09.451 --> 00:02:14.426
In 2014, a mining pool came
close to the 51% mark and

35
00:02:14.426 --> 00:02:21.830
voluntarily kept their control at 39.9%
calling on others to do the same.

36
00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.290
So because the potential attackers
already have a stake in the system,

37
00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.300
if they are behaving in a self
interested way, they have the reasons to

38
00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:36.390
not only avoid the attack but avoid
the circumstances that lead to the attack.

39
00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.620
Thus, this is unlikely to occur.

40
00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.129
Now, a weaker version of
the 51% attack is what

41
00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:45.976
would happen if a small number of nodes
were to control all the mining power.

42
00:02:45.976 --> 00:02:50.030
As bitcoin mining has become
industrialized, this has been occurring.

43
00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.760
So it appears that mining
power is concentrated in

44
00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.580
perhaps a small number of nodes,
it's hard to say for sure.

45
00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.540
So here's a worry,
these miners could form a cartel.

46
00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.150
Now I'm not saying that the credit
card companies are like a cartel but

47
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.480
if they were, maybe the same thing could
happen to the small number of nodes.

48
00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.930
They could then charge high transaction
fees because transaction fees

49
00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.170
are as we discussed,
part of the reward for creating blocks.

50
00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.201
This is also like seigniorage,
which is essentially the tax

51
00:03:21.201 --> 00:03:25.797
from the sovereign to inflation
seigniorage, under another name.

52
00:03:25.797 --> 00:03:27.210
Could this occur?

53
00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:28.870
Yeah, it could occur.

54
00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.350
It hasn't yet occurred though,
and perhaps one reason for

55
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.360
that is that,
all involved have a stake, a very

56
00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.520
large stake perhaps in the continued
success of bitcoin as a currency.

57
00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.191
Okay, so, that's challenge one, the 51%
attack and related oligopoly power.

58
00:03:47.191 --> 00:03:52.397
It hasn't proven to be a big challenge
yet, we don't know for sure if it could

59
00:03:52.397 --> 00:03:57.220
become a big challenge but there
are reasons to suspect that it won't.

60
00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.610
So Proof-of-Work Challenge 2,
Resource Intensity.

61
00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.050
So bitcoin mining uses
lots of electricity.

62
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.640
Maybe uses too much electricity.

63
00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.880
Well actually, it doesn't use that much.

64
00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.432
At most at the moment,

65
00:04:13.432 --> 00:04:17.944
it uses only 6% of the energy used
in the global banking sector.

66
00:04:17.944 --> 00:04:23.640
And it's way, way, way tiny compared
to the energy use of total consumption.

67
00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:24.970
Now, why is this?

68
00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.760
Mining takes place where energy
is not a scarce resource, and

69
00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:28.890
it can continue to do so.

70
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.109
So, this is apparently a concern,
but it turns out not really.

71
00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.060
Now perhaps, one has a philosophical
concern regarding the energy use.

72
00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.850
Here's a green and
environmental critique of Bitcoin.

73
00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.097
It appears that miners are using
energy to basically solve a puzzle.

74
00:04:46.097 --> 00:04:48.570
Now that seems a little silly, right?

75
00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.200
I mean usually, if we're using energy,

76
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.930
we are hoping to create
something that people can use.

77
00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.010
But here,
all of this energy is going to waste,

78
00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.370
would go this critique because
it's all used for puzzle solving.

79
00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.380
So what's the point of that?

80
00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.048
It seems wasteful.

81
00:05:05.048 --> 00:05:07.330
Well, I think it depends
how you look at it.

82
00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.530
I don't agree with this critique.

83
00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.912
In fact,
Proof-of-Work does something useful.

84
00:05:11.912 --> 00:05:15.000
It's a technology that
enables trading in Bitcoin.

85
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.398
Now, trading in Bitcoin through
Proof-of-Work is implemented as

86
00:05:19.398 --> 00:05:20.623
a zero-sum game.

87
00:05:20.623 --> 00:05:24.262
But as long as one believes Bitcoin
is a net benefit to society,

88
00:05:24.262 --> 00:05:26.820
there is a net benefit
to society in mining.

89
00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.610
It really is producing something.

90
00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:29.880
What is it producing?

91
00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.540
Well, it's producing the working
of Bitcoin the system.

92
00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:36.960
So I don't think this concern is valid.

93
00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.130
Okay, so here's a third challenge.

94
00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:42.760
Can the network scale?

95
00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.710
So blocks are limited in size.

96
00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:48.480
Blocks are limited in how
quickly they can be created.

97
00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.720
And this puts pretty much a hard

98
00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.930
upper limit on the number of transactions
per second, and there are not very many.

99
00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:59.270
This is not seem sufficient to be
a large scale medium of exchange and

100
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:01.900
this would really cap bitcoins usefulness.

101
00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:06.020
This is really, I think the part
of Nouriel Roubini's critique

102
00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.370
in his congressional testimony
that carries the most weight.

103
00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:12.980
And it's safe to say that given
this problem achieving scale

104
00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:16.098
is the most discussed
issue in cryptocurrency.

105
00:06:16.098 --> 00:06:20.980
Blogs on cryptocurrency point
out the following trilemma,

106
00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:26.110
that blockchain systems can have at most
of the three, being decentralization,

107
00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:28.820
scalability, and security.

108
00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.901
But just by saying this trilemma,

109
00:06:30.901 --> 00:06:34.930
this trilemma doesn't mean that
it's an impossibility result.

110
00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:40.078
So just because within bitcoin,
there's no good answer to whether

111
00:06:40.078 --> 00:06:45.429
the network can scale, doesn't mean
that there won't be an answer.

112
00:06:45.429 --> 00:06:49.289
Ethereum, for example,
has a different version of Proof-of-Work.

113
00:06:49.289 --> 00:06:53.578
It uses many of the same underlying
principles that I just described, but

114
00:06:53.578 --> 00:06:55.591
it seems perhaps to scale better.

115
00:06:55.591 --> 00:07:00.510
I will now summarize the module and
then give some further thoughts.

116
00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:04.570
So Bitcoin, and perhaps other established
cryptocurrencies, create a system of

117
00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:10.000
property rights that does not depend on
enforcement by centralized authorities.

118
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.160
These property rights can span
jurisdictions, thus allowing for

119
00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:17.800
trades in ways that was previously
expensive or difficult, or illegal.

120
00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:23.630
Cryptocurrencies enable this feat
through technology, mathematics, and

121
00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:26.600
what I would call
philosophical innovation.

122
00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.640
Property rights need not
hold with certainty,

123
00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:31.510
it is sufficient that they
hold probabilistically.

124
00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:34.995
In this module, I discussed how
the digital signature, blockchain and

125
00:07:34.995 --> 00:07:40.140
Proof-of-Work enable these property
rights and hence, Bitcoin to operate.

126
00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:42.760
Now, some closing thoughts.

127
00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:44.030
In one of the previous lectures,

128
00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:48.180
I pointed out that a money system
is really a memory system.

129
00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:52.230
The Bitcoin system is a problem
of collective memory.

130
00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:56.760
So like any society, the Bitcoin society
relies on the truthfulness of this

131
00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:58.510
collective memory to function well.

132
00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:02.730
Is it possible to tamper
with collective memory?

133
00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:07.199
Yes, it can be given enough power and
a willingness of people to behave

134
00:08:07.199 --> 00:08:10.860
maliciously, collective
memory can be tampered with.

135
00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:12.602
And in the 20th century,

136
00:08:12.602 --> 00:08:17.425
actual collective memory has been
tampered with two disastrous effects.

137
00:08:17.425 --> 00:08:20.130
Think Stalin, or Hitler, or Mao.

138
00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:24.990
So Bitcoin like society
relies on this not happening.

139
00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:30.870
Now interestingly, Bitcoin is not
actually completely decentralized.

140
00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:36.810
It requires that nodes agree on
what's called the reference software.

141
00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:40.220
Now, when there is agreement about
what should be the reference software,

142
00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:42.590
something called a hard fork is created.

143
00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:46.510
So that's Bitcoin can flexibly
accommodate descent without a solution.

144
00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:51.788
But there does need to be widespread
agreement about what Bitcoin means.

145
00:08:51.788 --> 00:08:53.370
And there also must be some level

146
00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:58.410
of commitment to
the continuation of the network.

147
00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:02.740
In other words, malicious behavior for
its own sake could destroy Bitcoin.

148
00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:06.010
Thus, Bitcoin and cryptocurrency
is in general a vast experiment.

149
00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:11.815
We don't know exactly why Bitcoin works,
we only know that it does.
