00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:02.880
In the last module,

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.565
we explored why cryptocurrency
might be useful.

3
00:00:05.565 --> 00:00:08.160
Here we delve more deeply
into the rules and

4
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.265
structures that enable
bitcoin to operate.

5
00:00:11.265 --> 00:00:13.500
Note that blockchain was

6
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.735
the technological
innovation that allowed

7
00:00:15.735 --> 00:00:17.730
digital currencies
to take off when

8
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.655
previously so many had failed.

9
00:00:20.655 --> 00:00:23.840
Let's first take a little bit
of a trip through

10
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.455
the graveyard of
failed online currencies.

11
00:00:27.455 --> 00:00:30.505
Does anyone remember CyberCash?

12
00:00:30.505 --> 00:00:33.850
So CyberCash was
a company in the 1990s

13
00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.335
that pioneered an online
currency called CyberCoin.

14
00:00:38.335 --> 00:00:41.540
Now, one of the features
of CyberCoin is that

15
00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.010
every user needed to obtain

16
00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.470
a certificate to
verify their identity,

17
00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.695
and apparently nobody
really wanted to do this.

18
00:00:48.695 --> 00:00:53.330
So CyberCash eventually filed
for bankruptcy in 2001.

19
00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.320
The technology that was part
of CyberCash was eventually

20
00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.690
acquired through several steps

21
00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.660
by what is now known as PayPal.

22
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.740
Does anyone remember DigiCash?

23
00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.450
So DigiCash also had

24
00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.510
an online currency
called CyberBucks.

25
00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.490
Here clients were anonymous,

26
00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.930
so there was no cumbersome
verification system.

27
00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.445
So DigiCash patented
a blind signature scheme

28
00:01:21.445 --> 00:01:24.985
that has some similarity
to bitcoin's protocol.

29
00:01:24.985 --> 00:01:27.910
Now, there was a divide
between merchants and clients,

30
00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:29.380
which is very unlike bitcoin.

31
00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:30.820
Merchants were not anonymous,

32
00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.260
they needed to register
with the bank.

33
00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.650
So it was not cumbersome
for customers,

34
00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.745
but it was cumbersome
for merchants.

35
00:01:37.745 --> 00:01:40.455
There was no user-to-user
transactions.

36
00:01:40.455 --> 00:01:43.900
So CyberBucks failed when
merchants did not want to

37
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.950
register and then there were

38
00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.655
no clients that could
trade among themselves.

39
00:01:48.655 --> 00:01:52.190
DigiCash filed for
bankruptcy in 1998.

40
00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:53.750
The technology again through

41
00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.065
several steps was
acquired by InfoSpace.

42
00:01:57.065 --> 00:02:00.759
Now, the creators of DigiCash

43
00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:02.960
caused some consternation when

44
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.850
they patented the technology.

45
00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.500
So the mailing list, Cypherpunks,

46
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.700
which was a predecessor
of the mailing list

47
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.489
from which Satoshi Nakamoto,

48
00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:16.535
wrote some of
his earliest comments

49
00:02:16.535 --> 00:02:19.740
on what became bitcoin.

50
00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.870
The participants in
Cypherpunks decided that they

51
00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.160
wanted to create
a online currency.

52
00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.510
They weren't so worried
about the patent.

53
00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.285
They created something
called magic money.

54
00:02:32.285 --> 00:02:34.220
Another currency around this time

55
00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.510
was something called Lucre.

56
00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.265
Lucre was DigiCash,

57
00:02:37.265 --> 00:02:39.980
but with the attempt to
get around the patent.

58
00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.780
So neither of these were

59
00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.290
associated with for
profit companies,

60
00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.190
but we don't really think
about them anymore.

61
00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:47.570
It's safe to say,

62
00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.370
that these currencies
did not take off.

63
00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:50.690
So these are only four of

64
00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.290
many attempts to create
a digital currency.

65
00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.245
So enter Satoshi Nakamoto.

66
00:02:57.245 --> 00:03:00.720
In a bitcoin forum, he writes,

67
00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.040
''A lot of people automatically
dismiss e-currency as

68
00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.270
a lost cause because of

69
00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.015
all the companies that
failed since the 1990s.

70
00:03:08.015 --> 00:03:09.760
I hope it's obvious it was

71
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.320
essentially controlled nature of

72
00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.580
those systems that doomed them.''

73
00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.495
So what's interesting here,

74
00:03:15.495 --> 00:03:17.620
as we had a problem for
which there had been

75
00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.150
multiple attempts to solve
it and they'd all failed.

76
00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.460
That was probably
pretty discouraging

77
00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.799
for the participants involved,

78
00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:28.180
and of course, one
could draw the lesson

79
00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.530
of well if it's a hard problem,

80
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.030
keep working on it.

81
00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.665
But what's also interesting
is that sometimes there's

82
00:03:35.665 --> 00:03:37.120
insight from all of

83
00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.620
these failed attempts into
what specifically went wrong,

84
00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.345
and that seems to
be the case here.

85
00:03:43.345 --> 00:03:45.430
But actually let's discuss why

86
00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.275
this is such a hard problem.

87
00:03:47.275 --> 00:03:50.750
So if you have a truly
decentralized currency,

88
00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.050
what that decentralized
currency must

89
00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:56.035
achieve is a system
of ownership rights.

90
00:03:56.035 --> 00:03:57.490
That system has to be

91
00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:00.180
self-enforcing because it
can't rely on a state.

92
00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.020
We discussed this in
the previous lecture.

93
00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:04.345
There's no sovereign. There's
no police department.

94
00:04:04.345 --> 00:04:08.425
So this decentralized
currency must

95
00:04:08.425 --> 00:04:10.600
also maintain a ledger of

96
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.195
transactions that is
secure and accurate.

97
00:04:13.195 --> 00:04:16.330
This maintenance must
also be self-enforcing

98
00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:18.130
because there's no profit-making

99
00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:19.870
intermediary behind the scenes.

100
00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:20.880
In the last module,

101
00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.840
we also discussed the role

102
00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.160
of the centralized intermediary.

103
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.280
So we need to somehow
have a currency that

104
00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.485
avoids the sovereign and
the centralized intermediary.

105
00:04:30.485 --> 00:04:33.030
Now, if that were not enough,

106
00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.880
it also must maintain trading in

107
00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.115
the currency because
currencies do trade,

108
00:04:37.115 --> 00:04:38.420
and it has to have rules

109
00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:40.010
governing the supply
of the currency.

110
00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:41.450
So we need a sovereign,

111
00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.100
we need a centralized
intermediary,

112
00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:44.725
and we need a central bank.

113
00:04:44.725 --> 00:04:47.765
All of this has to
be decentralized.

114
00:04:47.765 --> 00:04:51.080
So it is a pretty
difficult problem.

115
00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.070
So I'm going to discuss in
this module how bitcoin meets

116
00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.925
these challenges using
cryptography and using blockchain.

117
00:04:58.925 --> 00:05:01.340
So here are the topics
that we will be covering.

118
00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.120
First, I will discuss
the digital signature,

119
00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.745
and then how bitcoin creates
a tamper-proof ledger.

120
00:05:08.745 --> 00:05:11.660
So these two points are important

121
00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.870
for the definition of property
rights within the system.

122
00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.030
They are not sufficient however.

123
00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:19.970
That ledger needs to be
maintained and updated.

124
00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:22.345
That's where blockchain comes in.

125
00:05:22.345 --> 00:05:27.675
But even blockchain is really
by itself not quite enough

126
00:05:27.675 --> 00:05:31.040
because of this notion of how

127
00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:34.280
do you decide what is
the correct set of transactions,

128
00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.105
that's where we need to talk
about distributed consensus.

129
00:05:37.105 --> 00:05:40.820
Finally, how does bitcoin
become a central bank,

130
00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.515
currency supply and trade,

131
00:05:42.515 --> 00:05:45.960
and then what are
some future challenges.
