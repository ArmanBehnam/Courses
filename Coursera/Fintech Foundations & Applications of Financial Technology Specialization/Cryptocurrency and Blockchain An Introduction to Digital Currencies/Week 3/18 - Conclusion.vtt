1
00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.470
So to summarize,
cryptocurrency is

2
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.410
a highly controversial and
very risky new asset class.

3
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.980
Now, the big question that
many focus on is will

4
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.955
cryptocurrency some day function
as a medium of exchange?

5
00:00:14.955 --> 00:00:17.910
But actually, that's
not quite right.

6
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.865
Here's a more nuanced
and correct version.

7
00:00:20.865 --> 00:00:23.220
Will enough people believe that

8
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.260
enough people believe that
enough people believe,

9
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.120
etc, that cryptocurrency will

10
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.850
someday function as a
medium of exchange?

11
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:31.290
If this is the case,

12
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:33.360
then beliefs can be
self-fulfilling,

13
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.200
and without cryptocurrency ever

14
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.770
really being a
medium of exchange,

15
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.745
it can function as
a store of value.

16
00:00:40.745 --> 00:00:43.970
Note however, that
the potential for

17
00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.345
multiple equilibria can
make prices unstable.

18
00:00:47.345 --> 00:00:50.675
So let's talk about
why people might think

19
00:00:50.675 --> 00:00:52.430
cryptocurrency could
be a medium of

20
00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.400
exchange because that's
the key to its value.

21
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.100
Cryptocurrency
detractors focus on

22
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.155
the disadvantages namely,

23
00:01:00.155 --> 00:01:02.060
relative to fiat money,

24
00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.040
cryptocurrency has no sovereign

25
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.400
to declare it as legal tender.

26
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.970
In fact, some sovereigns are
actively hostile to crypto.

27
00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.950
However, perhaps, the distributed
consensus that crypto

28
00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.025
brings is more trustworthy
than any single sovereign.

29
00:01:19.025 --> 00:01:21.265
That would be the advantage.

30
00:01:21.265 --> 00:01:23.390
Now, what are the main advances

31
00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.400
that has made crypto possible?

32
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.030
So many focus on the technological
advance of blockchain.

33
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.700
However, blockchain
is fundamentally and

34
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.095
advanced based on economics
not computer science.

35
00:01:35.095 --> 00:01:37.370
So the breakthrough
is one of an idea.

36
00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:38.540
The idea is that,

37
00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.105
rather than make
tampering impossible,

38
00:01:41.105 --> 00:01:45.545
create incentives so that
tampering is unprofitable.

39
00:01:45.545 --> 00:01:49.515
In fact, at all levels,
Bitcoin, for example,

40
00:01:49.515 --> 00:01:52.909
employs incentives
so that all players

41
00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:54.665
work for the good of the system

42
00:01:54.665 --> 00:01:57.125
as we discussed in
the second module.

43
00:01:57.125 --> 00:02:00.500
However, I would argue that
the main advance even goes

44
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.540
beyond this fundamental
change and understanding.

45
00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.481
Beyond incentives,

46
00:02:06.481 --> 00:02:09.395
crypto relies on
probabilistic thinking.

47
00:02:09.395 --> 00:02:12.990
So previously, the notion
of transaction validity,

48
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.710
say the non crypto world,

49
00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.750
requires a 100 percent certainty.

50
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.710
If you make a transaction
with your credit card,

51
00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:23.915
that transaction is verified

52
00:02:23.915 --> 00:02:25.705
with a 100 percent certainty,

53
00:02:25.705 --> 00:02:27.410
but crypto replaces this with

54
00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.215
near but not a 100
percent certainty.

55
00:02:30.215 --> 00:02:32.060
So thus, crypto creates

56
00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.745
probabilistic property rights
that are decentralized,

57
00:02:35.745 --> 00:02:39.095
and in some sense aversion
of probabilistic truth.

58
00:02:39.095 --> 00:02:42.080
So this requires a
new way of thinking.

59
00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.390
So it's not as if
you own something,

60
00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.945
you just you something with
near certain probability.

61
00:02:47.945 --> 00:02:50.270
So it's a really big change in

62
00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.790
the way we think about
property rights,

63
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.340
and the way we might
think about, say,

64
00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.015
transactions and how we
interact with each other.

65
00:02:59.015 --> 00:03:04.515
Now, how does this come into
valuation asset allocation?

66
00:03:04.515 --> 00:03:06.985
So in the 3th module,

67
00:03:06.985 --> 00:03:08.540
I made the point
that it's easy to

68
00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.835
argue based on
traditional finance,

69
00:03:10.835 --> 00:03:12.470
that the value of
cryptocurrencies

70
00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.780
should be exactly zero.

71
00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.130
They pay no dividends after
all and they're only cash.

72
00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:20.960
The traditional view of cash

73
00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.130
is that you should hold as little

74
00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.495
as possible just what you need
for transaction benefits.

75
00:03:25.495 --> 00:03:29.120
So likewise, it is
easy to argue based on

76
00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.400
traditional finance that
there's no room at all for

77
00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.490
cryptocurrency in an optimal
investment portfolio.

78
00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:36.590
I would say that
it's a little bit

79
00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.520
too easy to argue these things.

80
00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.650
On the other hand, if
you take the data on

81
00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.960
cryptocurrency returns
at face value,

82
00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.305
they look like they're a
pretty good investment.

83
00:03:48.305 --> 00:03:53.285
However, there are serious
problems with both views.

84
00:03:53.285 --> 00:03:56.809
So the traditional
finance view understates

85
00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:58.040
the importance of cash for

86
00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.635
transactions and as
a store of value.

87
00:04:00.635 --> 00:04:03.560
So a richer view could
allow for valuation

88
00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.755
of crypto based on
transaction advantages.

89
00:04:06.755 --> 00:04:09.380
On the other data side,

90
00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.330
crypto returns we have
to acknowledge our

91
00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.925
inflated by survivor bias.

92
00:04:13.925 --> 00:04:17.420
So how can we put all of
this together to build

93
00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.030
potentially a new finance view

94
00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:21.875
that would allow for crypto?

95
00:04:21.875 --> 00:04:23.600
One thing to keep in mind

96
00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.980
that's important
is that crypto is

97
00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:29.705
a natural hedging asset that
suggests certain advantages.

98
00:04:29.705 --> 00:04:31.760
So the times when people believed

99
00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.500
that crypto is going
to function as

100
00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.840
a medium of exchange
are likely to not

101
00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.855
be the most stable
states of the world.

102
00:04:38.855 --> 00:04:41.840
So this tells us a little
bit about what we might

103
00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.780
expect from investing in crypto.

104
00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.540
First of all, it's
going to be very

105
00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.010
volatile because of the potential

106
00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:50.645
for multiple equilibria,

107
00:04:50.645 --> 00:04:52.360
we're relying on the beliefs of

108
00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.120
everybody as opposed to
a stream of dividends.

109
00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.730
We also should think
about the returns

110
00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:00.340
as likely to not be very high.

111
00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.505
Even so far, on most days,

112
00:05:03.505 --> 00:05:08.600
one would lose money by
investing in ether or an ripple.

113
00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.990
But on a deeper level,

114
00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:12.910
if cryptocurrency
is a hedging assets

115
00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:14.740
the returns should be low.

116
00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.840
So the high average
returns that we've

117
00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.495
observed might be anomalous.

118
00:05:19.495 --> 00:05:21.625
But that's okay.

119
00:05:21.625 --> 00:05:23.070
A hedging asset can have

120
00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.160
lower returns because
you are using

121
00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.070
it because it pays

122
00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:29.995
off in not-so-good
states of the world.

123
00:05:29.995 --> 00:05:32.080
Now, based on what we've seen in

124
00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.180
the data and based
on this concept,

125
00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.760
one thing that we
might expect for

126
00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.520
cryptocurrency is when
we least expected,

127
00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.330
we might see some very
large positive surprises.

128
00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.190
Thank you all for coming on

129
00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:48.990
this cryptocurrency
journey with me.
