00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.240
Welcome to module three,

2
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.830
cryptocurrency as an asset class.

3
00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:08.605
So first I'm going to
introduce the module.

4
00:00:08.605 --> 00:00:10.570
Lecture two, we'll discuss risk

5
00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:12.635
and return to cryptocurrency.

6
00:00:12.635 --> 00:00:14.395
Lecture three, will be

7
00:00:14.395 --> 00:00:16.735
some background on
asset allocation.

8
00:00:16.735 --> 00:00:18.490
Finally lecture four, will be

9
00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.125
asset allocation
with cryptocurrency.

10
00:00:21.125 --> 00:00:23.320
So, does cryptocurrency have

11
00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.660
a place in the portfolio
of an investor?

12
00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.270
Can we use the concepts
we have developed in

13
00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.105
the previous modules to
answer this question?

14
00:00:31.105 --> 00:00:32.950
Now recall the reactions to

15
00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.375
cryptocurrency in
the first module.

16
00:00:35.375 --> 00:00:37.425
Jamie Dimond says. "A fraud,

17
00:00:37.425 --> 00:00:39.015
worse than tulip bulbs."

18
00:00:39.015 --> 00:00:42.495
Warren Buffett, says.
"Probably rat poison squared".

19
00:00:42.495 --> 00:00:44.060
"Crypto is the mother of

20
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.160
all scams and now
busted bubbles",

21
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.180
is from the title of

22
00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.810
Nouriel Roubini's
congressional testimony.

23
00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.130
So I'm going to
discuss two views of

24
00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.380
cryptocurrency as
part of a portfolio,

25
00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.945
both of them used
traditional finance.

26
00:00:56.945 --> 00:00:58.535
So what would be

27
00:00:58.535 --> 00:01:02.740
one traditional finance
view of cryptocurrency?

28
00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.950
Let's take the Capital
Asset Pricing Model,

29
00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.060
one of the great achievements
of finance and still

30
00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.180
the benchmark theory
for expected returns.

31
00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.910
According to the capital
asset pricing model,

32
00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.280
which I will discuss
further in lecture three,

33
00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.395
investors should hold
risky securities

34
00:01:18.395 --> 00:01:21.035
according to their
market weighted values.

35
00:01:21.035 --> 00:01:23.990
Now, the CAPM is
a pretty good witness

36
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.870
the success of index funds.

37
00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.650
In fact, you could
say that the CAPM

38
00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.185
really created index funds.

39
00:01:30.185 --> 00:01:33.215
What does the CAPM
say about crypto?

40
00:01:33.215 --> 00:01:35.420
Well, the most straightforward
interpretation is that

41
00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.165
one should hold
zero cryptocurrency.

42
00:01:38.165 --> 00:01:40.520
That's because cash or currency,

43
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.505
has transaction value
but isn't connected

44
00:01:43.505 --> 00:01:46.760
to some asset that
creates underlying value,

45
00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.085
there simply mediums of exchange.

46
00:01:49.085 --> 00:01:50.960
So the idea that the CAPM would

47
00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.610
have about really all currencies,

48
00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.980
that you really shouldn't
hold it in your portfolio,

49
00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.825
it's what we in economics call

50
00:01:56.825 --> 00:01:58.700
a zero net supply security.

51
00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.020
You really just should hold

52
00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.750
as little as possible
for transaction needs.

53
00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.360
That's a traditional view
coming from the CAPM.

54
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.070
Now a related idea is

55
00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.335
something called
the Gordon Growth Model.

56
00:02:09.335 --> 00:02:11.060
The Gordon Growth Model is

57
00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.430
a benchmark method for
value and companies.

58
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.080
What it does is it values

59
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.975
any asset based on
its cash flows,

60
00:02:17.975 --> 00:02:19.370
and you can connect it with

61
00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.145
the capital asset pricing model
but you don't need to.

62
00:02:22.145 --> 00:02:24.680
So one idea is that
perhaps one could value

63
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.170
cryptocurrency using
the Gordon Growth Model,

64
00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.890
and then you could decide is
Crypto over or under-valued.

65
00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.780
However, the Gordon Growth
Model values companies based

66
00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.010
on their dividends and obviously

67
00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.645
currency pays no dividends.

68
00:02:35.645 --> 00:02:38.090
We're going to discuss this
further in lecture four.

69
00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.030
So thus the Gordon Growth Model
and the CAPM are

70
00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.620
both in line with

71
00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.635
the views expressed at
the start of the lecture,

72
00:02:44.635 --> 00:02:47.445
cryptocurrency should
be worth zero.

73
00:02:47.445 --> 00:02:48.980
However, suppose we take

74
00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.175
a purely data-driven perspective.

75
00:02:52.175 --> 00:02:55.400
Let's construct returns
on cryptocurrency and

76
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.550
look at the empirical properties
of these returns.

77
00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.830
Let's treat these returns
as if they were returns

78
00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.200
on any traditional
investment and ask,

79
00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.600
if we saw an investment with
returns like these would

80
00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.225
we want to hold it as
part of our portfolio?

81
00:03:08.225 --> 00:03:11.065
That's what I'm going to
develop in lecture two.

82
00:03:11.065 --> 00:03:12.770
So both of these views

83
00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.690
are traditional
finance viewpoints,

84
00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.255
and we will see that they
are at odds with each other.

85
00:03:17.255 --> 00:03:19.430
Now they each have drawbacks.

86
00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.560
The first view that
I've described using

87
00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:22.790
the capital asset pricing model

88
00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:23.690
and the Gordon Growth Model,

89
00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.295
is a theory-driven view,

90
00:03:25.295 --> 00:03:26.780
and we might be missing something

91
00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.685
important in our assumptions.

92
00:03:28.685 --> 00:03:31.310
View two, is a purely
data-driven view,

93
00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.040
but there might be
serious limitations to the data.

94
00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.035
So we might ask, is
there a third view?

95
00:03:37.035 --> 00:03:40.810
Well, we'll return to
this a bit at the end.
