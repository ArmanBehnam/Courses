00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.540
In this lecture,
I'm going to review

2
00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.835
some concepts portfolio theory.

3
00:00:05.835 --> 00:00:07.815
Specifically, we're going to

4
00:00:07.815 --> 00:00:09.780
talk about the portfolio
theory developed

5
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.520
by Markowitz in 1952

6
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.755
for which he was awarded
the Nobel Prize.

7
00:00:13.755 --> 00:00:16.320
This is still the benchmark
portfolio theory

8
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.185
used in finance and taught
in finance classes.

9
00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:21.645
Now, it has require
an approximation.

10
00:00:21.645 --> 00:00:23.280
The approximation is that

11
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.515
returns are normally distributed.

12
00:00:25.515 --> 00:00:27.030
In the last lecture, we talked

13
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:28.575
about how cryptocurrency returns

14
00:00:28.575 --> 00:00:31.845
are definitely not
normally distributed.

15
00:00:31.845 --> 00:00:34.710
However, the most
important insight from

16
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.260
this theory that
there are gains from

17
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.385
diversification
transcends the assumption

18
00:00:40.385 --> 00:00:42.440
of normally distributed returns.

19
00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.660
It's just a little
more complicated to do

20
00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.570
this theory when returns are
not normally distributed.

21
00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.310
I will then review the main
consequence of this theory,

22
00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:52.520
which is the capital
asset pricing model.

23
00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.200
So both are going to be very

24
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.810
useful in the results
that follow.

25
00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.080
So here are the assumptions
of portfolio theory.

26
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.365
The first is that investors
prefer more to less,

27
00:01:03.365 --> 00:01:05.210
the second is that investors are

28
00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.250
risk averse, and finally,

29
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:08.915
strictly speaking, we do assume

30
00:01:08.915 --> 00:01:11.215
the normal distribution
for returns.

31
00:01:11.215 --> 00:01:14.060
Now, what this gives
us is that investors

32
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.680
care about the mean and

33
00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.705
the standard deviation
of returns,

34
00:01:17.705 --> 00:01:20.720
but they don't care about
higher order moments.

35
00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.020
So what we want to
think about are

36
00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.035
the trade-offs between means
and standard deviations,

37
00:01:26.035 --> 00:01:27.850
and our basic tool
for thinking about

38
00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.495
this trade-off is the mean
standard deviation diagram.

39
00:01:31.495 --> 00:01:34.015
So consider this diagram,

40
00:01:34.015 --> 00:01:35.795
there are two assets;

41
00:01:35.795 --> 00:01:38.280
asset A and asset B.

42
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.505
Asset A and asset B are on
the same horizontal line.

43
00:01:42.505 --> 00:01:43.840
That means that they have

44
00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.620
the same expected return
or the same mean return.

45
00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.425
However, notice that asset A

46
00:01:50.425 --> 00:01:53.425
is plotted more to the
left than asset B.

47
00:01:53.425 --> 00:01:54.820
That means that A has

48
00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.135
a lower standard deviation
than asset B.

49
00:01:58.135 --> 00:02:01.030
Now, we said that investors

50
00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.560
prefer more to less
and are risk averse.

51
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.480
So A has the same mean as B,

52
00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.750
but A has a lower
standard deviation.

53
00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.660
What that means is
that A dominates B.

54
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.760
So according to our assumptions,

55
00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.410
which is investors
prefer more to less,

56
00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.200
they are risk averse and we
have a normal distribution,

57
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.740
every investor will
like A over B.

58
00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.090
We don't really need
to know anything

59
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.230
else about their preferences.

60
00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.595
So we say A dominates B.

61
00:02:26.595 --> 00:02:28.520
Now, consider A and

62
00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.050
C. A and C are on
the same vertical line,

63
00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.235
but on different
horizontal lines.

64
00:02:34.235 --> 00:02:36.020
This means, A and C have

65
00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.700
the same standard
deviation namely;

66
00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.395
the same level of risk,

67
00:02:39.395 --> 00:02:42.385
but A has a higher
expected return.

68
00:02:42.385 --> 00:02:45.165
So A dominates C. Again,

69
00:02:45.165 --> 00:02:47.060
we don't need to
know anything about

70
00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.950
investor preferences
other than what we

71
00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.560
specified to say that
every investor is going to

72
00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.590
prefer A to C. Now,

73
00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.355
let's consider A,
B, and C together.

74
00:02:57.355 --> 00:03:00.460
So if we compare B and C,

75
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.425
we will see that neither
dominates the other.

76
00:03:03.425 --> 00:03:05.270
Some investors will prefer

77
00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.040
B and some investors will prefer

78
00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.370
C. An investor who
cares more about risks,

79
00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.935
or is more risk
averse, will prefer C,

80
00:03:12.935 --> 00:03:14.480
but the problem is, this investor

81
00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.355
is going to get a lower return.

82
00:03:16.355 --> 00:03:19.670
So the investor who prefers
B is still risk averse,

83
00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.560
but can tolerate more risk,

84
00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.165
that investor will be

85
00:03:23.165 --> 00:03:26.650
rewarded with
a higher expected return.

86
00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.660
Now, Markowitz showed that

87
00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.165
if we take all the risky assets,

88
00:03:32.165 --> 00:03:36.575
these lie inside of
what is a sideways U.

89
00:03:36.575 --> 00:03:41.365
This sideways U is called
the risky asset frontier.

90
00:03:41.365 --> 00:03:45.725
His point is that by combining
risky assets cleverly,

91
00:03:45.725 --> 00:03:48.095
you can get to the top
part of the frontier,

92
00:03:48.095 --> 00:03:50.660
that's called the efficient
frontier where you get

93
00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.290
the best trade-off
between risk and return.

94
00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:59.000
So let's think about the mean
standard deviation diagram.

95
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.075
Here we have the mean,

96
00:04:02.075 --> 00:04:06.635
and here we have sigma for
the standard deviation.

97
00:04:06.635 --> 00:04:09.445
So here's what Markowitz showed.

98
00:04:09.445 --> 00:04:13.684
If you take a whole bunch
of risky assets,

99
00:04:13.684 --> 00:04:18.215
each of these dots
represent a risky asset.

100
00:04:18.215 --> 00:04:22.420
So notice that they are over
here there not over here,

101
00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.234
which means that the
standard deviation is positive,

102
00:04:25.234 --> 00:04:27.170
they have all different
standard deviations

103
00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:28.430
and all different means.

104
00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.105
Now, what you can
do is you can ask,

105
00:04:31.105 --> 00:04:36.480
what is the lowest
standard deviation for any mean?

106
00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.110
Now, if you ask that,

107
00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.270
the answer to
that question traces

108
00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:45.025
out a curve that looks like this.

109
00:04:45.025 --> 00:04:48.600
So we can say all
right here's a mean,

110
00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.960
what's the lowest possible
standard deviation?

111
00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.340
It's this point right here.

112
00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.240
Well, here's a mean,

113
00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.855
what's the lowest possible
standard deviation?

114
00:05:00.855 --> 00:05:02.610
Well, it's this point right here.

115
00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.330
So this curve here is called

116
00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:16.770
the minimum variance frontier.

117
00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.570
Now, what's a frontier?

118
00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:20.760
A frontier is the
farthest you could go,

119
00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.970
like the Western frontier or
space the final frontier.

120
00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:27.555
Well, here, notice
there's nothing beyond

121
00:05:27.555 --> 00:05:30.205
the minimum variance frontier

122
00:05:30.205 --> 00:05:33.800
all the portfolios are
within the frontier.

123
00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.965
Now, there's a special
part of the frontier.

124
00:05:36.965 --> 00:05:39.820
This part, that's where
investors want to be,

125
00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:41.795
because there's a higher mean

126
00:05:41.795 --> 00:05:43.470
given the standard deviation,

127
00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:48.865
and that part is called
the efficient frontier.

128
00:05:48.865 --> 00:05:51.635
Now, we're still talking
about the case where there's

129
00:05:51.635 --> 00:05:55.400
risky assets and
no riskless asset.

130
00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.520
So what we're going to do
next is see what happens when

131
00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.820
we add in something like

132
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.685
a treasury bill represented by

133
00:06:04.685 --> 00:06:09.570
a point on the y-axis,
the risk-free rate.

134
00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:12.860
Now let's introduce
a riskless asset

135
00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:14.735
like a treasury bill.

136
00:06:14.735 --> 00:06:18.905
The tangency line from the
riskless asset to the frontier

137
00:06:18.905 --> 00:06:22.580
tells you the best possible
risky asset portfolio.

138
00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:25.205
So consider this following graph.

139
00:06:25.205 --> 00:06:28.010
So here we see mean on

140
00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:32.120
the y-axis and standard
deviation on the x-axis.

141
00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.150
We see the sideways U that

142
00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.840
represents the frontier
of all the risky assets.

143
00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:42.530
So all the risky assets lie
inside of the frontier and

144
00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:46.280
the frontier represents
the minimum standard deviation

145
00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.245
you can get for each mean.

146
00:06:48.245 --> 00:06:51.199
Now, we put on the y-axis,

147
00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:52.580
the risk-free rate and we draw

148
00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:56.425
a tangency from the risk-free
rate to the frontier.

149
00:06:56.425 --> 00:06:59.150
That tangency hits
the frontier at

150
00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:00.590
one by definition and

151
00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:02.255
that point we're
going to call it M,

152
00:07:02.255 --> 00:07:04.655
we can call it M for mutual fund.

153
00:07:04.655 --> 00:07:08.630
Now notice, that that line,

154
00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:13.160
the line connecting
the risk-free rate to M that's

155
00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.699
tangent to the risky
asset frontier

156
00:07:16.699 --> 00:07:20.750
dominates every other
point in the space.

157
00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:23.390
So for every point in the space

158
00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:26.585
or however you much
risk you want,

159
00:07:26.585 --> 00:07:28.535
you want to be on that line,

160
00:07:28.535 --> 00:07:29.840
and that is the result for which

161
00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:32.275
Markowitz won the Nobel Prize.

162
00:07:32.275 --> 00:07:34.680
So the tangency portfolio,

163
00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:36.600
the M, what's so
special about it?

164
00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:40.355
Well, it has the
highest possible slope.

165
00:07:40.355 --> 00:07:42.020
Any portfolio that has

166
00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:45.065
a lower slope will be
sub-optimal, namely;

167
00:07:45.065 --> 00:07:47.810
you can get a better mean for

168
00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:49.340
the same level of risk by

169
00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:51.875
going to the tangency
portfolio line.

170
00:07:51.875 --> 00:07:55.490
Now, portfolios with a higher
slope would be wonderful,

171
00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:58.040
but they cannot be
attained because you

172
00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:01.160
need some connection to
the risky asset frontier.

173
00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:04.250
So this slope, which is
the expected return minus

174
00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:05.600
the risk-free rate divided by

175
00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.190
the standard
deviation, has a name.

176
00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:10.190
It's called the Sharpe
ratio after Bill Sharpe,

177
00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:11.960
whom we're going to
discuss in a moment.

178
00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:13.820
Now the line from
the risk-free rate to

179
00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:15.140
the tangency portfolio is

180
00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:17.360
called the capital
allocation line.

181
00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:20.270
Just to review what makes
the capital allocation line so

182
00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:22.070
special is its the line that

183
00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:24.565
has the highest Sharpe ratio.

184
00:08:24.565 --> 00:08:27.200
So the consequence
of this is something

185
00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.975
called the mutual fund theorem.

186
00:08:29.975 --> 00:08:32.960
What it means is that
the portfolio allocation problem

187
00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:35.090
can be divided into two parts.

188
00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:37.940
The first part is the same
for any investor and it

189
00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:40.910
says you should determine
the tangency portfolio.

190
00:08:40.910 --> 00:08:43.595
It's the optimal combination
of risky assets,

191
00:08:43.595 --> 00:08:45.265
it's the mutual fund.

192
00:08:45.265 --> 00:08:48.410
Then you determine based
on how risk averse you

193
00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:51.635
are where you want to be on
the capital allocation line.

194
00:08:51.635 --> 00:08:53.630
So if you're very risk averse,

195
00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:55.310
you want to hold a little bit of

196
00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:59.960
the mutual fund and a lot
of the risk-free asset.

197
00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:02.350
If you're not as risk averse,

198
00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:03.950
you might want to put
all your wealth in

199
00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:07.025
the mutual fund then you'll
be at the tangency part.

200
00:09:07.025 --> 00:09:09.650
If you're not that
risk averse at all,

201
00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:11.330
you might even want to borrow and

202
00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:13.865
invest the proceeds
in the mutual fund.

203
00:09:13.865 --> 00:09:16.325
So that's the mutual
fund theorem.

204
00:09:16.325 --> 00:09:19.715
Now, Bill Sharpe in the 1960s

205
00:09:19.715 --> 00:09:21.410
realized an amazing consequence

206
00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:23.240
of the mutual fund theorem.

207
00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:25.760
If all investors hold

208
00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:29.825
the same risky asset portfolio
than the market portfolio,

209
00:09:29.825 --> 00:09:32.480
which is the weighted average
of everyone's portfolio,

210
00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:35.540
is the best possible
portfolio, namely;

211
00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:37.790
the market portfolio
is the tangency and

212
00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:40.835
the market portfolio is
the efficient portfolio.

213
00:09:40.835 --> 00:09:43.580
So in other words, you
don't even need to do

214
00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:46.085
statistical analysis
to find the tangency,

215
00:09:46.085 --> 00:09:48.080
you can find the tangency just by

216
00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:50.600
looking at the market weights of

217
00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:52.460
all assets relying on

218
00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:56.225
the wisdom of crowds to have
found the tangency for you.

219
00:09:56.225 --> 00:09:58.910
So what are the consequences
of this insight,

220
00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:01.790
which is called the capital
asset pricing model?

221
00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:05.450
Well, the first is that
the market portfolio,

222
00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:06.560
the portfolio that holds

223
00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:08.150
assets according to
their market weights,

224
00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:10.460
is an efficient
portfolio, namely;

225
00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:12.200
all investors should combine

226
00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:14.450
the market portfolio
and the risk-free rate.

227
00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:16.340
The second closely
related is that

228
00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:17.540
the market portfolio has

229
00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:20.070
the highest Sharpe
ratio possible.

230
00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:23.245
Finally, and not so obviously,

231
00:10:23.245 --> 00:10:25.795
but this would be taught
in a finance class,

232
00:10:25.795 --> 00:10:28.710
expected returns on
assets are determined

233
00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:32.570
by their betas with respect
to the market portfolio,

234
00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:34.970
and they're determined by
the following equation

235
00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:37.175
which is called the
security market line.

236
00:10:37.175 --> 00:10:41.540
The expected return on
any asset is equal to

237
00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:44.270
the risk-free rate
plus the beta times

238
00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:46.220
the difference between
the expected return

239
00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:48.470
on the market portfolio
on the risk-free rate.

240
00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:50.060
Now, what's the beta?

241
00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:52.340
The beta is the covariance
of the asset with

242
00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:56.000
the market divided by
the variance of the market.

243
00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.265
So where we're going with this

244
00:10:58.265 --> 00:11:00.244
is we're going to
use these concepts

245
00:11:00.244 --> 00:11:02.000
to describe how crypto

246
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.400
my function as part of
an optimal portfolio.
