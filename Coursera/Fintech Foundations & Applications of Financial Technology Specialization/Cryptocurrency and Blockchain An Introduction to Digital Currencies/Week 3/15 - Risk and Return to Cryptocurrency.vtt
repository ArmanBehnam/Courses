00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.180
In this lecture, I will take

2
00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:05.625
a data driven approach
to cryptocurrency.

3
00:00:05.625 --> 00:00:08.160
First, we'll look at
basic price patterns.

4
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.780
Then, I'm going to define

5
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.715
the return to
investing in crypto.

6
00:00:11.715 --> 00:00:13.080
Will ask, what is

7
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.315
the average return to
investing in crypto?

8
00:00:15.315 --> 00:00:17.430
Then, what are the risks?

9
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.130
First, let's look at
a chart of the dollar to

10
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.140
Bitcoin exchange rate basically
starting back from 2014.

11
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.920
The orange line shows
how the price of

12
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.905
one Bitcoin varies
in terms of dollars.

13
00:00:30.905 --> 00:00:33.259
The blue line shows the volume,

14
00:00:33.259 --> 00:00:35.930
the transaction
volume in Bitcoin.

15
00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.320
So what we can see
from this chart is

16
00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.780
that Bitcoin has obviously

17
00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.780
increased substantially
since its very beginning.

18
00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.040
We can see the rise
of the end of 2017,

19
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.710
beginning of 2018 and

20
00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.845
the subsequent crash
at the start of 2018.

21
00:00:54.845 --> 00:00:58.385
But we also see that Bitcoin
has stabilized.

22
00:00:58.385 --> 00:01:00.310
So at the time of this recording,

23
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.555
it's $4,000 to one Bitcoin.

24
00:01:03.555 --> 00:01:05.475
Notice how the price of

25
00:01:05.475 --> 00:01:08.585
Bitcoin tracks the
volume pretty closely.

26
00:01:08.585 --> 00:01:11.600
You can also look
at the number of

27
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.220
active addresses of
Bitcoin which is

28
00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.650
some measure of how it's used.

29
00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.070
What's interesting about
active addresses is that

30
00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.280
they in some ways actually
predict the price of Bitcoin.

31
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.175
So active addresses
started to go up

32
00:01:25.175 --> 00:01:29.225
way before the price
of bitcoin went up.

33
00:01:29.225 --> 00:01:31.085
This is an interesting fact that

34
00:01:31.085 --> 00:01:34.505
perhaps could be used
in evaluation model.

35
00:01:34.505 --> 00:01:37.580
So here's the same
charts for Ether.

36
00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.730
So we see that Ether
also experienced a

37
00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:45.515
run-up then a crash and it
has subsequently stabilized.

38
00:01:45.515 --> 00:01:47.150
We also find the value of

39
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.615
the transactions in Ether
have continued to increase.

40
00:01:50.615 --> 00:01:55.490
Here's Ether along with
its active addresses.

41
00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.330
We see that active addresses
and Ether seemed to be going

42
00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.250
down but they're still far
above what they used to be.

43
00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.730
This act of address measure
is useful because it

44
00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:09.170
tells us something
about the number of

45
00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.180
people who are using the coin.

46
00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.670
Once somebody has established
an active address,

47
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.140
we might argue that they're
likely to stay with it,

48
00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.590
at least some of them.
Now, here's Ripple.

49
00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.990
Ripple is even more dramatic in

50
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.810
terms of an enormous
run-up then a crash.

51
00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.000
We also see that the volume in

52
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.160
Ripple and the active addresses

53
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.200
in Ripple have
however stabilized.

54
00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.355
Here's a graph of
the log of the prices.

55
00:02:37.355 --> 00:02:39.380
This is nice because we
can see all the prices

56
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.215
together on one graph if we
put them in a log scale.

57
00:02:42.215 --> 00:02:44.930
What that does is it
shrinks the outliers.

58
00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.895
So we can see that
the currencies all,

59
00:02:47.895 --> 00:02:52.545
more or less rose
together with Ethereum,

60
00:02:52.545 --> 00:02:54.500
I mean Ether, Ethereum
being the platform,

61
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:55.700
with Ether and Ripple

62
00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.270
leading Bitcoin which
was interesting.

63
00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.895
Then, they sold off together
but they did stabilize.

64
00:03:01.895 --> 00:03:05.045
We're going to talk about
this incredible price increase

65
00:03:05.045 --> 00:03:08.120
in Ripple later in this lecture.

66
00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.880
So just to summarize,
from these simple plots,

67
00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.140
we see that currency prices have

68
00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.280
stabilized at the time
of this recording,

69
00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.460
following the crash
from early 2018.

70
00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.925
We see that prices track volume

71
00:03:19.925 --> 00:03:22.625
and that they also
track active addresses.

72
00:03:22.625 --> 00:03:24.770
We see that active addresses
appear to have

73
00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:27.500
stabilized which is
something we might expect.

74
00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.410
We see that currency
prices for these three are

75
00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.750
very high relative
to where they began.

76
00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.430
However, we also know that

77
00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.015
many cryptocurrencies
have failed.

78
00:03:37.015 --> 00:03:40.820
Now, cryptocurrency is
a store of value and as such,

79
00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.980
we can think of it as an asset.

80
00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.410
So we're going to
refer to the price of

81
00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:46.670
Bitcoin as the number of dollars

82
00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:47.780
it takes to buy one Bitcoin.

83
00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.915
So the price of Bitcoin
right now is about 4,000.

84
00:03:50.915 --> 00:03:52.445
So now let's consider

85
00:03:52.445 --> 00:03:54.140
the returns to
the following strategy.

86
00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.405
Purchase one Bitcoin today,

87
00:03:56.405 --> 00:03:58.895
tomorrow exchange
that Bitcoin for dollars.

88
00:03:58.895 --> 00:04:01.160
We're going to ask, what is
the return on this strategy?

89
00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.650
Off course, this strategy will

90
00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.070
entail transaction costs
if taken literally.

91
00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:08.810
So perhaps it was better to think

92
00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.779
about what you would
get if you would sell,

93
00:04:11.779 --> 00:04:15.379
but it's perhaps best not
to trade cryptocurrency

94
00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:16.895
on a daily basis unless one has

95
00:04:16.895 --> 00:04:19.595
a very efficient platform
with which to do it.

96
00:04:19.595 --> 00:04:22.265
So what are these
returns look like?

97
00:04:22.265 --> 00:04:24.415
So let's just get
some notation clear.

98
00:04:24.415 --> 00:04:26.375
With $1, you can purchase

99
00:04:26.375 --> 00:04:29.195
one divided by Pt
units of Bitcoin

100
00:04:29.195 --> 00:04:30.830
where Pt is the price of Bitcoin

101
00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.405
today at time t. That's
what the t subscript means.

102
00:04:34.405 --> 00:04:36.600
So wait, why? Let's
just be clear.

103
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.310
With Pt, you can purchase

104
00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.010
Pt times 1 over Pt
units of Bitcoin.

105
00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.900
So with Pt, you can purchase
one unit of Bitcoin.

106
00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.555
So let's go back.

107
00:04:46.555 --> 00:04:49.370
With $1, you purchase 1
over Pt units of Bitcoin.

108
00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:50.840
So let's say you do this.

109
00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.355
Now, you wake up tomorrow,

110
00:04:52.355 --> 00:04:53.495
you look at Coinbase,

111
00:04:53.495 --> 00:04:55.175
how much is the Bitcoin worth?

112
00:04:55.175 --> 00:04:58.370
In your account a 1 over
Pt units of Bitcoin.

113
00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.835
Each are worth Pt plus 1.

114
00:05:00.835 --> 00:05:02.910
That's the price today,

115
00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.015
one day after you purchase them.

116
00:05:05.015 --> 00:05:06.610
So the daily return,

117
00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.255
using the Bitcoin symbol,

118
00:05:08.255 --> 00:05:10.970
is Pt plus 1 divided by Pt minus

119
00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:14.420
1 or the percent change in price.

120
00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:18.665
That's the definition of return
on the Bitcoin strategy.

121
00:05:18.665 --> 00:05:21.140
So it's the growth rate
of your investment.

122
00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:22.790
For example, if the price

123
00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:24.440
of Bitcoin went up
by three percent,

124
00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.479
which would be
an incredible daily return,

125
00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:28.780
we can plug in three percent.

126
00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.310
So Pt plus 1 over Pt is 1.03.

127
00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:35.400
That means the return is 0.03.

128
00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.339
Now, we can repeat this exercise

129
00:05:37.339 --> 00:05:39.065
with any of the cryptocurrencies.

130
00:05:39.065 --> 00:05:41.520
So this is our
definition of return.

131
00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:42.650
It's the rate of growth in

132
00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:45.185
your investment measured
in terms of dollars.

133
00:05:45.185 --> 00:05:46.730
Now, let's ask, what is

134
00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:50.225
the daily return over the sample
for each cryptocurrency?

135
00:05:50.225 --> 00:05:52.385
Well, here are the answers.

136
00:05:52.385 --> 00:05:58.630
For Bitcoin, the average return
per day is 0.254 percent.

137
00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:00.110
That means on average,

138
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:04.600
$1 invested in Bitcoin
became 1.0254.

139
00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.950
For Ether, it's 0.584 percent,

140
00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:11.310
and for Ripple,
it's 0.514 percent.

141
00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:14.930
Now, here's an important piece

142
00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:16.400
of information to
keep in mind when you

143
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.515
think about those returns.

144
00:06:18.515 --> 00:06:23.180
What I reported are statistical
averages known as means.

145
00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:24.920
How are they calculated?

146
00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.230
What I did was I summed up

147
00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:27.640
the daily returns and divided

148
00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.365
by the length of the sample.

149
00:06:29.365 --> 00:06:31.750
So that's what
statistics tells us is

150
00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:34.510
the best measure of
what you can expect.

151
00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:37.810
However, what's very interesting
about cryptocurrency is

152
00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:39.820
your returns on
a day-to-day basis

153
00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:41.890
might look very different.

154
00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:45.820
So what your returns on
a day-to-day basis look like,

155
00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:49.660
that's best described by
the daily median return.

156
00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:51.490
Now, in all cases,

157
00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:54.640
the median return lies well
below the mean return.

158
00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:58.920
So for Bitcoin,
it's 0.183 percent.

159
00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:03.195
For Ether, it's
minus 0.092 percent,

160
00:07:03.195 --> 00:07:05.685
way below the mean return.

161
00:07:05.685 --> 00:07:07.970
For Ripple, it's
even further below

162
00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:10.820
the mean return, minus 0.278.

163
00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:14.495
What that means is
that on most days,

164
00:07:14.495 --> 00:07:17.650
you would have lost money
on Ether and Ripple.

165
00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:19.485
Now, in technical terms,

166
00:07:19.485 --> 00:07:21.475
when the median lies
below the mean,

167
00:07:21.475 --> 00:07:23.540
what it means is that
cryptocurrency returns

168
00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:25.175
are positively skewed.

169
00:07:25.175 --> 00:07:26.870
Most of the time you lose

170
00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:28.940
money or you don't
make much money,

171
00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:32.975
but you make it up on
some really big outliers.

172
00:07:32.975 --> 00:07:34.595
Let's for example take

173
00:07:34.595 --> 00:07:36.725
the return distribution
for Ripple.

174
00:07:36.725 --> 00:07:38.750
Notice, so what
I've shown here is

175
00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:40.640
a histogram and notice
that I've had to

176
00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:43.850
break the histogram at
the middle and report in

177
00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:45.170
two different scales
because there's

178
00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:47.935
some really wild
returns on Ripple.

179
00:07:47.935 --> 00:07:50.010
Here's another graph that shows

180
00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:53.255
you what these wild
returns look like.

181
00:07:53.255 --> 00:07:56.795
So what this histogram
shows is only the tail.

182
00:07:56.795 --> 00:07:58.535
So what you see in the picture,

183
00:07:58.535 --> 00:08:01.040
the little picture, is
the full distribution.

184
00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:04.490
What this reveals
is that there was

185
00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:08.855
a day in Ripple where you
more than doubled your money,

186
00:08:08.855 --> 00:08:13.810
you earned a return of
160 percent in a single day.

187
00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:16.230
Now, if a return is normally

188
00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:19.160
distributed, volatility
measures risk.

189
00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.170
For example, returns on

190
00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:23.015
Ripple have a
standard deviation of

191
00:08:23.015 --> 00:08:28.135
8.78 percent per day and a mean
of 0.52 percent per day.

192
00:08:28.135 --> 00:08:31.185
So if Ripple returns were
normally distributed,

193
00:08:31.185 --> 00:08:33.650
95 percent of the returns
would fall between

194
00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:36.620
two standard deviations
above and below the mean.

195
00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:40.174
Namely, if you compute
the two standard deviations,

196
00:08:40.174 --> 00:08:42.625
18 percent and minus 17 percent.

197
00:08:42.625 --> 00:08:45.890
Now, that's a huge amount
of daily volatility.

198
00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:48.050
However, the normal
distribution does

199
00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:50.015
not describe Ripple very well.

200
00:08:50.015 --> 00:08:52.160
So here's the histogram with

201
00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.335
a normal distribution
plotted in front of it.

202
00:08:54.335 --> 00:08:56.960
We see that actually
most of the time

203
00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:00.559
Ripple returns lie well within
the normal distribution,

204
00:09:00.559 --> 00:09:01.940
which is to say that

205
00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:05.180
that daily volatility is
a little bit misleading.

206
00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:07.175
In fact, your volatility

207
00:09:07.175 --> 00:09:10.680
is lower than that
most of the time.

208
00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:13.550
However, we compute
such a high daily volatility

209
00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:15.230
because of the outliers.

210
00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:17.860
So you can see that the red line,

211
00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:19.635
which corresponds to
the normal distribution,

212
00:09:19.635 --> 00:09:21.890
completely leaves out both the

213
00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:25.925
negative and the
positive outliers for Ripple.

214
00:09:25.925 --> 00:09:28.190
A normal distribution
should say that

215
00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:30.895
a return of 160 percent,

216
00:09:30.895 --> 00:09:33.590
well technically possible, should

217
00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:36.440
never occur in the entire
history of the universe.

218
00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.675
But in fact, they did happen.

219
00:09:38.675 --> 00:09:40.250
So here's some caveats.

220
00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:41.450
This discussion does not assume

221
00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:44.090
transaction costs which
could be substantial.

222
00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:46.170
So for example, a $10 purchase of

223
00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:49.425
Bitcoin on Coinbase yields
about 850 worth of the coin,

224
00:09:49.425 --> 00:09:51.800
one could probably easily
improve on that though.

225
00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:55.070
Another caveat is
survivor bias because one way

226
00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:56.390
around the transaction costs is

227
00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:58.745
maybe don't transact
quite so frequently.

228
00:09:58.745 --> 00:10:01.910
Now, to illustrate
a survivor bias,

229
00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:03.785
let's think of
a really simple problem.

230
00:10:03.785 --> 00:10:07.310
Let's take 100 coins and
flip each of them 10 times.

231
00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:09.875
Here's a histogram that
describes the number of heads.

232
00:10:09.875 --> 00:10:12.050
I just tried this
on the computer off

233
00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:14.640
course and then just
computed one histogram.

234
00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:15.860
If you did this a
second time, you might

235
00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:17.675
get a slightly
different histogram.

236
00:10:17.675 --> 00:10:19.460
Now, suppose I look only at

237
00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:21.595
the number of heads
for the top three.

238
00:10:21.595 --> 00:10:23.860
They are eight, eight, and 10.

239
00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:26.780
Now, should I conclude
from looking at

240
00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:28.820
the top three coins that

241
00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:31.280
flipping a coin almost
always yields heads?

242
00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:33.335
Of course not. It's
just an artifact.

243
00:10:33.335 --> 00:10:35.540
I just decided to
pick the top three.

244
00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:37.370
So one criticism is that

245
00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:39.380
the focus on
three cryptocurrencies,

246
00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:41.000
the three that have done well,

247
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.910
has the same problem.

248
00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:46.350
So the prices of cryptocurrency,

249
00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:48.225
to summarize, appear
to have stabilized.

250
00:10:48.225 --> 00:10:49.380
Active addresses have grown,

251
00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:51.260
and prices seem to
rise with them.

252
00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.000
The top three cryptocurrencies

253
00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.605
have positive mean returns,

254
00:10:54.605 --> 00:10:57.025
but Ripple and Ether
have negative medians,

255
00:10:57.025 --> 00:10:59.250
which means most days
you would lose money,

256
00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:01.010
but there are positive outliers.

257
00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:04.490
Finally, returns are
subject to survivor bias.

258
00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:07.070
We really need to keep in
mind that we're looking at

259
00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:11.095
the three survivors whereas
many coins have failed.

260
00:11:11.095 --> 00:11:12.920
What this means is that

261
00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:15.170
the returns are going
to be inflated,

262
00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:18.720
though it's a little bit
unclear by how much.
