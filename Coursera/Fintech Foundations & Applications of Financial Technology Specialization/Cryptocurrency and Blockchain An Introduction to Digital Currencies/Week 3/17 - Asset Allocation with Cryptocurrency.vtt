00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.195
So in this lecture,

2
00:00:03.195 --> 00:00:05.700
I will discuss how one
might want to think about

3
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.200
cryptocurrencies possible place
in an optimal portfolio.

4
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.820
So in the introduction,

5
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.025
I laid out two traditional
finance views.

6
00:00:14.025 --> 00:00:17.490
One was more theoretical,
one empirical.

7
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.580
The theoretical view
is very simple,

8
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.800
and corresponds to some
of the quotes that I

9
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.680
mentioned at the beginning
of this set of lectures.

10
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.470
Because cryptocurrency
has no intrinsic value

11
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.510
and pays no dividends,

12
00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.715
it should not be part of
the optimal portfolio period.

13
00:00:32.715 --> 00:00:35.535
Here, I'm going to develop
the empirical view.

14
00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:37.365
So in Lecture 2,

15
00:00:37.365 --> 00:00:41.385
we saw that cryptocurrency
has high average returns.

16
00:00:41.385 --> 00:00:42.890
However, we saw that

17
00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.060
the standard deviation on

18
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.420
those returns is also very high.

19
00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.535
We found that returns
are positively skewed.

20
00:00:49.535 --> 00:00:52.100
Now another fact about
cryptocurrency is

21
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.650
that they have
relatively low Betas.

22
00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.300
So now we're going to use

23
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.490
these statistical results
and combine them with

24
00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:59.960
the portfolio theory to think

25
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.405
about crypto as an asset class.

26
00:01:02.405 --> 00:01:05.060
So one way to adjust
for the risk of

27
00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:06.410
the portfolio is to use

28
00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.149
something called
the Sharpe ratio,

29
00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:10.910
which is something that I
introduced in the last lecture.

30
00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:12.200
It's named for Bill Sharpe,

31
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.280
the Nobel Prize winning

32
00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.190
economist and
inventor of the CAPM.

33
00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.680
Now, the Sharpe ratio

34
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.630
is the slope of
the capital allocation line.

35
00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.270
So what does that mean?
Well, is the expected return

36
00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:24.860
minus the risk-free rate divided

37
00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.750
by the standard
deviation of return.

38
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.395
What it does is it tells you
the extra return you receive

39
00:01:30.395 --> 00:01:34.295
for the asset per unit
of standard deviation.

40
00:01:34.295 --> 00:01:37.085
So it's telling you how good is

41
00:01:37.085 --> 00:01:40.640
the risk return trade
off of this asset.

42
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.979
So now we're going to
use the statistics

43
00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:44.270
that I showed you last time to

44
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.650
compute the Sharpe ratio on

45
00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.005
the three major cryptocurrencies.

46
00:01:48.005 --> 00:01:50.330
Now, because these
are daily returns,

47
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.544
and because the interest rate
is basically zero anyway,

48
00:01:53.544 --> 00:01:56.015
we will use a risk-free
rate of zero.

49
00:01:56.015 --> 00:01:58.850
Thus, we'll compute
the expected return

50
00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.055
divided by the
standard deviation.

51
00:02:01.055 --> 00:02:06.270
Now recall that these returns

52
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.550
tell you a percent gain on

53
00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.070
a strategy that exchanges
dollars for cryptocurrency,

54
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.545
and then converts this
cryptocurrency back to dollar.

55
00:02:12.545 --> 00:02:14.750
It does assume no trading costs.

56
00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.895
Now, it's going to
use average returns.

57
00:02:16.895 --> 00:02:18.350
So on most days,

58
00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.390
you will lose money perhaps

59
00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.520
even if the Sharpe ratio
is positive,

60
00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.040
and then a big worry
is the survivor bias.

61
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.690
We are looking at the three best
cryptocurrencies.

62
00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.000
Just by definition, they're
going to represent the ones

63
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.840
that have ex-post,
the highest returns.

64
00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.315
Okay. So with all
of those caveats,

65
00:02:38.315 --> 00:02:40.435
let's look at some Sharpe ratios.

66
00:02:40.435 --> 00:02:44.540
So on Bitcoin, the average
daily return is 0.2 percent,

67
00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.495
whereas the standard deviation
is 4.3 percent,

68
00:02:47.495 --> 00:02:52.580
giving us a daily Sharpe ratio
on Bitcoin of 0.06.

69
00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.220
On Ether, the average
return is about

70
00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.880
0.6 percent and a standard
deviation of 7.2 percent,

71
00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.140
giving us a Sharpe ratio of 0.08.

72
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.440
On Ripple, the average
daily return is

73
00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.570
0.5 percent with a standard
deviation of 8.8 percent,

74
00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:12.110
giving us a Sharpe ratio of 0.06,

75
00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.120
about the same as Bitcoin.

76
00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.780
Now, as a comparison,

77
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.460
the Sharpe ratio on
the S&P 500 is 0.056.

78
00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:23.030
So Bitcoin and Ripple have

79
00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.615
about the same Sharpe ratio
as the S&P 500,

80
00:03:26.615 --> 00:03:29.540
and Ether has a slightly
higher Sharpe ratio.

81
00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.700
So if we are going to base

82
00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.310
our asset allocation on the
Sharpe ratio comparison,

83
00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:35.510
I would say this argues

84
00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.725
against investing
in cryptocurrency.

85
00:03:38.725 --> 00:03:40.580
So whereas it's true that

86
00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.970
these cryptocurrency
returns are high,

87
00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.600
if we look at the risk,

88
00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:49.640
the return per unit standard
deviation is not very high.

89
00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.440
So once we take issues of

90
00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.125
survivor bias and trading
costs into account,

91
00:03:54.125 --> 00:03:55.760
the Sharpe ratio analysis

92
00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.355
argues against investing
in cryptocurrency.

93
00:03:58.355 --> 00:04:02.170
Now, remember as we
discussed in the last class,

94
00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.360
we might expect based on
the capital asset pricing model

95
00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.190
for the market portfolio to have

96
00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.325
the highest Sharpe ratio anyway.

97
00:04:09.325 --> 00:04:12.855
In fact, we do see that
compared to cryptocurrency,

98
00:04:12.855 --> 00:04:17.595
the Sharpe ratio on the S&P
500 does not look so bad,

99
00:04:17.595 --> 00:04:20.570
and basically reflects
the fact that the S&P

100
00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.125
500 offers a very good
risk return trade off.

101
00:04:24.125 --> 00:04:27.650
So if we're going to base
the analysis on Sharpe ratio,

102
00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.770
perhaps we should not
invest in cryptocurrency.

103
00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.590
I would argue though that
we don't want to base

104
00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.240
the analysis on the
Sharpe ratio comparison.

105
00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.990
Instead, we want to
use another measure.

106
00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:40.970
We should use the Alpha.

107
00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.805
What is the Alpha on an asset?

108
00:04:43.805 --> 00:04:47.860
Alpha measures something
called the abnormal return.

109
00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.870
To understand abnormal return,

110
00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.300
we need to think about
the capital asset pricing model,

111
00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.455
which was introduced
in the last lecture.

112
00:04:54.455 --> 00:04:56.330
The capital asset
pricing model is

113
00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.915
the most popular theory
in financial markets.

114
00:04:58.915 --> 00:05:02.180
What does it says, is that
for any asset with return R,

115
00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:03.710
the expected return on the asset

116
00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.570
equals the risk-free rate plus

117
00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:09.260
the Beta multiplied by
the market risk premium,

118
00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:10.520
namely the expected return on

119
00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.770
the market minus
the risk-free rate.

120
00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.270
For the risk-free, rate you could

121
00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:15.860
take the treasury bill return.

122
00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.290
The market is the return on
the aggregate stock market.

123
00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:20.330
We can consider the S&P 500.

124
00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.390
The Beta is the covariance of

125
00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:26.930
the market with R divided by
the variance of the market.

126
00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.150
In short, the Beta
measures how much

127
00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.700
an asset moves
when the market moves.

128
00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:34.640
Now, the way we can
measure the Beta is

129
00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:37.160
by taking a scatter plot of

130
00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:38.930
the returns on say

131
00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:42.200
Ripple's cryptocurrency
or any cryptocurrency

132
00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.280
and on the market.

133
00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.430
So here's a scatter plot
where we have points that

134
00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:50.275
correspond to daily returns
on the S&P 500 and on Ripple.

135
00:05:50.275 --> 00:05:52.485
Ripple returns on the y-axis,

136
00:05:52.485 --> 00:05:54.860
S&P 500 returns on the x-axis.

137
00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:57.860
We can see the enormous one-day

138
00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.935
Ripple return that we
discussed in Lecture 2.

139
00:06:00.935 --> 00:06:06.695
Based on this, we can see
that there really is not that

140
00:06:06.695 --> 00:06:09.170
much of a relation between

141
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:13.085
market returns and
Ripple returns.

142
00:06:13.085 --> 00:06:16.660
Mainly, it's one big cloud.

143
00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:19.810
So now let's talk
about the Alpha.

144
00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:23.014
So the Alpha is
the part of the return

145
00:06:23.014 --> 00:06:26.075
that the Capital Asset Pricing
Model does not explain.

146
00:06:26.075 --> 00:06:28.550
That's why we call it
the abnormal returns.

147
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:29.735
So we take the return that

148
00:06:29.735 --> 00:06:31.820
would be expected return and we

149
00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:34.100
subtract the part of
the return that we

150
00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:36.500
would expect from
the Capital Asset Pricing Model,

151
00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:37.985
that's the normal return.

152
00:06:37.985 --> 00:06:40.820
Now, according to
the Capital Asset Pricing Model,

153
00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:43.100
namely if the theory is true,

154
00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:45.875
all Alphas should be zero.

155
00:06:45.875 --> 00:06:48.050
So in any one sample,

156
00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:51.380
we might measure
a positive Alpha but that

157
00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:55.175
should simply be statistical
noise or survivor bias.

158
00:06:55.175 --> 00:06:58.010
So recall the traditional view
that I mentioned before.

159
00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:00.005
According to the Capital
Asset Pricing Model,

160
00:07:00.005 --> 00:07:03.605
cryptocurrency has no place
in the optimal portfolio.

161
00:07:03.605 --> 00:07:07.205
But let's take
a purely statistical view.

162
00:07:07.205 --> 00:07:11.450
These cryptocurrencies actually
do have positive Alphas.

163
00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:13.805
They do exhibit abnormal returns

164
00:07:13.805 --> 00:07:16.130
on Bitcoin at 0.24 percent,

165
00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:18.290
on Ether at 0.57 percent,

166
00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:21.275
and on Ripple as 0.50 percent.

167
00:07:21.275 --> 00:07:24.830
So these Alphas, these daily
Alphas are actually pretty

168
00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:29.645
high compared to other strategies
that investors pursue.

169
00:07:29.645 --> 00:07:31.685
So which measure should we use?

170
00:07:31.685 --> 00:07:33.035
Alpha or Sharpe ratio?

171
00:07:33.035 --> 00:07:34.655
It makes a difference.

172
00:07:34.655 --> 00:07:37.250
Crypto looks better as an
asset class if we think in

173
00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:39.995
terms of Alpha and I would
argue Alpha is better.

174
00:07:39.995 --> 00:07:41.855
Now, why is Alpha better?

175
00:07:41.855 --> 00:07:44.090
Recall Portfolio Theory.

176
00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:47.150
What portfolio theory
says is that

177
00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:51.425
investors should seek out
the highest Sharpe ratio.

178
00:07:51.425 --> 00:07:54.575
But the highest
Sharpe ratio of what?

179
00:07:54.575 --> 00:07:58.535
The highest Sharpe ratio
of the total portfolio.

180
00:07:58.535 --> 00:07:59.900
The Sharpe ratio is

181
00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:01.070
an intuitive measure of

182
00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:03.620
the trade-off between
risk and return.

183
00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:07.070
It's tempting to use
it for any assets.

184
00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:09.500
But it is not
the most useful measure

185
00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:12.095
when applied asset by asset,

186
00:08:12.095 --> 00:08:14.420
because it does not
take into account

187
00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:18.155
covariance whereas Alpha does.

188
00:08:18.155 --> 00:08:21.080
Crypto, as we saw
with the Ripple plot,

189
00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:24.125
has a low covariance
with the market,

190
00:08:24.125 --> 00:08:25.910
and that makes the returns

191
00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:27.320
more impressive because it can be

192
00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:31.430
used to diversify
the market portfolio.

193
00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:33.185
So in other words,

194
00:08:33.185 --> 00:08:35.885
if we're talking about
a specific asset,

195
00:08:35.885 --> 00:08:38.150
we don't want to look at
the Sharpe ratio which

196
00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:40.475
is the measure for
the overall portfolio,

197
00:08:40.475 --> 00:08:42.530
we want to look at the Alpha.

198
00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:45.109
Now, these are closely related,

199
00:08:45.109 --> 00:08:47.615
because if you have

200
00:08:47.615 --> 00:08:50.600
a high Sharpe ratio portfolio
and if you include

201
00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.765
an asset that has a positive
Alpha in that portfolio,

202
00:08:53.765 --> 00:08:55.370
what that does is it

203
00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:57.665
pushes the investment
opportunity set

204
00:08:57.665 --> 00:09:03.035
outward and increases the slope
as shown in this diagram.

205
00:09:03.035 --> 00:09:06.710
So in other words,
the two measures are linked.

206
00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:11.390
What you want is the highest
Sharpe ratio portfolio.

207
00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:12.695
How do you get there?

208
00:09:12.695 --> 00:09:14.270
Well, if you have you start with

209
00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:16.040
the highest Sharpe
ratio portfolio you can

210
00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:18.260
find and then if you

211
00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.795
include an asset that
has a positive Alpha,

212
00:09:20.795 --> 00:09:23.270
what that asset does is it will

213
00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:25.850
make your Sharpe ratio
even higher.

214
00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:28.190
So by this discussion,

215
00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:30.680
what should happen is that if you

216
00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:34.145
include cryptocurrency
along with the S&P 500,

217
00:09:34.145 --> 00:09:35.840
you can actually get

218
00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:38.750
a higher Sharpe ratio portfolio

219
00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:41.420
by combining these
cleverly together.

220
00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:43.010
Now, caveats.

221
00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:44.990
It is certainly not
the purpose of this lecture to

222
00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:46.880
advocate for investing
in cryptocurrency,

223
00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:48.020
these are just principles for

224
00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:49.610
how to think about the problem.

225
00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:52.160
Survivor bias, transaction costs,

226
00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:53.960
and risk measurement especially

227
00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:56.000
due to the short sample all might

228
00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.680
argue against investing and

229
00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:00.125
taking these expected
returns seriously.

230
00:10:00.125 --> 00:10:03.275
So let's go back to
this issue of covariance.

231
00:10:03.275 --> 00:10:04.790
We see that the return on

232
00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:08.450
the top three cryptocurrencies
has been high.

233
00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:10.940
Now, this may in part reflect

234
00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:13.234
a resolution of the risk
of these currencies,

235
00:10:13.234 --> 00:10:14.630
so in that sense they might be

236
00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:16.595
unlikely to be
repeated, who knows?

237
00:10:16.595 --> 00:10:18.260
But they're still risky.

238
00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:22.190
So there may still be more high
expected returns to come.

239
00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:23.960
But it's hard to measure

240
00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:25.955
expected returns
in a small sample.

241
00:10:25.955 --> 00:10:29.375
Perhaps, we've mismeasured
the expected returns.

242
00:10:29.375 --> 00:10:33.590
However, the covariance
with the market and the

243
00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:37.715
associated Beta is less
likely to be mismeasured.

244
00:10:37.715 --> 00:10:41.330
So the Beta on
cryptocurrencies is about 0.5,

245
00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:43.125
it's not very high.

246
00:10:43.125 --> 00:10:45.500
This Beta is important;

247
00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:49.535
if the Beta is low and
0.5 is a pretty low Beta,

248
00:10:49.535 --> 00:10:53.240
then cryptocurrency
has value as a hedge.

249
00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:56.930
So how can we think
about this Beta?

250
00:10:56.930 --> 00:11:00.755
Well, if we want to really
get to what's driving Beta,

251
00:11:00.755 --> 00:11:02.120
we have to think
about what's driving

252
00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:04.340
the price of cryptocurrency.

253
00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:07.400
So let's for a moment
go with a substance,

254
00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:09.710
a simpler and more
basic benchmark theory

255
00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:11.795
called the Gordon Growth Model.

256
00:11:11.795 --> 00:11:14.435
What the Gordon growth
model says is that,

257
00:11:14.435 --> 00:11:16.220
if an asset pays
dividends that grow

258
00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:18.830
every year at rate g,

259
00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:21.905
and the expected return
on the asset is r,

260
00:11:21.905 --> 00:11:24.620
then the price of
the asset if we take

261
00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:27.740
next years dividend D,
is very simple.

262
00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:29.630
It's D divided by r minus g.

263
00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:32.270
This comes from
an infinite series formula.

264
00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:36.515
Now, strictly speaking,
according to this formula,

265
00:11:36.515 --> 00:11:40.295
crypto's price should be
zero all of the time,

266
00:11:40.295 --> 00:11:43.070
because there's no dividends
to cryptocurrency.

267
00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:45.605
That's the theoretical view
I mentioned before.

268
00:11:45.605 --> 00:11:50.150
However, if Bitcoin
might be useful

269
00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:52.535
someday as a medium of exchange,

270
00:11:52.535 --> 00:11:53.900
then maybe we can think about

271
00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:55.715
the dividend a little
bit differently.

272
00:11:55.715 --> 00:11:59.645
The dividend reflects
the convenience of exchange.

273
00:11:59.645 --> 00:12:02.570
Now, this is not
such a crazy concept.

274
00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:05.765
For example, it is
typical to have

275
00:12:05.765 --> 00:12:08.795
a bank account even
though the rate

276
00:12:08.795 --> 00:12:11.060
paid by a bank is often

277
00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:13.970
below that of
the treasury bill rate and

278
00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:17.330
the treasury bill rate itself
is often below the rate

279
00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:21.515
paid on say AAA corporate bonds
which are very safe.

280
00:12:21.515 --> 00:12:26.645
So it's pretty well
established empirically,

281
00:12:26.645 --> 00:12:27.950
that there's something called

282
00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:31.925
a convenience yield
for cash-like assets.

283
00:12:31.925 --> 00:12:37.520
So one way to think about
this dividend is it's

284
00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:40.250
a convenience yield
should Bitcoin

285
00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:43.895
ever become a cash-like asset.

286
00:12:43.895 --> 00:12:45.350
So if this is the case,

287
00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:46.580
what does the pricing formula

288
00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:48.740
tells us about the covariance?

289
00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:52.010
Well, there are
two offsetting effects.

290
00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:55.760
On the one hand,
the greater economic activity,

291
00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:57.830
the greater the demand
for cash of

292
00:12:57.830 --> 00:13:01.160
all kinds and thus the
greater demand for currency.

293
00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:03.830
Also, both cryptocurrency and

294
00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:05.060
the aggregate market depend

295
00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:07.595
positively on
technological innovation.

296
00:13:07.595 --> 00:13:09.140
Both of these would argue for

297
00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:12.290
positive covariance
and high Betas.

298
00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:13.970
The better the economy does,

299
00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:17.420
the more demand there is likely
to be for cryptocurrency,

300
00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:18.980
and the more likely
crypto will be

301
00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:20.975
used as a medium of exchange.

302
00:13:20.975 --> 00:13:23.150
This should drive up the price.

303
00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:24.860
On the other hand,

304
00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:26.870
when is it likely
that cryptocurrency

305
00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:29.345
would become a medium
of exchange?

306
00:13:29.345 --> 00:13:31.730
Related, when might people really

307
00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:34.790
consider cryptocurrency
as a store of value?

308
00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:37.790
I would argue that the times
when those things might

309
00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:41.630
occur are likely to be times
that are not very good.

310
00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:44.840
They might be times
of disruption,

311
00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:46.640
times of high risk,

312
00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:48.950
times when governments
are not reliable,

313
00:13:48.950 --> 00:13:50.870
namely bad economic times

314
00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:52.445
when the market is doing poorly.

315
00:13:52.445 --> 00:13:53.660
This is going to be what

316
00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:56.270
pushes the covariance
and the Beta

317
00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:58.220
lower thus it is likely that

318
00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:01.565
a Beta of 0.5 reflects
these two forces.

319
00:14:01.565 --> 00:14:04.460
What it means is that
cryptocurrency possibly has

320
00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:07.625
a role on a portfolio
as a hedging security.

321
00:14:07.625 --> 00:14:10.400
Thus to conclude,
cryptocurrency returns

322
00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:13.385
implies Sharpe ratios close
to those of the market.

323
00:14:13.385 --> 00:14:16.535
They have positive Alphas,
abnormal returns,

324
00:14:16.535 --> 00:14:18.200
which suggests that they
are good investment.

325
00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:21.365
No, this does not take into
account survivor bias.

326
00:14:21.365 --> 00:14:23.210
Now, the traditional theory says,

327
00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:25.070
do not hold cryptocurrency
no matter what,

328
00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:26.240
it pays no dividends, it has

329
00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:28.295
no role in the market portfolio.

330
00:14:28.295 --> 00:14:29.960
But traditional theory says,

331
00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:31.955
don't hold money of any kind.

332
00:14:31.955 --> 00:14:34.820
So crypto's role
as a hedge against

333
00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:38.195
bad economic times makes it
intriguing as an investment.

334
00:14:38.195 --> 00:14:40.790
But what's needed is
a quantitative theory of

335
00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:44.400
cryptocurrency to take
this into account.
