00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.110
So what is the
traditional argument for

2
00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.140
how artificial
intelligence can provide

3
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.630
value in areas that have been

4
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.260
traditionally occupied
by human intelligence,

5
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.585
for example, general
decision-making?

6
00:00:15.585 --> 00:00:19.170
Well, the first thing is
lower cost and the ability to

7
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.355
operate at scale and
operate efficiently.

8
00:00:23.355 --> 00:00:26.250
For example, well-known human

9
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.745
biases that include
order effects.

10
00:00:29.745 --> 00:00:33.290
In other words, humans make
different decisions for

11
00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.180
the same challenges or

12
00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.420
questions based on the order
which they see them,

13
00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.690
effects related to time
of the day or mood.

14
00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.675
The impact of
individual experiences.

15
00:00:44.675 --> 00:00:46.880
For example, a doctor gets

16
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.205
into a crash on
the way to the office.

17
00:00:49.205 --> 00:00:51.080
It turns out that can
affect decision-making.

18
00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.200
Well, algorithms ostensibly not

19
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.780
only allow scale and speed,

20
00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.305
but it regularity that would

21
00:01:00.305 --> 00:01:03.380
otherwise not necessarily be

22
00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.405
in place for
human decision-making.

23
00:01:05.405 --> 00:01:09.545
Machines may not be only less
error prone than humans,

24
00:01:09.545 --> 00:01:11.540
but could do all of
the above faster,

25
00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.555
and again at greater scale.

26
00:01:13.555 --> 00:01:15.120
Another fascinating area

27
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.030
where artificial intelligence has

28
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.445
seen success and use cases is
automated customer support.

29
00:01:22.445 --> 00:01:24.140
Some of you might have
had the experience

30
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.730
in which either through a chatbot

31
00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.325
online or even
speaking on the phone,

32
00:01:29.325 --> 00:01:34.100
you've encountered
algorithmic counterparts or

33
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.510
decision trees that
appear to take

34
00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.665
a human character when
you interact with them.

35
00:01:39.665 --> 00:01:45.425
Having a personal touch or
the ability to be relatable.

36
00:01:45.425 --> 00:01:47.600
It's clear to see how this
might lower cost because

37
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.695
the marginal cost of an
algorithm might be nearly zero,

38
00:01:50.695 --> 00:01:52.850
whereas the marginal
cost of a person

39
00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.445
maybe related to wages,

40
00:01:55.445 --> 00:01:57.560
and benefits and so on.

41
00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.790
In addition 24-7 availability
may alter the case

42
00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:07.690
for algorithms in customer
support for the rest of time.

43
00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.130
Now, there are
some controversies.

44
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.810
Clearly, we see in

45
00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.465
the robo advisory
industry applications

46
00:02:14.465 --> 00:02:16.850
involving AI and a future for AI.

47
00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.695
However, it's not so clear

48
00:02:18.695 --> 00:02:21.440
exactly what the role
will be in equilibrium,

49
00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.390
and in fact, if whether
the equilibrium is

50
00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.730
stable or constant at all.

51
00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.190
There have been some
who have suggested that

52
00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.710
the entire investment
advisor industry will move

53
00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:33.860
away from humanity and
toward algorithms,

54
00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.350
interaction with chatbots
or robo advisors,

55
00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.180
and ultimately
disintermediate humanity.

56
00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.840
In part due to

57
00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.290
legal and compliance issues
however, at least currently,

58
00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.780
it's unlikely in
the near term that

59
00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.810
acute computer can be
or will be held to

60
00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.720
a fiduciary standard
which is required in

61
00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.780
most countries including
the US by laws.

62
00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.340
For example, the Investment
Advisors Act of 1940 requires

63
00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.560
a fiduciary duty or

64
00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.410
the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act,

65
00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.310
ERISA which governs
pension related activities and

66
00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.330
some cases requires
a fiduciary duty,

67
00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.810
which is not clear
algorithms can arise to.

68
00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.800
This controversial area
will certainly be

69
00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.110
addressed in
the next several years.
