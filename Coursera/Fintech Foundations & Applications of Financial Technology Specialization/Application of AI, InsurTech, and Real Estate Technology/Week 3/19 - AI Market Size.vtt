1
00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.050
Now the market size of

2
00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:06.960
artificial intelligence
as a way of understanding

3
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.510
its impact confronts
a challenge of how we

4
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.450
exactly define what
artificial intelligence is.

5
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.090
Some, with a broad view
like Forrester Research

6
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.330
suggests that more than a
trillion dollars worldwide has

7
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.580
been invested in some form of

8
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.020
computing technology that
brings to bear a notion of

9
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.215
cognition whether it's related to

10
00:00:28.215 --> 00:00:31.845
direct existing human
activities or is

11
00:00:31.845 --> 00:00:36.745
new or is confronting or using
unstructured information.

12
00:00:36.745 --> 00:00:41.555
Tractica a research suggests
that the size of AI,

13
00:00:41.555 --> 00:00:43.025
again not just in Fintech,

14
00:00:43.025 --> 00:00:49.565
but more generally is
about $37 billion by 2025.

15
00:00:49.565 --> 00:00:52.230
The consulting company
Accenture writes that

16
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.710
more than $8 trillion in

17
00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.900
market value will
have been invested

18
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.375
in artificial
intelligence by 2035.

19
00:00:59.375 --> 00:01:01.190
Finally on the finance side,

20
00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.575
Bank of America
Merrill suggests that

21
00:01:03.575 --> 00:01:06.125
artificial intelligence
based systems

22
00:01:06.125 --> 00:01:12.065
have or will have about a $70
billion market cap by 2025.

23
00:01:12.065 --> 00:01:14.990
Again your aspect ratio
or your definition

24
00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.800
of industry sector purpose and so

25
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.870
on in defining
artificial intelligence will

26
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.490
give us a sense of how narrow or

27
00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.725
broadly we define
what the market is.

28
00:01:24.725 --> 00:01:28.400
But one sense of the scale

29
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.480
comes when we realize that
artificial intelligence can be

30
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.160
applied in nearly every arena

31
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.380
whether we're talking
about entertainment or

32
00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.210
finance or even fundamental
traditional industries,

33
00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.045
manufacturing
industries, and so on.

34
00:01:44.045 --> 00:01:49.205
The new IoT or Internet of
Things concept of devices,

35
00:01:49.205 --> 00:01:52.400
tracking data, and sharing
data across them in

36
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.660
a network setting could

37
00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.540
itself be related or
defined cognition.

38
00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.420
Self-driving vehicles, healthcare
bots, wearable devices,

39
00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.290
and so on brings to bear

40
00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.125
the idea that everything
could be connected,

41
00:02:06.125 --> 00:02:08.420
and so that artificial
intelligence will

42
00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.275
affect every aspect of life.

43
00:02:11.275 --> 00:02:15.410
Now, different observers have
identified different areas

44
00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.585
where revenues and
applications are dispersed.

45
00:02:20.585 --> 00:02:22.670
Drilling down into
those provides a kind

46
00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.860
of view additional to what we

47
00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.570
mentioned a second
ago about some of

48
00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.165
the specific use cases that

49
00:02:29.165 --> 00:02:32.135
may harbor advantage for firms,

50
00:02:32.135 --> 00:02:34.070
for financial services
professionals,

51
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:35.855
and ultimately customers.

52
00:02:35.855 --> 00:02:37.850
Consider the idea of analyzing

53
00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.595
contracts using
artificial intelligence and

54
00:02:40.595 --> 00:02:42.200
the attorneys who are

55
00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.820
listening may be a little bit
nervous that hearing this,

56
00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.200
more regulators might be
happy to hear about it,

57
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.370
or compliance officers
may be happy as well.

58
00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.250
The idea that algorithms are able

59
00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.400
to read the texts
of contracts and

60
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.420
identify areas of
risk or areas of

61
00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.250
commonality with other contracts

62
00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.280
or discontinuities and so on,

63
00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.270
is an area of rapid expansion
in possibility.

64
00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.645
The idea of detecting

65
00:03:13.645 --> 00:03:16.965
objects, classifying
objects physically,

66
00:03:16.965 --> 00:03:19.740
understanding motion size,

67
00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.245
understanding how
to avoid objects,

68
00:03:22.245 --> 00:03:25.155
for example with
self-driving vehicles,

69
00:03:25.155 --> 00:03:27.030
is certainly a part
of our future.

70
00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:34.435
Understanding imagery, detecting
identity, classifying,

71
00:03:34.435 --> 00:03:39.050
tracking images and
objects in real-time or in

72
00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.020
retrospect represents
a very large area

73
00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:45.320
of current research
impossible monetization.

74
00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.180
For example, a series of

75
00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.580
research projects at the
University of Pennsylvania and

76
00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.730
elsewhere have
identified that pictures

77
00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.105
posted on Facebook
can be useful in

78
00:03:56.105 --> 00:03:59.420
identifying individual
personality but can also be

79
00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.885
aggregated to identify
health risks and

80
00:04:02.885 --> 00:04:07.010
other aspects that in

81
00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:08.570
a more structured
environment would

82
00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:10.750
require the intervention
of humanity.

83
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.950
The ability to understand

84
00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:18.170
geophysical features or
querying of images in

85
00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:21.605
efficient manners across
perhaps thousands

86
00:04:21.605 --> 00:04:26.290
of objects is another area
of potential advancement.

87
00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:30.035
Then preferencing or
customizing on social media or

88
00:04:30.035 --> 00:04:32.660
elsewhere content
including advertising

89
00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.315
and marketing content is already,

90
00:04:35.315 --> 00:04:36.905
and will certainly
continue to be,

91
00:04:36.905 --> 00:04:40.310
valuable for those innovators

92
00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.665
who are bringing to
bear the techniques.

93
00:04:42.665 --> 00:04:44.985
Being able to identify

94
00:04:44.985 --> 00:04:48.710
normal or abnormal use
to be able to predict

95
00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.500
maintenance requirements
ranging from

96
00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.315
smart homes to vehicles

97
00:04:53.315 --> 00:04:55.540
even potentially
to your portfolio,

98
00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:00.195
another area of
identified revenues.

99
00:05:00.195 --> 00:05:02.570
Healthcare applications of
artificial intelligence

100
00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:03.680
had been made famous by

101
00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.120
a number of players some of whom

102
00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.070
we'll talk about in just a bit.

103
00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:09.230
But the idea that

104
00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:11.750
the processing of patient data

105
00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:13.655
specifically or in the aggregate

106
00:05:13.655 --> 00:05:16.820
giving rise to
potential treatments

107
00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:18.860
of very intractable challenges

108
00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:25.215
like sepsis or healthcare
challenges including outbreaks,

109
00:05:25.215 --> 00:05:29.850
even specific cases
of patient wellness,

110
00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:33.675
doing it quickly,
doing it at scale,

111
00:05:33.675 --> 00:05:35.630
and doing it a way that provides

112
00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:38.885
structure which under
normal circumstances would

113
00:05:38.885 --> 00:05:41.150
either be prone to frailties

114
00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:44.195
and biases that humans
naturally have.

115
00:05:44.195 --> 00:05:46.789
For example, doctors
making different diagnoses

116
00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:49.790
based on the time of the day
in which they see patients,

117
00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:53.120
but also again aggregating
trends in a way

118
00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.995
that may provide betterment
in general healthcare.

119
00:05:56.995 --> 00:06:00.559
Classifying static images or
what we call unstructured

120
00:06:00.559 --> 00:06:04.675
data in real time or
in a delayed fashion,

121
00:06:04.675 --> 00:06:08.840
adding tremendous potential
revenue value over time.

122
00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:13.880
Then finally, the area
identified often as the area

123
00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.610
for greatest investment in

124
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:19.910
the financial industry,
algorithmic trading.

125
00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:21.980
I often hear complaints about

126
00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:24.170
how individual
investors feel they

127
00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:25.850
aren't able to keep up with

128
00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:28.670
so-called algorithmic
trading and exchanges.

129
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:30.530
Well, let me just say
this, if you make

130
00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:33.280
a trade even if it's through
say a discount broker,

131
00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:36.350
almost certainly there
are trades being executed

132
00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:39.935
for your own specific directions
algorithmically.

133
00:06:39.935 --> 00:06:43.370
It's hard to imagine any trades
having today that aren't

134
00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:45.080
somehow bolstered by

135
00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:48.230
technical algorithms in
electronic connections,

136
00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:50.600
but the next generations
will improve

137
00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.375
the dimension reduction
required for

138
00:06:53.375 --> 00:06:55.940
optimal trade performance at

139
00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:59.700
an ever faster rate and
with more accuracy.
