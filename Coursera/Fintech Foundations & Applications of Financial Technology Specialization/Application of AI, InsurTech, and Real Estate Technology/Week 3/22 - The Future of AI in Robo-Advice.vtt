00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:03.480
So let's talk about the future of

2
00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.850
Artificial Intelligence
in robo-Advice,

3
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.380
especially as it relates to

4
00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.395
interactions with
customers directly.

5
00:00:10.395 --> 00:00:12.840
The definition of robo-advisors

6
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.710
and robo-advisory activities
is fairly fuzzy.

7
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.939
It originally meant, a kind
of business model organized

8
00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.430
around algorithms
to reduce costs of

9
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.595
client service
disintermediating humans.

10
00:00:26.595 --> 00:00:30.360
However, today that
definition has changed.

11
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.075
Now we think of it as
a financial advisory, firm,

12
00:00:33.075 --> 00:00:34.410
a practice, and enterprise

13
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.730
in the financial
services industry,

14
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.610
using an algorithm to build
a customer allocation,

15
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.775
based on automated and
usually online inputs.

16
00:00:42.775 --> 00:00:45.930
Those so-called robo-advisors
usually provide,

17
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.800
capture of client
information, their goals,

18
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.165
their capacity,
their preferences,

19
00:00:52.165 --> 00:00:54.590
or their tolerance
for taking risk.

20
00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.360
It includes output of
portfolio allocations,

21
00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.750
or a set of portfolio
allocations or options,

22
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.445
for clients to choose.

23
00:01:01.445 --> 00:01:04.295
It could also include
automated rebalancing

24
00:01:04.295 --> 00:01:06.350
of positions across time,

25
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.285
or across market
conditions change,

26
00:01:08.285 --> 00:01:10.655
or it could involve
and in some cases

27
00:01:10.655 --> 00:01:13.460
reportedly does
tax loss harvesting,

28
00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.505
or optimal rebalancing
of taxable portfolios.

29
00:01:16.505 --> 00:01:19.170
Finally of course,
automated reporting

30
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.160
which an industry that

31
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.200
has found automated
reporting to be,

32
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.055
at least historically
challenging, a welcome feature.

33
00:01:28.055 --> 00:01:31.235
Theoretically speaking
because algorithms and

34
00:01:31.235 --> 00:01:36.425
artificially oriented bots
can learn from experience,

35
00:01:36.425 --> 00:01:39.260
perhaps they can become more
personal and more human,

36
00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.170
and therefore more
relatable across time.

37
00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.580
Perhaps they can also make

38
00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.680
more responsible
decisions however,

39
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.720
recent market
experience including

40
00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.850
across periods of
market volatility,

41
00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.950
suggests that most clients
are comfortable

42
00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.200
without human oversight
at some point.

43
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.030
In part that comes down to trust

44
00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.890
or the lack of trust
and algorithms,

45
00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.200
especially in the face of

46
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.475
uncertainty about the outcomes
of the algorithm.

47
00:02:03.475 --> 00:02:05.810
Two of the largest
so-called robots

48
00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.670
that are independent of
larger firms namely,

49
00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.280
Wealthfront and
Betterment, both have

50
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.900
"client services
representatives" as an example.

51
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.890
As far as we know
no "pure" vision of

52
00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.730
the original robo-notion
has been achieved.

53
00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.060
However, the model is incredibly

54
00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.655
useful because it
sets a baseline,

55
00:02:25.655 --> 00:02:28.880
and ultimately a
cost-based competitor.

56
00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.430
The traditional human only model,

57
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.775
almost surely where
it's all going,

58
00:02:33.775 --> 00:02:36.110
will involve what we
now call a bionic

59
00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.675
model linking humans
and algorithms,

60
00:02:38.675 --> 00:02:41.150
and hopefully the best
of both worlds together.

61
00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.890
As you might recall,

62
00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.425
growth has been
tremendous in this area.

63
00:02:45.425 --> 00:02:47.300
Vanguard Personal
Advisor Services

64
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.210
rebranded as a Robo
in May of 2015,

65
00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:53.725
then had around $21
billion in assets,

66
00:02:53.725 --> 00:02:58.125
as of 2018, it had
over $100 billion.

67
00:02:58.125 --> 00:03:01.034
Wealthfront the independent Robo,

68
00:03:01.034 --> 00:03:03.150
currently has over $11 billion,

69
00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.510
and Betterment now has 16.5,

70
00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.800
90 percent of Wealthfront assets

71
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.150
are actually allocate
the Vanguard funds.

72
00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.420
Although the business
strategies of

73
00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.330
these two large
independent robo-firms

74
00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:18.815
has differed for example,

75
00:03:18.815 --> 00:03:22.400
Betterment recently shifted
its business model to

76
00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.170
emphasize defined contribution

77
00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.705
retirement plan activities,

78
00:03:26.705 --> 00:03:32.000
as opposed to purely
non-taxable DC business,

79
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.030
both have seen traumatic growth.

80
00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.325
In addition, traditional
brokerage firms

81
00:03:37.325 --> 00:03:39.650
including discount
brokerage firms,

82
00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.264
have offered robot-like
offerings including Schwab,

83
00:03:43.264 --> 00:03:47.320
Bank of America Merrill
Lynch, and Fidelity.
