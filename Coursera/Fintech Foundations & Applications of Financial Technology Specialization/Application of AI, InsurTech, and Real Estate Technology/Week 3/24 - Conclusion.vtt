00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:07.034
So although we've taken a fairly high
overview look of artificial intelligence,

2
00:00:07.034 --> 00:00:11.112
machine learning and so on,
in the financial technology space,

3
00:00:11.112 --> 00:00:14.314
it should be fairly clear
that it has a role to play.

4
00:00:14.314 --> 00:00:16.830
In fact, perhaps even a definitional role.

5
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.940
Today, and no doubt, in the future.

6
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:25.610
However, we also have to recognize that
some of its utility is sort of mundane.

7
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.470
The scope of which is perhaps,
some might say old school,

8
00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:38.226
despite the appeal of thinking
about the overarching,

9
00:00:38.226 --> 00:00:44.300
self-aware intelligence made famous
in a number of movies over the years.

10
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.110
The actual business case for artificial
intelligence is perhaps, more regular.

11
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.750
For example, as opposed to traditional
customer service representatives,

12
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.670
chatbots don't call in sick.

13
00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.790
They don't have human biases, necessarily.

14
00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.330
It might work 24/7 without complaint,
and perhaps,

15
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:07.480
don't care about the marginal cost paid
to them, which might be close to zero.

16
00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:12.490
While it may be possible to look at
the landscape today and sit back and

17
00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.500
make prognostications about the future,
in part because the cost is so low.

18
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.210
It's actually challenging to develop

19
00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.260
a legitimate forecast with conviction
about where it all might go.

20
00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.180
Certainly, the possibilities seem endless,
but it does take a lot to get there.

21
00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.755
AI has been hyped,
especially by technology consultancies and

22
00:01:34.755 --> 00:01:42.575
by academics, and by FinTech backers and
notably, expectedly, some will fail.

23
00:01:42.575 --> 00:01:45.115
We expect that with any kind
of technological revolution.

24
00:01:46.187 --> 00:01:49.477
Some AI technology will,
however, be successful,

25
00:01:49.477 --> 00:01:51.727
they may reduce barriers to entry.

26
00:01:51.727 --> 00:01:57.667
They may increase the benefits of costs,
reduction and advancement of scale.

27
00:01:59.137 --> 00:02:04.997
And to those who are first movers,
it may give them an advantage

28
00:02:04.997 --> 00:02:08.109
that may prove to be
insurmountable to others.

29
00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.220
The possibility that artificial
intelligence may need to be reined in,

30
00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:15.380
either voluntarily or

31
00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.320
again, via oversight,
perhaps put in place by regulators.

32
00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.700
So at the end of the day,
it's an exciting arena.

33
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.360
It's a core area.

34
00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.870
It's an area of rapid advancement and
a lot of excitement.

35
00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.510
And it's improving the state
of the industry everywhere.

36
00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.344
It may hold a lot of promise for
the future, but

37
00:02:36.344 --> 00:02:38.593
that will also be an empirical question.
