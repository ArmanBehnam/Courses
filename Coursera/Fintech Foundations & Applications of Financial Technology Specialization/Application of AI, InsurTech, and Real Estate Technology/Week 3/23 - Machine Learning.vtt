00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.740
One area of artificial
intelligence that has

2
00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.120
gained a lot of

3
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.610
traction and attention
is machine learning.

4
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.240
Essentially, the idea that
using neural networks or

5
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.160
related technologies
allows computer algorithms

6
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.420
to so so-called
learn across time.

7
00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.559
The idea behind machine learning
at its core is to allow

8
00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:28.370
computers using structured

9
00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:30.470
algorithms to acquire knowledge,

10
00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.110
extracting patterns
from input data

11
00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.320
rather than following
rules themselves.

12
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.570
In other words,
pattern recognition

13
00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.730
based on input data
which is structured in

14
00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.575
the form of say numerics or

15
00:00:42.575 --> 00:00:45.020
unstructured in
the form of language,

16
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.030
text, images, and so on.

17
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.610
In the insurance
industry for example,

18
00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:51.860
there are some insurers

19
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.810
and others in
the distribution chain

20
00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:55.040
who are using machine learning.

21
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.869
However,

22
00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:58.070
the National Association
of Insurance Commissioners

23
00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.860
has identified that
most insurers are only

24
00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.080
using 10 to 15 percent
of the data they

25
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.120
collect from customers and

26
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.810
from the environments in which
their customers operate.

27
00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.860
Machine learning
potentially could

28
00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.020
allow insurers to extract

29
00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.730
more information from
this large sample set

30
00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:18.365
of data they have.

31
00:01:18.365 --> 00:01:20.780
For example, they potentially

32
00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.865
could analyze claims data better,

33
00:01:22.865 --> 00:01:25.340
they could understand the risk

34
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.545
of their businesses better,

35
00:01:27.545 --> 00:01:29.615
they could use
mathematical models

36
00:01:29.615 --> 00:01:31.700
including machine learning models

37
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.535
to predict demand for products,

38
00:01:33.535 --> 00:01:36.230
and of course to estimate
premiums more accurately.

39
00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:39.990
As we've mentioned in
other lectures, detecting fraud,

40
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.165
identifying patterns of behavior

41
00:01:42.165 --> 00:01:45.490
that are not obvious
to human adjusters who

42
00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.455
classically use their
understanding of human behavior

43
00:01:50.455 --> 00:01:53.200
to detect fraud along

44
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.260
with identification of
fraudulent image provision.

45
00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.460
Processing claims ensures
using machine learning to make

46
00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.115
more automatic claims
reporting a processing

47
00:02:03.115 --> 00:02:07.040
improving potentially
customer satisfaction.

48
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.445
Ultimately, one of
the most important jobs

49
00:02:09.445 --> 00:02:11.065
of an insurance carrier;

50
00:02:11.065 --> 00:02:15.010
making underwriting decisions,
analyzing data,

51
00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.680
collecting data from applicants

52
00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.615
individually and
in the aggregate,

53
00:02:19.615 --> 00:02:23.260
perhaps flagging errors
or inconsistencies that

54
00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.370
underwriters
themselves may not be

55
00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.385
able to see or see irregularly.

56
00:02:28.385 --> 00:02:31.145
In addition, computers can check

57
00:02:31.145 --> 00:02:33.425
external sources
such as social media

58
00:02:33.425 --> 00:02:35.240
to verify accuracy of

59
00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.885
data and also provide
estimates of risk.

60
00:02:38.885 --> 00:02:40.879
As we mentioned earlier,

61
00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:42.740
algorithmic trading and portfolio

62
00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.660
construction by institutions

63
00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.280
represents one of
the largest areas of

64
00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.265
growth for artificial
intelligence.

65
00:02:49.265 --> 00:02:52.040
A recent survey by
BarclayHedged found that

66
00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.160
more than half of
hedge fund surveyed are

67
00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.500
currently using artificial
intelligence with some form of

68
00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.340
machine learning to help
create portfolio strategies,

69
00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.630
trading algorithms, and
make investment decisions.

70
00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.580
About 25 percent of

71
00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.160
money managers
themselves and not just

72
00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.840
their brokers are using it for

73
00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.955
trade execution, monitoring,
and decision-making.

74
00:03:15.955 --> 00:03:19.190
Now, understanding
exactly what AI is

75
00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.950
to all participants
is a challenge.

76
00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.650
In fact, not necessarily
every algorithm could be

77
00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.565
classified as
artificial intelligence.

78
00:03:27.565 --> 00:03:30.560
However, responses
to a survey which

79
00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.500
is ultimately made
public is likely to mask

80
00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.320
the true depth and breadth of

81
00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.780
penetration of
artificial intelligence

82
00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.960
in the trading world.

83
00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.140
Of course, there are
numerous well-known

84
00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.120
examples of hedge funds

85
00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.010
like Renaissance
Technologies, Bridgewater,

86
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.765
and DE Shaw that are

87
00:03:49.765 --> 00:03:51.910
often mentioned as
pioneers and have been

88
00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:53.860
for decades in the area

89
00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:55.870
of artificial intelligence
and machine learning.

90
00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.330
However, due to
confidentiality concerns,

91
00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.285
presumably details are limited.

92
00:04:01.285 --> 00:04:04.885
Another area of
both academic research and

93
00:04:04.885 --> 00:04:07.330
industry interest is the area of

94
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.750
textual analysis,
reading news stories,

95
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.990
financial press releases, firms

96
00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:18.150
release of quarterly reports
known as 10Qs,

97
00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:19.830
or annual reports known as 10Ks,

98
00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:21.730
as well as other
regulatory filings

99
00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.220
that are available
in public databases.

100
00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.550
In recent years,
several hedge funds launched

101
00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.330
specifically focusing on
exploitation of this strategy.

102
00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.220
However, we haven't heard much

103
00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.320
about their success or failure,

104
00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.270
which should not be
a surprise to anyone.

105
00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.360
Now perhaps the most
famous brand in all of

106
00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.730
artificial intelligence to
date is the IBM Watson.

107
00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:47.140
Watson, which gained
its name from

108
00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:51.220
legendary CEO Thomas Watson began

109
00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.935
as a computer which beat

110
00:04:53.935 --> 00:04:58.480
human opponents on Jeopardy
nearly a decade ago.

111
00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:03.335
Later, IBM took the famous
IBM Watson name,

112
00:05:03.335 --> 00:05:07.450
focusing on an AI system
capable of collecting,

113
00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:09.665
curating, and analyzing data

114
00:05:09.665 --> 00:05:11.570
including natural language and

115
00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:14.870
natural language
processing ultimately

116
00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:16.775
designed to beat the Turing test.

117
00:05:16.775 --> 00:05:19.040
A number of products across

118
00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.935
different types of
businesses has resulted.

119
00:05:21.935 --> 00:05:24.545
The first use for
IBM Watson's team

120
00:05:24.545 --> 00:05:28.640
as far back as 2013
was assisting in

121
00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.130
healthcare payment
authorization decisions

122
00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:32.570
in cancer treatments.

123
00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:36.010
This was for a client company
called Wellpoint.

124
00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:38.455
In addition to health care,

125
00:05:38.455 --> 00:05:41.150
other target industries purported

126
00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:44.090
for IBM Watson including retail,

127
00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:49.890
tax preparation, academics,
and other areas of finance.
