1
00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.575
So the reach and impact of
artificial intelligence

2
00:00:04.575 --> 00:00:08.590
in FinTech is obviously
broad and deep.

3
00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:10.560
To get a sense of

4
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.410
the various kinds of
applications and a number

5
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.014
of companies that have targeted
activity in those areas,

6
00:00:18.014 --> 00:00:21.210
it's useful to take a look at
a map like the CB Insights,

7
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.550
AI and FinTech market map.

8
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.400
Some companies have focused on

9
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.740
the B2C market in providing

10
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.995
personal financial advice
or financial assistance,

11
00:00:31.995 --> 00:00:34.030
in some cases providing

12
00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.150
aggregation services
or financial advice

13
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.535
or wealth management services.

14
00:00:40.535 --> 00:00:42.895
Others have focused
more directly,

15
00:00:42.895 --> 00:00:44.240
although in some cases still in

16
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.515
the B2C arena on
quantitative asset management,

17
00:00:48.515 --> 00:00:51.440
either again, at
the trading level

18
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.880
or at the general portfolio
allocation level.

19
00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.530
Insures find all kinds of

20
00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.429
uses of artificial
intelligence ranging from

21
00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:04.655
credit risk management to

22
00:01:04.655 --> 00:01:09.080
claims integrity across
the value chain in the industry.

23
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.005
Market research
including the analysis

24
00:01:12.005 --> 00:01:13.850
of market sentiment has

25
00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.830
become a burgeoning area

26
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.040
of both investment and
product development.

27
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.690
The ability to reduce

28
00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.525
the dimensionality of very
complicated structured

29
00:01:23.525 --> 00:01:26.585
including numerical data as
well as unstructured data

30
00:01:26.585 --> 00:01:30.515
ranging from news streams
across multiple languages

31
00:01:30.515 --> 00:01:34.310
to images and so on delivered to

32
00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.575
the desktop of
financial professionals

33
00:01:36.575 --> 00:01:38.440
is really quite raging.

34
00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.210
Debt collection and
the ability to follow

35
00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.060
people who have debts
across time and

36
00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.350
across geographies is
an advancing arena

37
00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.355
of both investment and activity,

38
00:01:51.355 --> 00:01:54.980
and the mundane task of
expense reporting and

39
00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.120
tracking business
activities has become

40
00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.655
a natural arena in which

41
00:02:01.655 --> 00:02:04.295
artificial intelligence
has the possibility

42
00:02:04.295 --> 00:02:07.260
of improving outcomes
for its users.

43
00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.160
Predictive analytics which
is about as broad and

44
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.340
areas one can imagine has seen

45
00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.760
tremendous investment
and also has promised

46
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.175
some substantial outcomes again,

47
00:02:19.175 --> 00:02:21.815
including unseen possibilities.

48
00:02:21.815 --> 00:02:23.330
As a personal example,

49
00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.670
a couple years ago
at a conference

50
00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.370
for the Jacobs Levy Center
that I run at Wharton,

51
00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:29.960
we had a paper describing how

52
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.550
the financial crisis potentially

53
00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.425
could have been better
identified as far back as 2005,

54
00:02:35.425 --> 00:02:39.170
based on predictive analytics
and big data analysis of

55
00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.160
both statements and
financial reporting

56
00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.505
from financial services firms.

57
00:02:45.505 --> 00:02:48.075
Using internal or external data,

58
00:02:48.075 --> 00:02:51.280
the artificial
intelligence applications

59
00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.839
for detecting fraud,

60
00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:55.075
regulatory compliance,

61
00:02:55.075 --> 00:02:57.880
the bailiwick of
chief compliance officers

62
00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.730
and others is a natural locus

63
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.830
for artificial
intelligence applications.

64
00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:10.050
Even the gray area of
aggressiveness in disclosures,

65
00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:11.330
accounting statements,

66
00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.870
and corporate activity
has been linked

67
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.905
back to analysis of
unstructured data.

68
00:03:17.905 --> 00:03:20.440
For example,
some articles have been

69
00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.960
published including in
the top accounting journals,

70
00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:28.220
suggesting that
C-Suite Executive behavior

71
00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.000
which is detectable
using pictures

72
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.580
which represent levels
of testosterone

73
00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:41.420
in executive biologies
are related to again,

74
00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.485
accounting aggressiveness
and in some cases fraud.

75
00:03:44.485 --> 00:03:46.620
Finally, last but not least,

76
00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.189
the ability to score
credits, understand risks,

77
00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:53.179
make lending decisions especially

78
00:03:53.179 --> 00:03:56.930
when multiple sources of
data can be combined,

79
00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.630
especially if they're
in different formats or

80
00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:05.130
very high pay-off areas for
artificial intelligence.
