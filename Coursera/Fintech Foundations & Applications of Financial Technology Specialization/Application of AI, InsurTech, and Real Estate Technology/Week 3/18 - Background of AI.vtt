1
00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:02.970
Hi folks, welcome back.

2
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.830
This is Professor
Chris Geczy again.

3
00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.510
In this module we'll be talking

4
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:10.095
about what some have
come to consider,

5
00:00:10.095 --> 00:00:12.570
to be the backbone
of Fintech today,

6
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.750
and certainly in the future,
Artificial Intelligence.

7
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.700
We'll take a very
high level view,

8
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.125
a general view of the role of

9
00:00:19.125 --> 00:00:22.230
Artificial Intelligence in
the area Financial Services,

10
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.970
Fintech Robo Advisory and
related adjunct arenas.

11
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.385
Here's a thing you need
to think about as we talk

12
00:00:29.385 --> 00:00:32.115
about the role of
artificial intelligence.

13
00:00:32.115 --> 00:00:33.690
At its core, it's about

14
00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.540
dimension reduction,
it's about efficiency,

15
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.485
it's about seeing patterns
in data or input,

16
00:00:41.485 --> 00:00:43.985
information structured
or unstructured

17
00:00:43.985 --> 00:00:47.155
that lends value in
financial services.

18
00:00:47.155 --> 00:00:49.010
Artificial intelligence has had

19
00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.105
a notable history in
science and economics.

20
00:00:53.105 --> 00:00:56.585
Some Identify the famous
scientist Alan Turing

21
00:00:56.585 --> 00:00:59.510
in the 1940s as having developed

22
00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.155
the first theory
underlying the notion of

23
00:01:03.155 --> 00:01:06.185
sentient algorithms
or sentient machines

24
00:01:06.185 --> 00:01:08.935
in defining Artificial
Intelligence.

25
00:01:08.935 --> 00:01:11.735
Turing, again famously thought

26
00:01:11.735 --> 00:01:13.700
of a machine that could
program itself and

27
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.905
learn from inputs and experience,
to simulate humanity.

28
00:01:18.905 --> 00:01:22.600
A famous test called
the Turing Test is

29
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.175
a baseline notion of

30
00:01:25.175 --> 00:01:28.955
a self-recognizing
machine intelligence.

31
00:01:28.955 --> 00:01:33.440
For example, if an algorithm or

32
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.110
an evaluator cannot
tell the difference

33
00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.199
between two parties
it has not yet seen,

34
00:01:39.199 --> 00:01:41.795
say a human and a computer,

35
00:01:41.795 --> 00:01:44.690
then the machine via
conversation could be

36
00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.200
considered to be displaying
intelligent behavior.

37
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.270
So one of the oldest
definitions of

38
00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.710
Artificial Intelligence makes

39
00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.530
direct reference to humanity.

40
00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.050
Of course, our conversation

41
00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.315
about what it
ultimately means to be

42
00:01:59.315 --> 00:02:04.115
intelligent or self-aware comes
down to your metaphysics.

43
00:02:04.115 --> 00:02:08.315
It comes down to
your ideological beliefs.

44
00:02:08.315 --> 00:02:10.490
It involves philosophical issues

45
00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.530
beyond that which we're
going to cover here.

46
00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.780
However, many have
treated this over

47
00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.555
the years both thinking about

48
00:02:17.555 --> 00:02:20.360
the possibilities and
potentially the challenges and

49
00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.925
dangers of machines sentients.

50
00:02:23.925 --> 00:02:26.030
In recent times, that's

51
00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.170
arisen in conversations
about regulation,

52
00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.985
auditing, and safety of

53
00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:35.075
algorithmic approaches
in all parts of life.

54
00:02:35.075 --> 00:02:37.685
A colleague recently asked

55
00:02:37.685 --> 00:02:41.465
me a question that I
felt was surprising.

56
00:02:41.465 --> 00:02:44.570
He asked me about
Big Data in finance.

57
00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.855
Specifically he
asked the question:

58
00:02:46.855 --> 00:02:49.095
Does finance ever
deal with Big Data?

59
00:02:49.095 --> 00:02:50.940
My response of course
was that well,

60
00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.540
finance invented Big Data.

61
00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.160
That might not
exactly be true from

62
00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.920
all viewpoints but it's
certainly the case

63
00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.575
that financial firms
have involved

64
00:03:00.575 --> 00:03:04.310
technology for decades and

65
00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.035
perhaps even hundreds of years.

66
00:03:06.035 --> 00:03:09.380
For example, in the late 1800s
the first stock ticker was

67
00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.460
invented just before
Thomas Edison

68
00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.880
developed his own model
for tickers,

69
00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.800
which was ultimately
monetized by Western Union.

70
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.640
Financial firms also were

71
00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.040
early adopters of
computers back then,

72
00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.630
what we call mainframe computers,

73
00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.885
as well as databases that
could house and rapidly

74
00:03:29.885 --> 00:03:35.140
retrieve structured data
in the form of numerics.

75
00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.515
Today, this arms race
is hotter than ever

76
00:03:39.515 --> 00:03:44.405
and Artificial Intelligence,
natural language processing,

77
00:03:44.405 --> 00:03:46.910
the reading and understanding
of unstructured data

78
00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.565
including images,
neural networks,

79
00:03:49.565 --> 00:03:51.725
which represent to

80
00:03:51.725 --> 00:03:52.880
those who are technically

81
00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.280
oriented non-parametric
regressions,

82
00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.180
and Big Data analytics are
all at the cutting edge,

83
00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.775
the vanguard of future.

84
00:04:01.775 --> 00:04:03.610
Twenty-five years ago,

85
00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.570
if we were thinking
about accessing

86
00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:07.550
various finance databases like

87
00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:08.870
the famous Center for Research

88
00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.130
and Security Prices database,

89
00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.095
the CRISP database or others,

90
00:04:12.095 --> 00:04:16.370
we typically needed
to bear the cost of

91
00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:22.625
both time and monetary expenses
for direct access.

92
00:04:22.625 --> 00:04:24.365
They have to have a
computer terminal

93
00:04:24.365 --> 00:04:26.405
and maybe a license.

94
00:04:26.405 --> 00:04:30.100
Today, accessing
Big Data is achievable

95
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:36.410
rapidly in smaller formats
and even on phones,

96
00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.840
which are today of
course ubiquitous.

97
00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.210
All that having been said,

98
00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:46.190
most areas of finance are still
oriented around humanity.

99
00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.320
Some would call it
not a quantitative

100
00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.305
pure model but a
quantimental model.

101
00:04:51.305 --> 00:04:57.055
Ultimately with respect
to advisory activities,

102
00:04:57.055 --> 00:04:59.330
unless you believe that
three million years of

103
00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.470
human advancement has
resulted in simply an app,

104
00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.395
the idea of interaction,

105
00:05:04.395 --> 00:05:08.880
the ability to trust
activities has

106
00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.230
confronted the notion of

107
00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:14.805
algorithmic trust and
the role of humans.

108
00:05:14.805 --> 00:05:17.755
Computers can simulate humanity,

109
00:05:17.755 --> 00:05:22.245
especially in routine tasks
like on-boarding accounting,

110
00:05:22.245 --> 00:05:25.000
reporting, and in
some cases regulatory,

111
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.885
oversight, and so on.

112
00:05:26.885 --> 00:05:30.650
But the human almost surely
has not yet lost its role.

113
00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.775
Now the core definitions of
Artificial Intelligence range

114
00:05:34.775 --> 00:05:39.680
among various characteristics
across official sources.

115
00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.330
The Oxford Living Dictionary

116
00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.490
describes artificial
intelligence as 'the theory and

117
00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.020
development of
computer systems that

118
00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:46.580
are themselves able to perform

119
00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.740
tasks requiring under

120
00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:51.890
normal circumstances direct
human intelligence',

121
00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:55.905
and that could be
understanding of images,

122
00:05:55.905 --> 00:05:58.345
recognizing text or speech,

123
00:05:58.345 --> 00:06:00.110
making decisions in

124
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:03.290
an unstructured environment
with or without

125
00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:08.765
partial rules or the advent
of partial structures,

126
00:06:08.765 --> 00:06:11.120
including translation
across languages and

127
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.500
not just human languages but

128
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:15.395
various languages
understandable by machines.

129
00:06:15.395 --> 00:06:17.180
Merriam Webster's Dictionary

130
00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:18.520
describes Artificial
Intelligence as,

131
00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.900
a branch of computer
science dealing

132
00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.780
with again the simulation
of intelligent behavior

133
00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:25.310
human behavior in computers

134
00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:27.290
presumably or the capability of

135
00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:31.405
a machine to imitate
intelligent human behavior.

136
00:06:31.405 --> 00:06:35.075
Others have identified
Artificial Intelligence

137
00:06:35.075 --> 00:06:38.510
as aiming to try to
understand tasks,

138
00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:42.905
processes, and of course
products that encode them

139
00:06:42.905 --> 00:06:44.959
toward the application
of solutions

140
00:06:44.959 --> 00:06:48.030
that involve
self-directed learning.

141
00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:49.790
Which some would suggest
is the equivalent

142
00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:52.300
of reasoning,
self-awareness, perception,

143
00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:55.040
and problem-solving
in a manner that

144
00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:58.370
is at least from
an observational perspective,

145
00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:00.910
how humans are able to perform.

146
00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:04.160
Areas in which Artificial
Intelligence relate to

147
00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:07.610
other disciplines like
mathematics, computer,

148
00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:11.120
linguistic, psychology and
other sciences link back

149
00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.010
directly to the notion and

150
00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:16.620
perception of what
humanity looks like.
