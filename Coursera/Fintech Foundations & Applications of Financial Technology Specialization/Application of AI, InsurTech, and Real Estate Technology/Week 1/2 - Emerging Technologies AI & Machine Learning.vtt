00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.310
The area of artificial intelligence is
especially exciting, as it might be

2
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:14.370
applied to the FinTech,
robo advisor and ensure tech areas.

3
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.000
What is an artificial intelligence again?

4
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.564
Well, ultimately, it's a description
of software which can perform all kinds

5
00:00:23.564 --> 00:00:30.042
of tasks that are historically normally
associated with reasoning by humans.

6
00:00:30.042 --> 00:00:35.609
That could be learning,
it could be simulating self-awareness,

7
00:00:35.609 --> 00:00:40.298
including potentially
the perception of emotions, and

8
00:00:40.298 --> 00:00:45.490
insurers have focus on harnessing
artificial intelligence.

9
00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:50.290
First, with respect to
customer interactions,

10
00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:55.710
chatbots, for example, or programs that
communicate with customers verbally,

11
00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.530
through text,
ultimately guiding decision-making.

12
00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.570
Allstate, for example,
the well-known insurance company,

13
00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.660
created a chatbot called ABIE,
the Allstate Business Insurance Expert.

14
00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:13.810
ABIE, specifically residing on Allstate's
website, provides answers 24/7,

15
00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:19.945
365 days a year,
to answer policy owners' queries.

16
00:01:19.945 --> 00:01:23.850
Other insurance companies have followed,

17
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.520
specifically focusing on
answering customer questions,

18
00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.340
help them complete applications,
or even filing claim reports.

19
00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.860
Another type of Insurtech is machine
learning, which is a subset of AI.

20
00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.750
Allowing computers and
their software algorithms to simulate

21
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.500
learning or data augmentation and
knowledge augmentation over time.

22
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:59.479
Using rules or models to
simulate the way the brain works.

23
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.160
This kind of learning, machine learning,

24
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:09.520
allows computers to extract patterns from
data and that could be structured data,

25
00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.970
in the form of numerical data, or
unstructured data, in the form of text,

26
00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.630
or other elements including pictures,

27
00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.700
rather than following highly
specific instructions.

28
00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.940
Of course, instructions
are important in the definition

29
00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.380
of the algorithms that
machine learning represent.

30
00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.410
But in as far as machine learning can self

31
00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:43.140
replicate or operate under
a broader set of instructions.

32
00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.150
Machine learning gives the appearance of

33
00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.740
being closer to the activities
of the human brain.

34
00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:55.680
Not many insurance are currently
using what we call deep learning,

35
00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:56.420
machine learning.

36
00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.210
Certain insurance companies
are applying it to

37
00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:01.985
huge amounts of data that they collect.

38
00:03:01.985 --> 00:03:06.610
NAIT, so the National Association
of Insurance Commissioners,

39
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.950
indicates that only about 10 to
15 percent of the data collected

40
00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.600
by insurance companies is
currently actively used.

41
00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.600
Machine learning could allow those
insurers to look at large amounts of data,

42
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.740
sometimes known as Big Data,
to extract patterns that are useful for

43
00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:25.660
their businesses.

44
00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.720
Some examples could include risk modeling,
allowing insurers to

45
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.726
analyze their claims data in
order to predict risk better.

46
00:03:36.726 --> 00:03:41.510
Of course, the historical data in the form

47
00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:47.060
of the history of losses may not be
the only data that are important

48
00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:53.030
in understanding how to price risk and
how to predict the risk.

49
00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.460
Insurers could create models to predict
demand for their own products and

50
00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:02.250
also develop new products, and
therefore understand how to price them,

51
00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.060
or determine their premium.

52
00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:12.180
Fraud, as you might expect, is a potential
problem in the insurance industry.

53
00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:17.400
Machine learning,
including analyzing pictures and

54
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.990
looking for certain markers of fraud,

55
00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:26.290
could both allow insurers to propagate
their business models better,

56
00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:31.670
but also potentially decrease costs
due to the dead weight loss of fraud.

57
00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:38.327
Those may be obvious to human adjusters,
but also, of course, it may not be.

58
00:04:38.327 --> 00:04:43.680
The automation of claims, which of course
could lead to happier policy holders,

59
00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:49.150
is another area where machine learning and
it's an efficiency and speed may apply,

60
00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:54.750
automating, reporting, processing, and
speeding along the customer experience.

61
00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.610
And finally, one of the most important
areas of insurance, underwriting.

62
00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:07.910
Underwriters are those human decision
makers who analyze data and,

63
00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:13.550
ultimately, make the decision of how to
take on a given risk, and how to price it.

64
00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.930
Computers can aid that
decision making process,

65
00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:23.250
they can flag risks in the process,
and they can also point out

66
00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.870
inconsistencies in data that human
underwriters may not be able to see.

67
00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:32.599
They can also check external sources,
like social media,

68
00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:35.351
to verify accuracy of input data.
