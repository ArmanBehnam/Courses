1
00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:06.990
So a number of different
approaches have emerged to

2
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.250
classifying insurtech firms based

3
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.385
on how the industry
itself is organized.

4
00:00:14.385 --> 00:00:16.320
I'm going to talk
about two of them;

5
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.230
one originating from
the Milken Institute,

6
00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.515
another originating
from Capgemini

7
00:00:22.515 --> 00:00:24.675
which is a well-known
consulting firm.

8
00:00:24.675 --> 00:00:29.295
Traditional view separates
the insurtech industry

9
00:00:29.295 --> 00:00:34.005
into full-stack agent and
brokerage components.

10
00:00:34.005 --> 00:00:37.160
Whereas the nuance view
which includes

11
00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.820
multiple sub-segments
puts them into

12
00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.520
three categories carriers which

13
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.340
is isomorphic to
full-stack providers,

14
00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.210
and then more subtly
enablers and distributors,

15
00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.660
which are not exactly
the same thing as agents and

16
00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.235
brokers but are a kind
of rotation of them.

17
00:00:58.235 --> 00:01:00.155
The latter model allows

18
00:01:00.155 --> 00:01:04.415
a significantly greater
level of subtlety.

19
00:01:04.415 --> 00:01:06.800
The traditional view of

20
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.050
full-stack insurance
agents and brokers

21
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.810
classifies insurtech firms first

22
00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.690
into platforms that
actually do underwriting.

23
00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:16.250
In other words, they make

24
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.580
the risk-taking decision
and then assume the risk,

25
00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.235
or perhaps could sell it off

26
00:01:22.235 --> 00:01:23.990
to or in the case

27
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.465
of an insurance company
to a reinsurance.

28
00:01:26.465 --> 00:01:30.470
But in most cases manages
from beginning to

29
00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.990
end the insurance
prospect gathering function,

30
00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.195
the underwriting,
the risk taking,

31
00:01:38.195 --> 00:01:43.710
then the policy maintenance,
and claims process.

32
00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.310
The agent component of

33
00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.540
the industry reflect platforms
or groups or companies

34
00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.325
that act on behalf of a carrier
essentially extending

35
00:01:55.325 --> 00:02:02.840
the carrier in the form of
client facing activity.

36
00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.930
Brokers specifically
provide customers

37
00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.050
with policies both by

38
00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.130
traditional carriers
and insurtech platforms

39
00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.150
that may be in the context
of being paid a commission,

40
00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.120
or maybe narrowing or

41
00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.185
broadening of a particular
area of insurance.

42
00:02:24.185 --> 00:02:26.870
Those brokerage
platforms could be for

43
00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.200
example online and short
tech approaches to

44
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.720
bring the traditional carriers to

45
00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.545
a conversation or to a customer
decision-making point,

46
00:02:36.545 --> 00:02:38.600
or it could include

47
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.460
both traditional and
insurtech providers or it

48
00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.500
could be only focused on

49
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.875
technologically enabled
insurtech platforms,

50
00:02:48.875 --> 00:02:51.380
allowing or providing

51
00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.340
various sorting
algorithms to provide

52
00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.250
customization or product or

53
00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.795
cost competition or
comparisons to clients.

54
00:03:02.795 --> 00:03:05.180
The simple classification.

55
00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.215
It asks whether a given firm
is a full insurance company,

56
00:03:09.215 --> 00:03:11.255
if it is we'll stop.

57
00:03:11.255 --> 00:03:13.354
If it is partnered

58
00:03:13.354 --> 00:03:15.890
with a given or multiple
insurance companies,

59
00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.615
if it's an agent stop or

60
00:03:17.615 --> 00:03:20.335
if it's more than one,
then it's a broker.

61
00:03:20.335 --> 00:03:26.890
Again a more nuanced view
categorizes elements of

62
00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.445
the insurance chain
by where they stand

63
00:03:30.445 --> 00:03:34.924
relative to distribution
as full carriers,

64
00:03:34.924 --> 00:03:38.110
distributors, or
enablers which can

65
00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.270
interact with full carries

66
00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:42.520
and distributors
at various points.

67
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:47.575
Full carriers as in the Milken
model could be digital.

68
00:03:47.575 --> 00:03:51.445
Or they could also be
P2P or micro insurers,

69
00:03:51.445 --> 00:03:53.290
where segmenting the market is

70
00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.560
inherent in the definition

71
00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.815
of the business model
of the company.

72
00:03:59.815 --> 00:04:02.320
Segmentation can
also be with respect

73
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.690
to customization of the product

74
00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.410
providing on-demand
insurance services

75
00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:12.740
as opposed to constant
insurance services.

76
00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.440
Distributors could be online

77
00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.680
or open architecture
marketplaces.

78
00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.400
They could be highly
customized with respect

79
00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.095
to customer demand
and characteristics,

80
00:04:26.095 --> 00:04:28.875
they could be digital
brokers themselves,

81
00:04:28.875 --> 00:04:31.005
or they could be B2B.

82
00:04:31.005 --> 00:04:34.655
Finally, enablers
could integrate into

83
00:04:34.655 --> 00:04:38.450
full carry or distributor
activities in the way

84
00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:42.965
they augment or improve

85
00:04:42.965 --> 00:04:45.755
or addressed
front office solutions,

86
00:04:45.755 --> 00:04:49.610
management of policies or claims,

87
00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.800
or help the full carries

88
00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.990
or distributors do
their jobs better,

89
00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.964
by way of augmenting or
harnessing the value of data,

90
00:04:57.964 --> 00:05:01.670
or specifics of technologies,

91
00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:04.295
drones for example as
we mentioned earlier.

92
00:05:04.295 --> 00:05:06.815
In other words, they're
either augmentative

93
00:05:06.815 --> 00:05:09.740
or disruptive with respect to

94
00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:14.585
the current distribution
value chain

95
00:05:14.585 --> 00:05:18.080
or a distribution
value chain itself.

96
00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.795
It's really three-dimensions
if you think about it.

97
00:05:20.795 --> 00:05:26.195
When looking at the three
insurtech platform types

98
00:05:26.195 --> 00:05:28.715
dis-aggregate gated
by product offering,

99
00:05:28.715 --> 00:05:32.525
Milken found a significant
amount of dispersion.

100
00:05:32.525 --> 00:05:37.830
For example, in the auto
health or life areas,

101
00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.560
the brokerage part of

102
00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:46.385
the FinTech platform space
was more popular.

103
00:05:46.385 --> 00:05:49.760
At least is more prevalent
in the world today.

104
00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:53.465
However when we look
at personal liability,

105
00:05:53.465 --> 00:05:57.200
business insurance
services related

106
00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.090
to financial planning
and retirement,

107
00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:01.295
endowment retirement and pension,

108
00:06:01.295 --> 00:06:06.590
we don't see the brokerage model
being as prevalent.

109
00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:09.305
Full-stack of course,
simply by the numbers,

110
00:06:09.305 --> 00:06:10.520
you might not expect to be as

111
00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.260
prevalent because
of its large scale.

112
00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:13.790
However, it is important to

113
00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:17.120
notice that except for
the financial planning area,

114
00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.140
Milken found that

115
00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:23.530
the full stack platform providers
were indeed everywhere.

116
00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:25.700
By way of prevalence again

117
00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:28.265
in the traditional areas,
auto, health,

118
00:06:28.265 --> 00:06:29.900
and life along with

119
00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:33.050
home rental insurance
title insurance and so on,

120
00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:36.065
the brokerage model,
the client-facing model

121
00:06:36.065 --> 00:06:38.150
is where much

122
00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:40.160
of the industry has been

123
00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.450
focusing at least if you

124
00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:43.880
look at the number of
product offerings.

125
00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:49.490
One issue with the three
platform description

126
00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:52.880
of the industry is that
a significant number

127
00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:54.920
of insurtech companies are really

128
00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:58.915
technology solution
providers focusing

129
00:06:58.915 --> 00:07:01.700
on at least three sub areas.

130
00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:04.830
First human resources
and benefits solutions,

131
00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:07.140
second data solutions,

132
00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:10.235
and third infrastructure
solutions.

133
00:07:10.235 --> 00:07:15.530
Those HR focused sub-segments
effectively focus

134
00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:18.950
on applying technology to

135
00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:20.750
help firms manage human capital

136
00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:23.075
more efficiently and
cost effectively.

137
00:07:23.075 --> 00:07:26.420
Those focusing on
data solutions are

138
00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:29.450
providing specialization
in collections

139
00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:33.260
and aggregating
vast data in order to

140
00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:37.340
support insurance or
reinsurance carriers

141
00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:41.455
and others to underwrite
risk or evaluate risk.

142
00:07:41.455 --> 00:07:44.255
Finally, infrastructure
providers focusing

143
00:07:44.255 --> 00:07:46.745
on processing things
more efficiently,

144
00:07:46.745 --> 00:07:49.415
and that can range from claims

145
00:07:49.415 --> 00:07:54.935
to underwriting to
client-facing activities,

146
00:07:54.935 --> 00:07:59.655
providing application
programming interfaces or APIs,

147
00:07:59.655 --> 00:08:04.380
supporting integration
or customization,

148
00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:07.875
both of products and services.

149
00:08:07.875 --> 00:08:10.800
As of a recent market to market,

150
00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:13.520
the number of providers in

151
00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:16.384
the infrastructure and
human resources areas

152
00:08:16.384 --> 00:08:18.125
dominated the margin,

153
00:08:18.125 --> 00:08:20.230
the number of
data solution providers.

154
00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:23.915
Our insurtech has induced

155
00:08:23.915 --> 00:08:25.970
a rapid expansion of

156
00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:29.255
the type of full
carriers that exist.

157
00:08:29.255 --> 00:08:33.710
Capgemini identified
a number of examples of

158
00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:35.425
the different kinds of

159
00:08:35.425 --> 00:08:39.645
insurtech firms that we
now see in the industry,

160
00:08:39.645 --> 00:08:41.535
in a very interesting way.

161
00:08:41.535 --> 00:08:44.450
For example, consider
now the existence

162
00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:47.405
of digital carriers which
follow traditional models,

163
00:08:47.405 --> 00:08:50.045
but are conducted
partially or totally

164
00:08:50.045 --> 00:08:55.130
online or using mobile
technology and app technology.

165
00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:58.040
Not just in US, Zhong Yan does

166
00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:01.565
the same thing for
property in China.

167
00:09:01.565 --> 00:09:03.815
P2P insurance or

168
00:09:03.815 --> 00:09:08.450
community-based insurance
where members of

169
00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:11.450
an exchange or a pool
put their money

170
00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:17.585
together to apply or to
distribute group coverage.

171
00:09:17.585 --> 00:09:21.170
Micro-insurance like the example

172
00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:23.735
below which we'll talk more
about in just a second,

173
00:09:23.735 --> 00:09:26.090
segmenting the market focusing

174
00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:30.390
on those who are closer to
the base of the pyramid.

175
00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:34.705
On-demand activities.

176
00:09:34.705 --> 00:09:38.360
Buying insurance as
opposed to every day,

177
00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:40.190
just on the days when you need

178
00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:42.520
them or usage-based in short.

179
00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:43.880
When you're engaged only in

180
00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:47.794
an activity as opposed to
along the dimension of time,

181
00:09:47.794 --> 00:09:51.530
providing insurance just
when you're engaged in

182
00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:56.150
the risky activity that
the insurance provides to.

183
00:09:56.150 --> 00:10:00.110
All of these examples are made

184
00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:02.300
possible by the application

185
00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:04.975
of technology in
one way or the other.

186
00:10:04.975 --> 00:10:07.795
Either through mobilization,

187
00:10:07.795 --> 00:10:12.045
the existence of
web-based solutions,

188
00:10:12.045 --> 00:10:15.260
or based on data that
can be analyzed in

189
00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.505
real time that are
finally dis-aggregated.

190
00:10:18.505 --> 00:10:20.800
Very challenging to do

191
00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:24.245
without the application
of insurtech technology.

192
00:10:24.245 --> 00:10:26.435
Many are familiar with

193
00:10:26.435 --> 00:10:30.470
the distribution methodology
of a marketplace online,

194
00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:36.170
essentially a site that allows
individuals or those who

195
00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:42.650
are signing up or using the
services to compare policies,

196
00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:48.485
products pricing across
potential providers.

197
00:10:48.485 --> 00:10:52.805
It's more of something
that you sign up for.

198
00:10:52.805 --> 00:10:54.385
It's a pull technology.

199
00:10:54.385 --> 00:10:55.490
A push technology or

200
00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:57.995
personal financial
assistant technology

201
00:10:57.995 --> 00:11:01.250
allows customers in
a highly customized format

202
00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:03.340
to manage policies,

203
00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:06.830
to receive recommendations on

204
00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:11.750
coverage on plans,
on characteristics,

205
00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:16.775
so that in a one-stop setting,

206
00:11:16.775 --> 00:11:19.820
the customer can optimize
their coverage and

207
00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:23.030
change it if the need arises.

208
00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:27.800
Digital brokers allow
direct comparisons

209
00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:29.780
and in some cases purchasing of

210
00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:32.785
policies, and then distribution,

211
00:11:32.785 --> 00:11:38.855
distributors typically
focused on commercial arenas,

212
00:11:38.855 --> 00:11:42.470
allow very technical comparisons

213
00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:44.755
for businesses that
have different needs.

214
00:11:44.755 --> 00:11:49.895
Finally, value-adding
intermediaries which

215
00:11:49.895 --> 00:11:54.245
are perhaps some of
the newest arrivals in

216
00:11:54.245 --> 00:11:57.260
insurtech are in

217
00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:00.920
a push technology using
techniques including

218
00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:05.660
social media platforms
to proactively connect

219
00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:07.820
potential customers who are

220
00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:12.075
similar in their
purchasing potential,

221
00:12:12.075 --> 00:12:14.385
their perspectives on insurance,

222
00:12:14.385 --> 00:12:18.120
and their insurance
needs to help them

223
00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:24.745
pull their payments or to
negotiate with carriers.

224
00:12:24.745 --> 00:12:28.010
Enablers addressed
the entire value chain from

225
00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:30.575
traditional carrier
activity through

226
00:12:30.575 --> 00:12:33.395
new arrival and
insurtech carriers.

227
00:12:33.395 --> 00:12:36.650
Either helping improve processes

228
00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:39.775
and solutions in
the front office,

229
00:12:39.775 --> 00:12:42.270
in policy and plan management,

230
00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:46.075
in claims management, in

231
00:12:46.075 --> 00:12:48.350
connecting data external as

232
00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:50.945
well as internal data
for carriers,

233
00:12:50.945 --> 00:12:54.785
or applying external
technology like drones

234
00:12:54.785 --> 00:13:01.525
and digital picture capture
and integrity verification.

235
00:13:01.525 --> 00:13:04.140
Enabling if you will,

236
00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:07.280
the traditional and
new activities of

237
00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:10.585
carriers and those along
the distribution value chain.

238
00:13:10.585 --> 00:13:12.800
So as you can see,
wherever we look in

239
00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:14.210
the distribution chain
and whether it's

240
00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:15.650
for full or stack,

241
00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:17.930
carriers, distributors
or enablers,

242
00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:21.785
insurtech is rapidly
infiltrating,

243
00:13:21.785 --> 00:13:25.400
supporting expanding
ultimately for

244
00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:27.500
the betterment of
the industry as well

245
00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:30.540
as the policy owner and

246
00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:34.715
the consumer,
the customer experience.

247
00:13:34.715 --> 00:13:37.970
It's no surprise
then that we see how

248
00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:41.585
rapidly the value of
the industry is expanding.

249
00:13:41.585 --> 00:13:43.890
That's what we'll
talk about next.
