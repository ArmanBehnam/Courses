1
00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:07.380
One of the most interesting
and gratifying areas that

2
00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.570
Ensure Tech has made
a difference in

3
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.120
perhaps fintech more broadly
has made a difference,

4
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.400
is that the so-called base
of the pyramid,

5
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.970
where technological
advancements have

6
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.460
allowed the reaching out to

7
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.015
markets that have traditionally
been underserved.

8
00:00:24.015 --> 00:00:26.520
The definition of
the base of the pyramid

9
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.320
some would say by the C.K.

10
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.010
Prahalad notion, four or
five or some would say

11
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:34.370
six billion people around
the world living on

12
00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.505
less than two dollars
equivalent per day,

13
00:00:37.505 --> 00:00:42.650
represent what
one US President described

14
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.325
as the great powerful mass

15
00:00:46.325 --> 00:00:48.790
at the base of
the economic pyramid.

16
00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.115
Those who are underserved,

17
00:00:51.115 --> 00:00:53.870
those who are challenged by

18
00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.575
the iron ring of
hostile environments,

19
00:00:57.575 --> 00:01:00.800
where direct insurance, which

20
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.570
could ensure away some

21
00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.415
of the risk is
the hostile environment,

22
00:01:04.415 --> 00:01:07.565
are either impractical, expensive

23
00:01:07.565 --> 00:01:12.370
or not profitable to provide.

24
00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.550
A leading example of
an enterprise focusing on

25
00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.340
the base of the pyramid
is the Omidyar Network,

26
00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.000
which was founded by
Pierre Omidyar in 2004.

27
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.930
Omidyar as many of you know
was the co-founder of eBay.

28
00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.580
It's interesting model and that's

29
00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.865
a non-profit profit
model that combines

30
00:01:30.865 --> 00:01:33.790
a for-profit limited
liability company with

31
00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.305
a 501(c)(3) organization in
the US that makes grants.

32
00:01:38.305 --> 00:01:41.500
It's either donated
or invested more than

33
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.700
$1.5 billion since its inception.

34
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.050
Almost half-half, $676 million of

35
00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:54.820
for-profit investments just
under $800 million in grants,

36
00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.965
targeting microfinance,

37
00:01:56.965 --> 00:01:59.840
microinsurance,
infrastructure and

38
00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.974
technologically enabled
activities focused

39
00:02:02.974 --> 00:02:05.540
again on the base of the pyramid,

40
00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.200
much of which could be
classified as fintech.

41
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.420
One example via investments in

42
00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.195
LeapFrog is specifically
microinsurance.

43
00:02:15.195 --> 00:02:19.235
Microinsurance is
the provision of

44
00:02:19.235 --> 00:02:23.035
insurance products or
services to low-income,

45
00:02:23.035 --> 00:02:26.105
low-net worth
population, who would

46
00:02:26.105 --> 00:02:28.070
otherwise have limited access to

47
00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.770
insurance but who have
tremendous needs.

48
00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.125
They could be exposed to

49
00:02:33.125 --> 00:02:36.590
challenging geopolitical
environments or histories,

50
00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.800
harsh physical
environments perhaps

51
00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.325
exposed to earthquakes,
pestilence,

52
00:02:44.325 --> 00:02:49.250
fires, volcanoes or
they could be exposed

53
00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.020
to geopolitical challenges
as well as poverty.

54
00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.170
The kinds of products that
have been provided by

55
00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.285
microinsurers range from
traditional term life policies,

56
00:03:02.285 --> 00:03:05.630
but also the kinds of
policies that focus on risks

57
00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.275
that are especially specific
to the base of the pyramid,

58
00:03:09.275 --> 00:03:12.410
namely accident insurance
and disability insurance,

59
00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.294
which if not otherwise provided,

60
00:03:16.294 --> 00:03:18.320
could see a family,

61
00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:25.075
highly exposed to a given wage
earners' physical health.

62
00:03:25.075 --> 00:03:29.270
Casualty insurance, insuring
crops and livestock,

63
00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:30.950
and insuring against
earthquakes and

64
00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.020
tsunamis and natural disasters.

65
00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:37.220
Even these days, expanding
to savings plans.

66
00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.690
The kinds of insurers
who are involved today

67
00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.630
are large multinational
insurance companies

68
00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.355
like Tokio Marine,

69
00:03:46.355 --> 00:03:49.115
credit unions or
other mutuals, governments,

70
00:03:49.115 --> 00:03:50.420
NGOs and also

71
00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.030
small community organizations
and regional insurers.

72
00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.080
The benefits of microinsurance
are traditional.

73
00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.240
The pooling of risk,

74
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.760
providing financial protection
in a traditional manner,

75
00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.630
but also allowing those
who are insured to take

76
00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:13.095
risks that provide
betterment in their life.

77
00:04:13.095 --> 00:04:15.590
For example, drought insurance,

78
00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.320
providing the ability
for small farmers to

79
00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.115
withstand the shock that would
otherwise wipe them out,

80
00:04:22.115 --> 00:04:27.115
who have natural exposure
to variation in weather,

81
00:04:27.115 --> 00:04:30.920
or safeguarding families
from falling back into

82
00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.530
poverty from the death
of a breadwinner

83
00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.815
or having a destroyed house.

84
00:04:36.815 --> 00:04:39.365
The Indian Ministry
of Health found that

85
00:04:39.365 --> 00:04:42.800
25 percent of
all hospitalization in

86
00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.320
India pushed
individual or families

87
00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.175
into poverty due to
the cost of treatment.

88
00:04:49.175 --> 00:04:52.520
We could also target
specific populations.

89
00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.575
For example, in South Africa,

90
00:04:55.575 --> 00:04:57.710
All Life which is
a subdivision of

91
00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:59.990
Sanlam has focused on providing

92
00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.710
insurance to those who are
already HIV positive or

93
00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:08.630
those living in flood zones
or to micro-entrepreneurs.

94
00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.970
Microinsurance is also valuable,

95
00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:12.184
because it can complement

96
00:05:12.184 --> 00:05:14.480
other social welfare programs or

97
00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.740
bolster other so-called
micro-finance activities.

98
00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.210
For example,
the ability to assign

99
00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:21.800
a term life policy to secure

100
00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.820
a business or a mortgage loan.

101
00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:28.025
A very interesting
example is BIMA,

102
00:05:28.025 --> 00:05:30.395
which is an "Insurtech" leader

103
00:05:30.395 --> 00:05:33.005
and some would say
an insurance business disruptor,

104
00:05:33.005 --> 00:05:36.080
it's a mobile insurance
and health company

105
00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.090
that provides accident,

106
00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:40.170
life and health insurance to

107
00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:45.720
low-income population
members in 15 African,

108
00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.745
Asian and Latin
American countries,

109
00:05:48.745 --> 00:05:53.305
with its largest markets
in Ghana and Sri Lanka.

110
00:05:53.305 --> 00:05:56.060
How does it do it? It provides

111
00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.420
insurance underwriting
and customer interaction

112
00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:01.880
using mobile technology.

113
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.790
Microinsurance subscriptions
via cell phones.

114
00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:09.150
The BIMA business model is

115
00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:12.290
a "pay-as-you-go"
subscription model,

116
00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:16.315
enabled by mobile
phone technology.

117
00:06:16.315 --> 00:06:20.140
The products which can
cost as little as $0.60 a

118
00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:24.025
month in the "pay-as-you
go" rollover approach,

119
00:06:24.025 --> 00:06:25.645
offers payouts up to a

120
00:06:25.645 --> 00:06:30.080
$1,000 to a family if
the insured person dies.

121
00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.610
It's a streamline model,

122
00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:34.480
takes only three
minutes to sign up,

123
00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:37.795
and the payments are
collected through

124
00:06:37.795 --> 00:06:44.405
mobile phone services using
local country technology.

125
00:06:44.405 --> 00:06:47.850
Recently, BIMA has
indicated that it

126
00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:52.080
has grown by over 550,000

127
00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.430
customers a month and that

128
00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:57.020
the overwhelming majority of

129
00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:00.875
those customers live on
less than $10 a day.

130
00:07:00.875 --> 00:07:03.560
In fact, three-quarters
of them have

131
00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.820
never had insurance before.

132
00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:12.665
Executives at BIMA
tell us that one major

133
00:07:12.665 --> 00:07:15.110
component that their offering is

134
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:18.939
educating customers on
how life insurance works,

135
00:07:18.939 --> 00:07:22.520
because many of them had
simply never been exposed to

136
00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:26.930
it and faced a trust gap.

137
00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:29.539
Because they've
never been exposed,

138
00:07:29.539 --> 00:07:31.630
they didn't think it worked.

139
00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:34.720
They needed to be
shown by example.

140
00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:39.755
BIMA recently received
a $300 million valuation

141
00:07:39.755 --> 00:07:42.670
at the sale of
LeapFrog stake to Allianz,

142
00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:46.965
the European insurer, for
almost a $100 million.

143
00:07:46.965 --> 00:07:49.190
There are some
subtle differences,

144
00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:50.240
when we consider what

145
00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:53.240
the incumbents have been
doing with respect to

146
00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:57.320
investment around
the globe or with

147
00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:01.880
respect to maturity of
investment they've been making.

148
00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:04.565
Clearly in the last five years,

149
00:08:04.565 --> 00:08:07.460
technology developed
in the United States

150
00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:09.155
has led the fray.

151
00:08:09.155 --> 00:08:14.015
54 percent of private
technology investments

152
00:08:14.015 --> 00:08:18.725
by insurers themselves have
focused on the United States.

153
00:08:18.725 --> 00:08:20.825
That has been
diversifying however,

154
00:08:20.825 --> 00:08:22.415
compared to the last five years.

155
00:08:22.415 --> 00:08:24.480
For example, in
the last five years,

156
00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:27.710
54 percent of private
technology investment

157
00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:30.080
by incumbents has been in
the United States whereas,

158
00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:31.520
in the fourth quarter of 2018,

159
00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.460
only 33 percent has been.

160
00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:35.700
21 percent was in China,

161
00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:37.140
13 percent in Germany and

162
00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:40.845
13 percent in the UK
compared to 8,

163
00:08:40.845 --> 00:08:44.675
8, and 6 over
the last five years.

164
00:08:44.675 --> 00:08:50.935
In other words, we see
a rapid internationalization of

165
00:08:50.935 --> 00:08:54.530
investment targeting
by those who are

166
00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:58.565
moving quickly to ramp
up as incumbents.

167
00:08:58.565 --> 00:09:01.970
We also see that they
are investing further

168
00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:05.855
along the life cycle of
the company's targeted.

169
00:09:05.855 --> 00:09:12.145
Only 16 percent of investments
were Seed or Angel stage,

170
00:09:12.145 --> 00:09:14.730
whereas 29 and 24 percent

171
00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:17.300
respectfully were
Series A or Series B.

172
00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:20.285
It's not that surprising
that incumbents

173
00:09:20.285 --> 00:09:23.440
are outsourcing
technological development.

174
00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:24.950
Now, we can see that trend

175
00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:26.920
continuing the most
recent time period,

176
00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:28.845
when 35 percent of

177
00:09:28.845 --> 00:09:30.290
targeted investments fell into

178
00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:32.605
the Series B classification.

179
00:09:32.605 --> 00:09:35.270
This is a pattern that we
