1
00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:05.475
Okay. We're now going
to take a look at

2
00:00:05.475 --> 00:00:08.220
a specialty area of
Fintech known as

3
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.680
insurtech or the application of

4
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.970
various kinds of technologies
in the insurance industry.

5
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:20.190
The insurance industry
is huge, it's global,

6
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:26.760
it's diversified across
applications and subsegments.

7
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.105
According to some
recent calibrations,

8
00:00:30.105 --> 00:00:32.405
Gross Written Premium stood at an

9
00:00:32.405 --> 00:00:36.735
almost $5 trillion
at the end of 2017.

10
00:00:36.735 --> 00:00:40.520
Gross Written Premium is
essentially the amount of

11
00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.980
insurance written not including

12
00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.090
commissions and some costs.

13
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.445
That premier is growing
fastest in emerging markets.

14
00:00:49.445 --> 00:00:51.785
Net income was estimated by

15
00:00:51.785 --> 00:00:54.170
Ernst &Young to have
grown 23 percent in

16
00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:00.040
2018 versus 14 percent in 2017.

17
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.930
Now, the insurance industry is

18
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.880
a very old and traditional
industry, in fact,

19
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.860
some say contracts that
help people insure

20
00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.745
various risks go back as
many as thousands of years.

21
00:01:16.745 --> 00:01:19.355
It's clear, however, that

22
00:01:19.355 --> 00:01:23.150
the advent of modern
technologies is changing and

23
00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.275
even some would say disrupting
this stayed industry

24
00:01:27.275 --> 00:01:32.120
via all kinds of
methodologies and mediums.

25
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.500
Wearables, driverless vehicles,

26
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.875
IoT or the Internet of Things,

27
00:01:37.875 --> 00:01:41.880
Big Data, natural language
processing, blockchain,

28
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.260
distributed ledger technologies,

29
00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.835
even the possibility of

30
00:01:46.835 --> 00:01:49.490
climate change
affecting those who

31
00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.300
are insured along with
many others are adding up

32
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.500
through the avenues of

33
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.355
technology to serve as
a disrupting force.

34
00:01:58.355 --> 00:02:02.330
New technologies are also
offering all kinds of

35
00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.985
potential opportunities to do

36
00:02:04.985 --> 00:02:06.680
today's business better in

37
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.470
the industry or to grow markets,

38
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.140
to make better
decisions and address

39
00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.520
what we could call
the customer experience,

40
00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.930
all coming together as insurtech.

41
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.525
Now, there is no standardized
definition of insurtech.

42
00:02:23.525 --> 00:02:25.700
Some would say that even though

43
00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.530
it's disrupting and
revolutionizing

44
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.570
the industry and rapidly

45
00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.140
today already changing
the way insurers,

46
00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.530
service providers, and ultimately

47
00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.465
customers experience insurance.

48
00:02:39.465 --> 00:02:41.465
There is no standard definition.

49
00:02:41.465 --> 00:02:44.485
I like the definition
that SIA put together.

50
00:02:44.485 --> 00:02:46.140
InsurTech can be described as,

51
00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.860
"An insurance company,
intermediary,

52
00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.320
or value chain segment
component that

53
00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.840
utilizes technology to compete

54
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.430
will provide better benefits,

55
00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.290
value-added benefits
in the industry."

56
00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.950
Now, the ecosystem
of technologies that

57
00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.765
are coming to play in the
insurance industry are many,

58
00:03:08.765 --> 00:03:11.870
some of which you've
already probably been

59
00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.420
exposed to like blockchain.

60
00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.435
Efficient information
exchange, trust,

61
00:03:19.435 --> 00:03:20.780
the ability to write

62
00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.180
contracts that are
self-referential and

63
00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.060
self-aware and which offer

64
00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.100
a certain kind of immutability,

65
00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.500
ultimately appropriate
because after

66
00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.685
all insurance is essentially
in the form of a contract.

67
00:03:34.685 --> 00:03:38.500
Analytics that help insurers,

68
00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.745
their service providers,
underwriters,

69
00:03:41.745 --> 00:03:44.190
and others make better decisions,

70
00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.335
taking more from data,

71
00:03:46.335 --> 00:03:50.190
expanding to new data,
augmenting data.

72
00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.445
The insurance industry and

73
00:03:52.445 --> 00:03:55.775
the processing of
insurance requires

74
00:03:55.775 --> 00:03:58.775
vast amounts of repetitive tasks

75
00:03:58.775 --> 00:04:02.375
making insurance ripe
for process automation.

76
00:04:02.375 --> 00:04:07.665
Rules-based or potentially
ultimately self-aware,

77
00:04:07.665 --> 00:04:13.560
increasing reliability,
decreasing mistakes,

78
00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.115
and ultimately automating what

79
00:04:16.115 --> 00:04:20.855
traditionally has been
a human task oriented area.

80
00:04:20.855 --> 00:04:24.575
Robo advisors who
rely on rules or

81
00:04:24.575 --> 00:04:26.540
other kinds of machine learning

82
00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.554
techniques to interact
with customers,

83
00:04:29.554 --> 00:04:33.575
it could be customers
interacting with

84
00:04:33.575 --> 00:04:39.150
technology online or over
the phone either enhancing,

85
00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:40.480
making more immediate or

86
00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.675
more accurate customer
interactions.

87
00:04:43.675 --> 00:04:47.390
A very interesting area
known as wearables,

88
00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:52.690
providing data both about
the insured or those who are

89
00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:55.120
related to the insured
all the way back

90
00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.549
to insurers helping
them manage risks,

91
00:04:58.549 --> 00:05:02.135
understanding the insured,

92
00:05:02.135 --> 00:05:05.965
perhaps improving
the customer experience

93
00:05:05.965 --> 00:05:09.260
in real-time or in
aggregated way.

94
00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:12.970
Connecting ecosystems which
could be, by the way,

95
00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:15.445
as broad and far-reaching as

96
00:05:15.445 --> 00:05:18.880
social media or based
on data already

97
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.010
collected within
the ecosystem of the

98
00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:23.930
insured linking back to

99
00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.545
the entire value chain
of insurance.

100
00:05:26.545 --> 00:05:29.240
Understanding the client
better to better

101
00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.020
profile their risks
and potentially spot

102
00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.000
both service lapses and

103
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.175
rising risks in a more accurate
way or in a faster way.

104
00:05:40.175 --> 00:05:43.430
Technologies like
drone technologies

105
00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:48.185
or visual processing
technologies,

106
00:05:48.185 --> 00:05:52.840
using for aerial imagery,
remote assessment,

107
00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:57.080
and integrity of images
and imagery used in

108
00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:02.335
the insurance underwriting
process or for claims.

109
00:06:02.335 --> 00:06:04.845
Artificial intelligence, AI,

110
00:06:04.845 --> 00:06:07.120
including natural
language processing,

111
00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.170
mimicking the human capacity to

112
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:12.565
process language, to learn,

113
00:06:12.565 --> 00:06:15.050
to extract patterns not easily

114
00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.720
seen using traditional
technologies including

115
00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.450
even advanced statistics and

116
00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:24.770
ultimately making
a customer's experience

117
00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:28.290
and an insurers decision-making
process better.
