1
00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:05.190
A useful model for how Insurtech

2
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.250
can influence
the entire value chain

3
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.660
of the insurance industry,

4
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.005
breaks it up into five pieces.

5
00:00:13.005 --> 00:00:17.475
Product-oriented,
selling and marketing,

6
00:00:17.475 --> 00:00:21.390
risk taking or underwriting,
administering,

7
00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.020
servicing clients and policies,

8
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.345
and then claims and
claims management

9
00:00:27.345 --> 00:00:31.140
or paying out on
insurance claims.

10
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.740
The product design component
is multifaceted.

11
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:41.600
First of all, it starts with

12
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.485
the customer experience
and understanding

13
00:00:44.485 --> 00:00:49.225
customer's insurance needs
and risk management needs.

14
00:00:49.225 --> 00:00:52.775
The customer
experience ultimately

15
00:00:52.775 --> 00:00:56.665
leads to questions in
identification of market segments,

16
00:00:56.665 --> 00:01:00.915
as well as questions
of customization.

17
00:01:00.915 --> 00:01:05.075
Can an insurer or an element

18
00:01:05.075 --> 00:01:09.035
of the insurance
ecosystem provide

19
00:01:09.035 --> 00:01:10.700
a better experience to clients

20
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.860
by understanding the needs they

21
00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.665
have for risk management
across their lives,

22
00:01:17.665 --> 00:01:19.470
whether it has to
do with their cars,

23
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.265
their homes, their lives,
their financial future?

24
00:01:23.265 --> 00:01:26.145
Then can we customize it?

25
00:01:26.145 --> 00:01:30.330
Can the industry
design new products?

26
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.480
Can it adjust the product
offerings in real-time?

27
00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:41.060
Can it disaggregate the product
mix both in time and in

28
00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.140
the cross-section of the

29
00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.895
insured to provide what
is most valuable to them,

30
00:01:46.895 --> 00:01:49.340
and can they do it seamlessly,

31
00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.840
can they do it quickly,

32
00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.165
and can they do it dynamically?

33
00:01:55.165 --> 00:01:57.405
Designing and delivering products

34
00:01:57.405 --> 00:01:59.640
to the end customer they want.

35
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.960
Marketing distribution
and the management

36
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.165
of sales of course,

37
00:02:05.165 --> 00:02:07.655
could be augmented by

38
00:02:07.655 --> 00:02:11.970
extending the ability
to reach the client,

39
00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.405
integrating different
client touch points,

40
00:02:16.405 --> 00:02:20.565
providing real-time
interactions with clients,

41
00:02:20.565 --> 00:02:23.895
not just pull but push.

42
00:02:23.895 --> 00:02:28.025
Identification of
cross-selling opportunities

43
00:02:28.025 --> 00:02:31.760
known as the wallet
share for clients,

44
00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.100
and that could link
back to concepts of

45
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.314
financial planning as
we've heard elsewhere,

46
00:02:37.314 --> 00:02:40.760
or it could be very
specific to insurance.

47
00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.254
Detecting client happiness
levels and satisfaction,

48
00:02:45.254 --> 00:02:48.580
providing increased
price transparency,

49
00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.960
supporting customization
as well as

50
00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.660
competition, and
appropriate pricing.

51
00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:00.890
Underwriting, the ability
to capture information,

52
00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.470
provide rapid feedback
to clients on

53
00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.080
their insurability and
the pricing of insurance.

54
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:10.940
Understanding clients
beyond the data

55
00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.530
they provide on an application.

56
00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.850
Automating workflow so that

57
00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.975
the task of underwriting
is made most efficient,

58
00:03:19.975 --> 00:03:25.005
ultimately tying back
to client experience.

59
00:03:25.005 --> 00:03:27.650
Being able to gather
data to offer

60
00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:33.570
real-time discounts and
couponing the clients.

61
00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.855
Getting behind the client eyes

62
00:03:36.855 --> 00:03:39.250
and understanding their behavior,

63
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.030
ultimately to provide

64
00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.515
a better underwriting experience
and risk-management.

65
00:03:45.515 --> 00:03:50.500
Post underwriting and
premium generation,

66
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.630
policy administration
or the acquisition

67
00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.425
and servicing of
a policy comes to bear.

68
00:03:57.425 --> 00:04:00.290
Servicing after acquisition of

69
00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.140
insurance policies really is

70
00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.845
the area where insurers are
in touch with their clients.

71
00:04:06.845 --> 00:04:09.110
Post-acquisition,

72
00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:12.649
the servicing element
of clients is often

73
00:04:12.649 --> 00:04:15.275
monetized in the spirit of

74
00:04:15.275 --> 00:04:17.000
the best clients being

75
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.640
an insurance company's
best clients.

76
00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.250
The ability to again segment

77
00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.950
the market with respect
to their desires for

78
00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.610
servicing characteristics
like self servicing

79
00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.150
or servicing at
all hours of the day,

80
00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.930
as well as things like
automated reminders to pay,

81
00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:39.755
and sending out renewal notices

82
00:04:39.755 --> 00:04:42.710
or updates with life events,

83
00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:45.680
and again connecting
back to financial plans.

84
00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.605
All are ripe areas

85
00:04:48.605 --> 00:04:52.425
for Insurtech to improve
the client experience.

86
00:04:52.425 --> 00:04:57.090
Finally, servicing and
paying out of claims.

87
00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.480
The servicing and paying out

88
00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.975
of claims once they've been filed

89
00:05:01.975 --> 00:05:04.655
is in fact the point at which

90
00:05:04.655 --> 00:05:07.820
many see insurance as
being most valuable.

91
00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.415
In other words,
the point at which

92
00:05:10.415 --> 00:05:13.010
they think of their insurance
companies historically is

93
00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:16.145
when the writer writing
a premium checked or

94
00:05:16.145 --> 00:05:21.130
they are requesting
or filing a claim.

95
00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:23.630
The ability to lower
wait times and improve

96
00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:24.920
the customer experience as

97
00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:27.770
a result of technological
transformation,

98
00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.230
holds a great promise
in the ecosystem

99
00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:32.375
of the insurance industry

100
00:05:32.375 --> 00:05:34.055
with respect to their insurance.

101
00:05:34.055 --> 00:05:39.484
That could range from
notification of claims,

102
00:05:39.484 --> 00:05:44.080
the ability to submit
digital evidence,

103
00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.504
the electronic filing
of claim forms,

104
00:05:47.504 --> 00:05:51.990
status monitoring and analytics,

105
00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:55.650
identifying fraud and
fraudulent claims.

106
00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:56.940
Ultimately, potentially lowering

107
00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.250
the cost for all insured.
