1
00:00:04.412 --> 00:00:08.161
One of the most exciting
things in insurance today, but

2
00:00:08.161 --> 00:00:12.789
also something I suspect has some
in the industry fairly terrified,

3
00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:15.650
is how rapidly Insurtech is growing.

4
00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.080
And becoming not just a maybe but
a must for current carriers,

5
00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:25.890
current distributors,
current enablers as money has flowed in.

6
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.520
And the possibilities,

7
00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:33.120
the dreams that Insurtech represents
have become closer to reality.

8
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.870
Now, getting a handle on the size of
the market is a bit of a challenge.

9
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.610
However, what seems to be clear
is that it's large and growing.

10
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.650
For example, one recent estimate of
the size of the industry, this is in 2018,

11
00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:52.370
is that revenue was already
about half a billion dollars.

12
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.210
And that is a significant number if we
consider the growth of the industry,

13
00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.350
which we'll show you in just a second,
from just a couple of years ago.

14
00:01:00.442 --> 00:01:06.000
Some have suggested that the cumulative
growth rates over the next five years

15
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.349
will see it reach about $1.2
billion in revenues by 2023.

16
00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.689
Across the world,
the AsiaPacific, or APAC,

17
00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.166
regions will likely have
the greatest growth rate,

18
00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:25.761
in part because of the growth in
financial hubs like Singapore and

19
00:01:25.761 --> 00:01:29.034
Hong Kong, Mumbai, and elsewhere.

20
00:01:29.034 --> 00:01:33.974
And in fact,
the sub-segment of health insurance is

21
00:01:33.974 --> 00:01:39.373
expected to have the highest growth rate,
again by some.

22
00:01:39.373 --> 00:01:45.010
Others have suggested that the industry
is growing by the metrics of investments.

23
00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:51.880
2017 total Insurtech investments
surmounted $3 billion,

24
00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:57.570
with about 200 deals having
been done during the year.

25
00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:03.940
Over 80% of those involved insurer or
reinsurer making the investment.

26
00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.535
So industry natives investing
in technological advancements in

27
00:02:08.535 --> 00:02:12.050
the industry at some point
along the value chain.

28
00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:21.881
The estimates for that level of investment
was forecasted to be a 45% growth rate.

29
00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.530
In terms of the market for corporate
control, as well as venture capital and

30
00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.170
private equity investments,
you can see dramatic growth.

31
00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.739
From 2013, and
just about 90 deals having been done,

32
00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:41.555
to 2017 and
just under 260 deals being done.

33
00:02:41.555 --> 00:02:46.790
Recent private investment seems
to have peaked in 2016, but

34
00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.227
still remains substantial at
just under $6 billion in 2018.

35
00:02:52.227 --> 00:02:57.689
When we drill down both by segment and
by geography into some of these numbers,

36
00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:00.916
we see that really is a global phenomenon,
and

37
00:03:00.916 --> 00:03:04.890
also is not just health
insurance phenomenon.

38
00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:10.485
Now, although we saw a slight decline
in global private investment, M&A, and

39
00:03:10.485 --> 00:03:16.255
investment activity from venture capitals
and private equity firms in the last year.

40
00:03:16.255 --> 00:03:19.555
If you look at a little bit longer
horizon, comparing 2015 to 2017,

41
00:03:19.555 --> 00:03:24.325
the number of starups has
absolutely skyrocketed.

42
00:03:24.325 --> 00:03:29.686
According to SMA,
we count something like 50 in 2015.

43
00:03:29.686 --> 00:03:37.330
Or as we now count, almost 1,200
at some point launching in 2017.

44
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:42.740
AXA, the global insurance company,

45
00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:48.660
identifies at least six
different areas of disruption

46
00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.757
for the insurance industry
in its Insurtech entrance.

47
00:03:53.757 --> 00:03:58.857
Mobile platforms,
home office connectivity, P2P,

48
00:03:58.857 --> 00:04:04.066
and sharing economies,
connected health blockchain,

49
00:04:04.066 --> 00:04:10.586
connected cars and so on IoT,
all disrupting the insurance industry.

50
00:04:10.586 --> 00:04:18.578
Mobile platforms allowing products
to be distributed, bought, and sold.

51
00:04:18.578 --> 00:04:23.186
Home offices and
homes in general connecting back to

52
00:04:23.186 --> 00:04:27.376
the kind of information aggregation that,
for

53
00:04:27.376 --> 00:04:32.403
example, property and
casualty insurance might like,

54
00:04:32.403 --> 00:04:36.610
for example,
monitoring the status of a home.

55
00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.840
Take connected health,
being able to isolate

56
00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.726
people's bodily functions or
state of their being.

57
00:04:45.726 --> 00:04:50.849
Or take connected cars being
able to reroute traffic and

58
00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:53.792
understand traffic patterns,

59
00:04:53.792 --> 00:04:58.599
where the ability to drive
more safely might arise.

60
00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:02.030
And of course,
blockchain with data privacy and

61
00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:06.750
data integrity at the heart
of the insurance industry.

62
00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:11.680
An adjunct to these trends
in Insurtech is the movement

63
00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.320
of business processes, data aggregation
sharing, and so on, to the cloud.

64
00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:23.085
From a recent survey from Ovum,
the increase in software as a service,

65
00:05:23.085 --> 00:05:28.157
SaaS, really most of it in the cloud,
grew from about

66
00:05:28.157 --> 00:05:33.367
13% in 2016 to 26%, doubling in 2018.

67
00:05:33.367 --> 00:05:38.558
What they identify at around the same
order of magnitude is claims,

68
00:05:38.558 --> 00:05:43.203
systems, processing data,
fraud detection systems, and

69
00:05:43.203 --> 00:05:49.680
customer relation management and
marketing systems all moving to the cloud.

70
00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:54.433
Embracing, perhaps some would
say by necessity, this new

71
00:05:54.433 --> 00:06:00.400
modus of cloud-based
software as a service.

72
00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:05.590
And of course with the advent of ongoing
data sharing, aggregation, collection,

73
00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:11.540
and dissemination,
its integrity is on everyone's mind.

74
00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:16.260
Blockchain has as good an application
in insurance as anywhere else.

75
00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:17.342
So we can see examples.

76
00:06:17.342 --> 00:06:22.331
AIA Hong Kong recently launched
an application to share very private

77
00:06:22.331 --> 00:06:26.804
life insurance policy data with
its distribution chain using

78
00:06:26.804 --> 00:06:30.270
blockchain secrecy technology.

79
00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:34.660
The insurance company AXA in
Europe offers specific insurance,

80
00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:41.020
flight delay insurance, organized on a
blockchain platform with smart contracts.

81
00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:45.340
Ovum's annual survey again
highlighting the growth in the space.

82
00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:50.300
Carriers and consortiums,
collections of carriers,

83
00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:55.133
are almost surely going to increase the
use of blockchain along the entire value

84
00:06:55.133 --> 00:06:59.333
spectrum in insurance because of
concerns around data technology.

85
00:06:59.333 --> 00:07:04.330
And what it provides for the ability to,
in real time, aggregate,

86
00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:10.360
dissemination, and change contracts
to be specific and customized.

87
00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:16.007
For example, in the fourth quarter
of 2018, over 63 Insurtech

88
00:07:16.007 --> 00:07:22.630
deals were announced in the United States
at about 1.6 billion in value.

89
00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:29.959
Compared to one year before that,
that was a 24% increase in deal count and

90
00:07:29.959 --> 00:07:35.160
an increase in funding
volume by just under 160%.

91
00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:41.510
Those 63 transactions surmounted
those in the third quarter but

92
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:43.580
were lower than in Q1 and Q2.

93
00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:49.257
Around the globe,
in the UK we saw some variation,

94
00:07:49.257 --> 00:07:53.843
down 9% from the previous
quarter with China being

95
00:07:53.843 --> 00:07:58.338
the second largest investor
after US based flows.

96
00:07:58.338 --> 00:08:05.091
Since 2012, UK has been responsible for
under 10% of total investments.

97
00:08:05.091 --> 00:08:06.022
That have been said,

98
00:08:06.022 --> 00:08:08.830
investment from international
markets still remains strong.

99
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:15.130
X, US transactions represent just
under 50% about 43% of total

100
00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:21.444
transactions since 2012 and just under
60% since the fourth quarter of 2018.

101
00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:26.423
Very early stage investing remain strong,

102
00:08:26.423 --> 00:08:30.250
which makes these numbers
even more imppressive.

103
00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:36.802
Very early or seed stage investments
as well as first post seed round,

104
00:08:36.802 --> 00:08:42.919
known as series A, account for just under
65% of total transactions since 2012.

105
00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:47.256
In addition Insurtech funding is maturing.

106
00:08:47.256 --> 00:08:52.223
Mid and
later stages were about 45% of financing

107
00:08:52.223 --> 00:08:56.720
in 2018 via series A, B, or C stages.

108
00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:59.301
We'll see what happens next, but

109
00:08:59.301 --> 00:09:03.846
it's reasonable to expect
consolidation as time moves on.

110
00:09:03.846 --> 00:09:10.227
Across segments P&C, otherwise known
as property and casualty insurance,

111
00:09:10.227 --> 00:09:17.490
increased its funding volume by just
under 60% in 2018, Q3 and Q4 up by 90%.

112
00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:22.192
That marked 41 property
casualty transactions.

113
00:09:22.192 --> 00:09:25.715
Just a little higher than
the 40 transactions in Q3, but

114
00:09:25.715 --> 00:09:28.980
a 52% increase over the prior year.

115
00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:29.750
Life and health,

116
00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:34.540
as we mentioned earlier, one of
the largest areas of Insurtech focus.

117
00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:42.044
That was a 362% increase from
the fourth quarter of 2017.

118
00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:49.270
Deal count increased
overall by 10% from Q3 and

119
00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:52.200
funding volume increased by 26%.

120
00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:53.690
Again in life and health.

121
00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:59.290
To get a bit of a more of a refined
view of the time series pattern,

122
00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:03.720
take a look at CB Insights
historical record.

123
00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:07.600
For funding volume across all
stages here going back to 2012,

124
00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:11.480
when really this is a life and
health arena,

125
00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:16.250
with the exception perhaps of
the second quarter of 2012.

126
00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:20.860
As time moves on, you can see property and
casualty came to the game.

127
00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:26.230
And we see dramatic growth
across the entire industry.

128
00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:29.463
You don't need a regression model but
perhaps could use

129
00:10:29.463 --> 00:10:33.745
the ocular technique to see perhaps
a structural break around 2015.

130
00:10:33.745 --> 00:10:38.056
And then ever increasing
funding volume reaching that

131
00:10:38.056 --> 00:10:42.680
$1.6 billion mark in
the fourth quarter of 2018.

132
00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:46.170
The geographic detail
points out a couple things.

133
00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:51.930
First, the United States,
over the previous five years, represents

134
00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:59.520
the greatest preponderance of
transactions by way of target country.

135
00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:06.542
That seemed to be true in
the fourth quarter of 2018,

136
00:11:06.542 --> 00:11:10.092
as well as over the last five years.

137
00:11:10.092 --> 00:11:13.903
The UK, China, and Germany,
followed by India and France,

138
00:11:13.903 --> 00:11:18.420
represent the remaining top players,
again by target country.

139
00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:23.020
And the ordering remains fairly
constant in the last quarter of 2018.

140
00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:28.440
With respect to stage of the investment,
what we saw on the last five years,

141
00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:35.080
namely that seed and
angel rounds were larger by

142
00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:41.110
comparison to Series A, also remained
true in the fourth quarter of 2018,

143
00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:45.750
with Series B and
Series C being dramatically smaller.

144
00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:52.385
When we look at the pattern
of Insurtech transaction

145
00:11:52.385 --> 00:11:56.723
by investment stage over
the last five years,

146
00:11:56.723 --> 00:12:01.729
we see that the seed an angel
stage financing was by far

147
00:12:01.729 --> 00:12:07.196
the largest component,
followed by series A, B, and C.

148
00:12:07.196 --> 00:12:12.940
That pattern remain true in the most
recent data from fourth quarter of 2018.

149
00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:19.001
Again, the later stage financing,
Series D, E, and so on, and

150
00:12:19.001 --> 00:12:24.090
later stages, have not yet
ramped up in the industry.

151
00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:25.174
Which makes sense,

152
00:12:25.174 --> 00:12:28.620
given the pattern across time that
we saw in the previous graph.

153
00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:37.080
It also, again, raises the possibility
of consolidation as companies and

154
00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:44.853
efforts move through the various stages
of maturity in this part of the industry.

155
00:12:44.853 --> 00:12:49.022
An important question that you
might be wondering about is what

156
00:12:49.022 --> 00:12:51.680
the incumbents are doing.

157
00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:54.980
That's an interesting question
to ask in all industries.

158
00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:57.070
If we're thinking about startups or

159
00:12:57.070 --> 00:13:01.650
disruptors affecting an industry,
we look at the data we just did.

160
00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:06.310
If were thinking about what the insurance
industry itself has been doing,

161
00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:10.591
we can look at private technology
investment by those firms.

162
00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:16.358
If we look at the pattern across
time of incumbent investment,

163
00:13:16.358 --> 00:13:21.107
we see that it was essentially
nascent if we go back to 2012.

164
00:13:21.107 --> 00:13:25.390
We only saw one, essentially
one deal in the fourth quarter.

165
00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:28.261
However, by 2014 we saw just under 30.

166
00:13:28.261 --> 00:13:32.777
By 2015 we saw 66, and then by 2017 and

167
00:13:32.777 --> 00:13:36.420
2018 we saw almost a 120 deals.

168
00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:41.161
Another way to interpret this is that
outside disruption was putting pressure,

169
00:13:41.161 --> 00:13:44.659
and has been putting pressure,
on insurance incumbents.

170
00:13:44.659 --> 00:13:48.416
And insurance incumbents,
by acquisition or by direct investment,

171
00:13:48.416 --> 00:13:50.410
have now joined the party.

172
00:13:50.410 --> 00:13:55.560
Again, the question wasn't if,
but when the current incumbents

173
00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:58.970
invested or
purchased into the FinTech space.

174
00:13:58.970 --> 00:14:01.730
And I think you're going to be seeing that

175
00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:04.460
continue to increase
as time moves forward.
