00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:09.870
Again, it's useful to
consider what recent startups

2
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.390
look like to get a sense of

3
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.885
disruption versus
incremental advantage.

4
00:00:15.885 --> 00:00:17.820
Take for example Blend.

5
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.580
Blend is a cloud-based
software firm

6
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.215
based in San Francisco,

7
00:00:22.215 --> 00:00:25.320
which essentially allows those

8
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.270
who are seeking
mortgages applicants to

9
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.790
share financial data
with lenders to cut

10
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.939
down on the dead weight
cost of approvals,

11
00:00:32.939 --> 00:00:35.955
seeking for example
real-time financing.

12
00:00:35.955 --> 00:00:37.560
On a daily basis,

13
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.420
Blend reports that it

14
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.380
processes more than
a billion dollars.

15
00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.310
Now by the way as you
might expect is expanding

16
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.680
its business model to

17
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.060
market services and products
like homeowners insurance.

18
00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.910
Reportedly, Blend received
about a $160 million of

19
00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:57.890
investment funding from

20
00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.600
some well-known
venture capitalists

21
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.700
like Greylock Partners
and Lightspeed,

22
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.795
with a site evaluation
of $500 million.

23
00:01:05.795 --> 00:01:08.810
Lending Home is
a lending platform,

24
00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.015
what we call
Robo-lending offering

25
00:01:11.015 --> 00:01:14.090
intermediate term loans
for active participants,

26
00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.655
some would call
those house flippers.

27
00:01:16.655 --> 00:01:18.560
Those are essentially
underwritten

28
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.170
by accredited investors
or essentially

29
00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.770
millionaire level providers of

30
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.380
capital through the platform,

31
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.150
as well as
institutional investors

32
00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.345
and one might wonder
hedge funds and so on.

33
00:01:32.345 --> 00:01:35.120
Lending home has
funded more than $3.5

34
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.180
billion in loans according
to what it's reported,

35
00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.850
having received
almost a $170 million in

36
00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.660
VC funding from the well-known
Foundation Capital,

37
00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:45.950
which I believe also funded

38
00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.170
many other successful companies

39
00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.235
including Netflix
and Ribbit Capital,

40
00:01:51.235 --> 00:01:54.100
the valuation being
around a billion dollars.

41
00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.965
Open Door is a company relying
on big data technologies,

42
00:01:58.965 --> 00:02:02.040
artificial intelligence
algorithms to

43
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.515
value homes and to buy them
in almost two dozen cities,

44
00:02:07.515 --> 00:02:08.935
charging the seller and

45
00:02:08.935 --> 00:02:11.420
fixing up and
reselling those homes.

46
00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.230
One of the long-term
service providers

47
00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.890
and stalwart in the
realistic technology areas,

48
00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.645
Zillow, has also
entered the business.

49
00:02:20.645 --> 00:02:23.660
About a billion dollars in
funding with about 400 million

50
00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.995
from SoftBank at
evaluation of $1 billion.

51
00:02:26.995 --> 00:02:30.020
Substantial players
in different parts of

52
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.900
the value chain providing
different kinds of services,

53
00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.780
either adding substantial value

54
00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.840
or disrupting
an ancient industry.
