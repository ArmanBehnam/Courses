00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:07.245
So while some pundits
continues suggests that

2
00:00:07.245 --> 00:00:11.205
CRE tech and
real estate technology

3
00:00:11.205 --> 00:00:13.500
generally has not yet

4
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.560
been fully disruptive and
has a long way to go,

5
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.345
I think we can clearly see that

6
00:00:18.345 --> 00:00:23.295
new models platforms and
a democratization is afoot.

7
00:00:23.295 --> 00:00:27.150
The economic implications of
all of this are vast again

8
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.410
because the real estate
industry globally is so large.

9
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.560
Innovation financed by
venture capitalists

10
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.960
are a key part of it,

11
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.760
startup in innovation and

12
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.225
entrepreneurial activities
are and have been critical.

13
00:00:42.225 --> 00:00:46.100
However, there are
large entrance including

14
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.390
CBRE that are coming
into the space.

15
00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.885
We talked also for example,
About Cushman Wakefield.

16
00:00:53.885 --> 00:00:57.440
Some of the basic
technological innovation

17
00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.515
that we might see in
other parts of life IoT,

18
00:01:01.515 --> 00:01:04.230
Smart houses, Smart properties,

19
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.014
are going to increase

20
00:01:06.014 --> 00:01:10.315
the advent and
the availability of data,

21
00:01:10.315 --> 00:01:12.005
and that's going to lead to

22
00:01:12.005 --> 00:01:15.710
ongoing technological disruption.

23
00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.980
It's going to become, we think
of a fairly large sector

24
00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.980
again because of
the scale at stake.

25
00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.390
Just a few years ago,

26
00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.130
let's call it less than ten,

27
00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:26.585
it was a tiny sector.

28
00:01:26.585 --> 00:01:31.760
However, today it's grown
dramatically to the tune of

29
00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:32.885
billions of dollars of

30
00:01:32.885 --> 00:01:37.430
annual funding and expansion
of volumes of business done.

31
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.250
Like the rest of
the fintech industry,

32
00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.490
the primary financial
goals in CRE and

33
00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.710
other kinds of real estate
tech include efficiencies,

34
00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.775
profitability,
increasing margins from

35
00:01:52.775 --> 00:01:56.450
greater aggregation applications

36
00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.205
of low cost technologies,

37
00:01:58.205 --> 00:02:01.910
operational efficiencies,
as well as through

38
00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.630
disintermediation of otherwise
old-school technologies

39
00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.750
and the human element
of real estate.

40
00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.135
Growth has been rapid.

41
00:02:11.135 --> 00:02:14.405
It's hard to estimate
what the future will

42
00:02:14.405 --> 00:02:18.470
portend especially
given economic cycles.

43
00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.300
However, I will say this,

44
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.300
we expect real estate
tech to stay.
