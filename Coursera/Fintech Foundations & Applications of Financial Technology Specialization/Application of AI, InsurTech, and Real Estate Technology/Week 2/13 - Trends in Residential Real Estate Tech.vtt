1
00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:05.805
Some of the same pundits
we've referenced already,

2
00:00:05.805 --> 00:00:09.270
also highlights
significant deltas

3
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.235
in the residential marketplace.

4
00:00:11.235 --> 00:00:13.560
Essentially demographic changes,

5
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.460
emphasis on
certain preferences in

6
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.660
transaction type or outcomes

7
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.325
that are really resulting
in some of the disruptions.

8
00:00:26.325 --> 00:00:29.520
Focusing especially on
the financing side but

9
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.185
not limited to the financing side

10
00:00:31.185 --> 00:00:32.850
of real estate transactions.

11
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.365
Affordability. For example
referencing millennials who

12
00:00:37.365 --> 00:00:40.010
reportedly in the data
spend a greater share

13
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.860
of income on rent than
previous generations,

14
00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.875
reflecting a preference not
to own but in fact to lease.

15
00:00:47.875 --> 00:00:50.780
According to census data,

16
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.060
millennials are more
likely to live at

17
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.480
home than others in previous
generations at the same age.

18
00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.920
The proportion of US citizens
who had married, kids,

19
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.425
and a job and lived on
their own by age 34

20
00:01:06.425 --> 00:01:09.630
collapsed from
about 45 percent in

21
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.965
1975 to 24 percent
recently in 2016.

22
00:01:13.965 --> 00:01:20.895
In addition, where there
are jobs that people like,

23
00:01:20.895 --> 00:01:22.880
home ownership is often out of

24
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.675
the question for those who
are not earning high wages.

25
00:01:26.675 --> 00:01:31.100
For example, one apropos
geographic arena

26
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.660
San Francisco has seen

27
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.050
a median sales price
of almost $1.4

28
00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.200
million focusing
on affordability.

29
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.820
Firms like Divvy,
which is a rent to

30
00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.425
own marketplace and which is

31
00:01:48.425 --> 00:01:54.080
an alternative to
mortgages at a time when

32
00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.740
credit for substantial purchases

33
00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.495
has been rationed
provides alternatives.

34
00:02:01.495 --> 00:02:05.080
Bungelow which
combines a marketplace

35
00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.160
for roommates with property
managers we see disruption.

36
00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.580
Second, some point
to a desire to have

37
00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.240
a community for workplaces
in living places.

38
00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.585
Again, referencing
the millennial generation.

39
00:02:19.585 --> 00:02:25.465
Who represent the first part
of the workforce to operate

40
00:02:25.465 --> 00:02:29.230
entirely with the advent

41
00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.310
of smartphones and in
constant connectivity,

42
00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.470
they've engineered or they've

43
00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.825
been experiencing a focus on

44
00:02:37.825 --> 00:02:43.125
digital community 24 hour

45
00:02:43.125 --> 00:02:47.255
a day at the expense of
traditional community activity.

46
00:02:47.255 --> 00:02:51.700
So it may be internally
important for those people,

47
00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.970
including those who
are younger but

48
00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.430
not limited to those who are
younger to have community.

49
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.695
Tech trends of course should
be expected to follow

50
00:03:03.695 --> 00:03:05.990
that general preference
and of course

51
00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.315
startups are likely to follow.

52
00:03:08.315 --> 00:03:11.000
What Nareche and
Lynn describe "Our

53
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.170
longer work hours making

54
00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.045
community harder to
build organically,

55
00:03:14.045 --> 00:03:16.595
millennials In other words
placing value on

56
00:03:16.595 --> 00:03:19.580
landlords and employers who
facilitate it for them."

57
00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.355
Again, referencing we work.

58
00:03:21.355 --> 00:03:23.475
Then of course flexibility.

59
00:03:23.475 --> 00:03:25.880
With the immediacy inherent in

60
00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.405
the demand economy the "Gig
Economy" enabled about

61
00:03:29.405 --> 00:03:33.620
technology and all kinds of
areas highlighting what has

62
00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.270
become important for

63
00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:37.985
many workers and
consumers flexibility,

64
00:03:37.985 --> 00:03:41.025
furniture rentals, outsourcing of

65
00:03:41.025 --> 00:03:47.000
temporary transient
workplace technologies

66
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.700
and workplace
physical structures.

67
00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.330
It's often treated like
a tech business Feather,

68
00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:54.920
Fernish and CasaOne are

69
00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.965
online shopping and offline
delivery companies.

70
00:03:58.965 --> 00:04:01.310
The company Knack
has a model that I

71
00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.500
find personally
very interesting of

72
00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.750
buying a new home
for a customer for

73
00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.900
cash before the customer lists
their old home actually.

74
00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.720
That company helps
with renovations and

75
00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.065
financing still within
the six percent commission rule.

76
00:04:15.065 --> 00:04:16.775
But now again split

77
00:04:16.775 --> 00:04:19.470
traditionally between
buyer and seller.
