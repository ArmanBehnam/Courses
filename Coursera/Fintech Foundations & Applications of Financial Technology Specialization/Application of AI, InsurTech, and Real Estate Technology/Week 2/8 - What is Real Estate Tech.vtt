00:00:03.342 --> 00:00:05.800
Now what is real estate tech?

2
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.550
How do we define it?

3
00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.500
Well, just like in other spaces
of Fintech, but broadly,

4
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:18.110
there are all kinds of categories,
acronyms, names that come to bear.

5
00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:23.040
We're calling it real estate tech, but
you could call it a RealTech, Prop Tech,

6
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.150
Proptology, RETech, CRE Tech,
which is commercial real estate tech.

7
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.630
And in part it's challenging
to put a specific

8
00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:39.310
overarching name on it because the
segmentation of real estate technology and

9
00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:45.890
how it's being manifested in startups,
or companies adopting technology

10
00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.240
is bifurcated, either on the commercial
side or the non commercial side,

11
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.448
the commercial sector CRE or
residential sectors of the industry.

12
00:00:54.448 --> 00:00:57.520
We're just going to call it real
estate tech broadly even though

13
00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.180
there are very different players and
very different characteristics.

14
00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.280
And we know of relatively few companies
that currently span both spaces.

15
00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.820
So one way to think about
the industry given this challenge

16
00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.860
is to rotate the definitions a bit and

17
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.430
focus either on being additive,
focusing on operational efficiency,

18
00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.660
or on disruption,
by way of creating say new platforms.

19
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.460
And in fact,
maybe some examples could help illustrate.

20
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.314
One company that's been around for
quite sometime, and which many follow,

21
00:01:33.314 --> 00:01:35.510
is a firm called Zillow.

22
00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.270
It's not necessarily today, thought
of as a providing in revolution and

23
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.110
technology although I'm sure there
are those who would disagree.

24
00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.450
And that's in part because
online platforms, portals,

25
00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.980
aggregators for listing residential
properties or multifamily or

26
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:58.530
land as Zillow lists had been
on the scene since the 1990s,

27
00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.760
and were developed in the late 1990s,
mid and late 1990s dot-com boom.

28
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.300
Zillow has combined a bunch
of different functions and

29
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.130
ultimately connected back to brokers,
expanding data access,

30
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.000
democratizing data access for
those who are buying or selling,

31
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.270
as well as connecting to brokers
to become a market leader.

32
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:28.352
Zillow, someone said the other day and
their Zillow's compatriots,

33
00:02:28.352 --> 00:02:34.790
Realtor.com, Redfin and of course, others
that I'm leaving out, but which are also

34
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.990
leaders are useful to to understand
what your own properties are doing.

35
00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.622
Or as they said their spouses spending
their time looking at their neighbors'

36
00:02:43.622 --> 00:02:48.625
properties, giving a kind of
democratized view into regions,

37
00:02:48.625 --> 00:02:53.750
into individual properties,
into being able to search and

38
00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.230
ultimately aggregate
functionalities in a one-stop shop.

39
00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.445
Another one on another side of
the business is a little bit more,

40
00:03:03.445 --> 00:03:05.861
let's say transformative,

41
00:03:05.861 --> 00:03:10.510
by way of introducing a brand
new methodology, WeWork.

42
00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.810
And we'll talk more about
WeWork in a second.

43
00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:19.800
It's often considered to be not
just a provider of real estate,

44
00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.510
transitory real estate or real estate
services but a real estate tech company.

45
00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.240
The concept of shared
workspaces either rented or

46
00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.560
leased, I mean that's been around for
decades and decades.

47
00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.280
And of course, it's a platform technology.

48
00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.340
It's app based.

49
00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.880
So it's not like it's
necessarily bringing brand new

50
00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.240
deep learning technology to the game.

51
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:49.390
It's a transformation of
office space via the progress

52
00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:54.890
of technology and also linking back into
social values and workplace methods.

53
00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:00.860
We think WeWork, has been a category
leader on the commercial side as a result.

54
00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.746
And of course,
we all know it now as a unicorn startup.
