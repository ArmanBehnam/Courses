00:00:03.785 --> 00:00:07.005
It's useful to look at examples, in part,

2
00:00:07.005 --> 00:00:10.320
because of the way
the industry has evolved.

3
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.622
First with operational
efficiency companies, and

4
00:00:14.622 --> 00:00:19.910
then secondly, especially more recently,
with disruptors.

5
00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.164
We start it by looking at Zillow and
WeWork.

6
00:00:23.164 --> 00:00:26.235
We could also have looked at Trulia,

7
00:00:26.235 --> 00:00:31.580
or Loopnet, or others, or
WeWork and its competitors.

8
00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.520
Let's take a look at a couple of those,

9
00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.030
first, focusing on the residential
real estate sector.

10
00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:42.340
The residential sector has
long maintained a pricing

11
00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.160
system and data availability industrially.

12
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:54.320
The MLS services or Multiple Listing
Services has been in place for decades and

13
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.570
has been run by local affiliates of NAR,
the National Association of Realtors.

14
00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.200
It's a trade organization without
access to so-called MLS data.

15
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.610
Historically, it's been a challenge

16
00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.540
to do important exercises
like creating comparables.

17
00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.860
Or, ultimately, shopping for purchases, or

18
00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.220
understanding what market trends are, for
those who are selling their properties.

19
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.860
Realtors, historically, have had what is,
in essence, special access.

20
00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.540
Which has been addressed by some of
the players we've mentioned already.

21
00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:37.460
Today, the Multiple Listing Services is
still owned at least in part by the NAR,

22
00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.140
but there has been pressure.

23
00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.700
And, of course, the advent of business
models like we've mentioned Zillow,

24
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.460
and Trulia, and Loopnet and Redfin.

25
00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.670
Such that the MLS data has been made
available, it's been democratized.

26
00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:57.710
The aggregators have had access to
now bring their business models

27
00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.700
out to both consumers and
those intermediaries who serve them,

28
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.020
in accessing, selling,
and buying real estate.

29
00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.520
Where we might have expected disruption
to see its greatest influence.

30
00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.810
Say, in the historical commission
structure in real estate,

31
00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.340
both residential and commercial,
in some areas known as the 6% rule.

32
00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.144
There's a 6% commission on some real
estate, split by buyer and seller brokers,

33
00:02:23.144 --> 00:02:25.594
that's been fairly resistant to change.

34
00:02:25.594 --> 00:02:27.653
That having been said, again,

35
00:02:27.653 --> 00:02:32.410
coming back to the model of operational
efficiency and/or disruption.

36
00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.690
Technology is now making it
easier to disintermediate

37
00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.140
those spread takers, or
those who would compete on price.

38
00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.595
It's been possible, although it's been
very challenging without a broker,

39
00:02:45.595 --> 00:02:47.931
to be involved in the real estate market.

40
00:02:47.931 --> 00:02:52.450
And many, many people do that every
year without paying a commission.

41
00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.420
But it's been a challenge, in part,
because of the barrier to entry in areas

42
00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.910
like pricing, and
knowing what's going on in a given market.

43
00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.410
In part, that's because residential
real estate transactions

44
00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.520
require a host of Agilent activities.

45
00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.931
Including inspections, title services,

46
00:03:12.931 --> 00:03:16.860
evaluations, appraisals and so on.

47
00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:22.456
And that's been generally challenging
without those intermediaries.
