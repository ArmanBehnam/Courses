00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:05.460
Some market participants have

2
00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.910
really underscored
this difference,

3
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.115
this distinction between adding

4
00:00:11.115 --> 00:00:14.535
operational efficiency or,

5
00:00:14.535 --> 00:00:16.200
to some degree, democratizing of

6
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.520
MLS style listings or disruption.

7
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.660
Some say that what has led
to the situation today,

8
00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.070
the legacy pathway of

9
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.070
real estate technology
only recently has led to

10
00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.190
disruption instead of
emphasizing what I would call it

11
00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.935
incremental efficiency or
operational improvements.

12
00:00:37.935 --> 00:00:40.760
Recently, two venture
capitalist from

13
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.130
the firm Trinity
Ventures wrote the

14
00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.340
following on a blog and I
thought it was well-phrased,

15
00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.250
"Technology has upended
every major industry

16
00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.105
with one exception: real estate.

17
00:00:52.105 --> 00:00:53.760
Instead of completely disrupting

18
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.695
the sector," my emphasis
added there.

19
00:00:55.695 --> 00:00:58.550
"The last generation of
this technology primarily

20
00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.715
improved existing processes
and platforms."

21
00:01:02.715 --> 00:01:04.310
Certain industry leaders

22
00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:05.480
like the ones that
we've discussed,

23
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.850
for example Zillow,
Trulia and LoopNet,

24
00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.355
Redfin, Realtor.com, and others,

25
00:01:10.355 --> 00:01:11.960
help us search for homes,

26
00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.895
commercial real estate,
better, faster,

27
00:01:15.895 --> 00:01:18.260
with greater reach and

28
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.510
efficiency but it
doesn't necessarily

29
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.765
change the underlying
economic characteristic

30
00:01:23.765 --> 00:01:25.915
that the industry is based on.

31
00:01:25.915 --> 00:01:28.545
What are we buying?
What do we leasing?

32
00:01:28.545 --> 00:01:30.030
Whom are we doing it from?

33
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.480
Those of traditional players,

34
00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.030
through brokers or buying
the same real estate,

35
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.445
we're selling the same
real estate and so on.

36
00:01:37.445 --> 00:01:38.540
The next generation.

37
00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.475
However, the proffer,

38
00:01:40.475 --> 00:01:42.950
is more likely to take
an expansive approach,

39
00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.840
dismantling systems,

40
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.295
reimagine what it means
to live and to work.

41
00:01:49.295 --> 00:01:53.255
You could even suggest
that firms like Airbnb

42
00:01:53.255 --> 00:01:55.145
are really real
estate technologies

43
00:01:55.145 --> 00:01:57.395
and I wouldn't necessarily
disagree with that.

44
00:01:57.395 --> 00:01:59.765
They would thus say,
I would presume that

45
00:01:59.765 --> 00:02:03.560
the disruptive state is
now upon us and we'll see

46
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.600
much more of that in the

47
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.120
present and going
forward where there

48
00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:13.050
are fundamental shifts in
how we conduct ourselves,

49
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.620
where, and how we live in
where and how we work.
