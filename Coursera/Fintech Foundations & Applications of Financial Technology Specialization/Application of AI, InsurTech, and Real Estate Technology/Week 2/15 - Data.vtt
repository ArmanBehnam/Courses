1
00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:05.940
Although the advent of

2
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.000
both value-added and
disruptive technology in

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.290
the residential space involves
both the aggregation,

4
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.095
disaggregation,
democratization of data.

5
00:00:16.095 --> 00:00:18.530
Certainly, more than residential,

6
00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:20.235
the commercial sector has been

7
00:00:20.235 --> 00:00:22.740
historically and
today data-driven.

8
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.360
For example, managing

9
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.655
commercial properties
is often extremely

10
00:00:26.655 --> 00:00:29.220
complex and that ranges

11
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.740
from sourcing deals to
doing due diligence,

12
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.500
to managing property really

13
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.610
requiring copious
amounts of data and

14
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.300
transaction details that are

15
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.700
challenging to maintain and

16
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.745
to make useful in the aggregate.

17
00:00:46.745 --> 00:00:51.814
It's no surprise then that
a number of CRE Tech startups

18
00:00:51.814 --> 00:00:58.970
are focusing on this space
and increasing efficiency,

19
00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.920
optimizing, and so on,

20
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.720
those from other industries.

21
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.120
For example, management
information systems in

22
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.445
the form of firms like Workframe.

23
00:01:07.445 --> 00:01:09.545
Protocols are portals
or platforms for

24
00:01:09.545 --> 00:01:12.740
commercial tenants to gain
information and to access

25
00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.100
contracts and to
provide data and share

26
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.955
data back and forth with
commercial real estate managers.

27
00:01:19.955 --> 00:01:23.060
Transaction data aggregate
are all examples of what's

28
00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.250
going on in the commercial
real estate space.

29
00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.465
Here's an example.

30
00:01:26.465 --> 00:01:30.725
WeSmartPark, that is
an Airbnb style firm

31
00:01:30.725 --> 00:01:33.775
for garage parking spaces.

32
00:01:33.775 --> 00:01:40.190
Again, aggregating
data, redirecting data,

33
00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.920
providing for those
who are purchasing.

34
00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.525
Here's another one, Bowery.

35
00:01:44.525 --> 00:01:46.700
This is automating
appraisal processes in

36
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.540
the commercial real estate space
that has been very,

37
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.380
let's say, old industry,

38
00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.525
the paper-based for many years.

39
00:01:56.525 --> 00:02:00.380
Cushman & Wakefield,
the large commercial broker

40
00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.360
is partnered with Bowery and

41
00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.760
the firm although it's
only four years old,

42
00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.530
has recently raised
$12 million in

43
00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.370
a Series A from a number of
top venture capitalists.
