00:00:02.914 --> 00:00:05.684
Now let's talk about the commercial
side of the industry.

2
00:00:05.684 --> 00:00:10.254
It's a segment that is dramatic in size.

3
00:00:10.254 --> 00:00:13.876
Real Estate Tech for
the sector otherwise known as CRE Tech,

4
00:00:13.876 --> 00:00:17.934
Commercial Real Estate Tech,
also saw a substantial investment.

5
00:00:17.934 --> 00:00:22.931
Last year almost $10 billion of
investment flowed into CRE Tech.

6
00:00:22.931 --> 00:00:27.003
That's a drop from the 2017 level,
however,

7
00:00:27.003 --> 00:00:32.023
that was an outlier,
some might say in 2017 resulting from

8
00:00:32.023 --> 00:00:36.679
soft banks multi-billion
dollar investment in WeWork.

9
00:00:36.679 --> 00:00:43.300
CRE Tech also goes beyond apps,
algos, and websites.

10
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:49.798
It includes all kinds of value added
technologically related tools like IoT,

11
00:00:49.798 --> 00:00:54.623
Internet of Things,
inherent in the commercial space and

12
00:00:54.623 --> 00:00:58.082
of course also in the residential space.

13
00:00:58.082 --> 00:01:03.689
Nest Tag, for example,
offers key fobs to control home functions,

14
00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:06.983
smart thermostats, home automation.

15
00:01:06.983 --> 00:01:11.812
Photovoltaic glass to save on
energy while also generating it.

16
00:01:11.812 --> 00:01:14.874
Putting solar cells inside glass and

17
00:01:14.874 --> 00:01:20.306
then tech enabling construction,
maintenance, monitoring,

18
00:01:20.306 --> 00:01:25.442
aggregating information not just for
a given office space but

19
00:01:25.442 --> 00:01:30.900
across buildings or multiple buildings,
residences and so on.

20
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.840
The increase in institutional capital
flowing into the space has both

21
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.781
motivated and provided for
this kind of innovative technology R&D,

22
00:01:40.781 --> 00:01:44.314
historically, and
we see it in today's values.

23
00:01:44.314 --> 00:01:50.624
For example, between 2009 and
2017, that's just eight years,

24
00:01:50.624 --> 00:01:57.735
we saw a doubling of institutional capital
committed to CRE Tech, 400 billion,

25
00:01:57.735 --> 00:02:04.070
now stands at about 800 billion when
we think of CRE Tech as being broad.
