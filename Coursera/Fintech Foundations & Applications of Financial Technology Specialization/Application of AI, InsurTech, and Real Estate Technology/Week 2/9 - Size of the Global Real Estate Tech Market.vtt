1
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.623
So what can we say today
about the level or

2
00:00:05.623 --> 00:00:09.730
change in the size of the global
real estate tech market?

3
00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.870
Again, depends upon your perspective and
where we look

4
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.840
in the value chain of real estate or
within a given category versus another.

5
00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.010
We can look at tech companies funded,

6
00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.640
we could look at the amount of
the funding, we would look at examples.

7
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.339
What we found was that a couple or a few
dozen, depending upon the statistics,

8
00:00:33.339 --> 00:00:37.818
companies were funded in
the last part of 2018.

9
00:00:37.818 --> 00:00:42.964
Take November and December,
each saw something like two dozen

10
00:00:42.964 --> 00:00:48.694
real estate tech companies having
been funded to the tune of somewhere

11
00:00:48.694 --> 00:00:53.670
between 3 billion and
108 million for funding levels.

12
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.560
The largest amount raised globally
was $30 million by NeueHouse.

13
00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:04.857
Juniper Square and Zesty.ai with
median funding being much smaller,

14
00:01:04.857 --> 00:01:09.112
around 3.2 million and
December 1.4 in November.

15
00:01:09.112 --> 00:01:11.653
NeueHouse, the company
that received a reported

16
00:01:11.653 --> 00:01:15.070
$30 million in funding
is located in New York.

17
00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:20.680
Whereas Juniper square is located in
San Francisco, receiving 25 million.

18
00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.264
And again, Zesty.ai from Oakland,
California at 13 million.

19
00:01:25.264 --> 00:01:31.969
WhyHotel, again a US-based company,
just eclipsed Dazhu from Pingxiang,

20
00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:36.760
Hebei, China, which was at 7.3 million.

21
00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:42.030
Facilio, Home Hero, BuildSupply,
Residently, and Wealth Migrate,

22
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.700
in order of decreasing amounts received
6.4 million down to 1.5 million.

23
00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.680
This pattern of funding is part and
parcel of an ongoing trend.

24
00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:01.430
And if we look at the industry
tracking organizations cbinsights.com,

25
00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.555
you'll see that what
was aggregated in 2012

26
00:02:06.555 --> 00:02:11.680
at approximately 72 deals or $221 million

27
00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:18.055
was along a path of increase
in 2013 about 112 deals,

28
00:02:18.055 --> 00:02:22.055
$460 million through 2016,

29
00:02:22.055 --> 00:02:26.187
235 deals worth $2.7 billion.

30
00:02:26.187 --> 00:02:31.735
So if you patch the data together,
you can see ongoing spread,

31
00:02:31.735 --> 00:02:37.076
ongoing investment,
ongoing preponderance of real estate

32
00:02:37.076 --> 00:02:42.959
tech companies by funding and
other measures including numbers.
