00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.220
Hi, welcome back now to

2
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.040
our next lecture in our
FinTech module called

3
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.920
real estate Tech or real Tech
in some in some parlance.

4
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.510
Real estate is an incredibly

5
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:17.280
interesting area
in part because of

6
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.495
the size of the space
by almost any measure.

7
00:00:21.495 --> 00:00:24.375
Real estate which is
sometimes classified as

8
00:00:24.375 --> 00:00:27.765
a so-called alternative
investment is vast,

9
00:00:27.765 --> 00:00:29.730
as an asset class,

10
00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.129
as an area of interest,

11
00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:33.450
and certainly as an area of

12
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.430
identified interest
with respect to

13
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.740
FinTech digital methods
and technologies.

14
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:46.535
Also interest by those who
overlap in both areas.

15
00:00:46.535 --> 00:00:48.830
It's called alternative although,

16
00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:50.630
depending upon
your phenomenology or

17
00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.550
your metaphysics you might

18
00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.490
presume that real estate
proceeded humanity.

19
00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.710
There in other words was probably

20
00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.095
real estate before humans.

21
00:01:00.095 --> 00:01:03.575
Real estate around
the globe is a large area.

22
00:01:03.575 --> 00:01:05.719
Getting a handle on exactly

23
00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:08.285
how large either with respect to

24
00:01:08.285 --> 00:01:12.140
market cap or valuation
or returns as

25
00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.075
a challenge in part because
of its vast nature.

26
00:01:16.075 --> 00:01:17.395
How we define it,

27
00:01:17.395 --> 00:01:18.905
how we track it, and so on.

28
00:01:18.905 --> 00:01:21.395
But what's clear is
that it's very large.

29
00:01:21.395 --> 00:01:27.365
To give you a sense
around the globe sales of

30
00:01:27.365 --> 00:01:29.240
commercial properties as of

31
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.600
a most recent mark-to-market
here fiscal year 2017

32
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.205
was almost a trillion
dollars US dollars.

33
00:01:36.205 --> 00:01:38.480
Within the United States

34
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.810
just the commercial section
of what we call real estate

35
00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.510
asset classes in fiscal year
2017 was about $376 billion.

36
00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.300
In the US markets
are large that's

37
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.305
about 57 percent of
the total around the globe.

38
00:01:54.305 --> 00:01:57.470
Another area which
will define a bit in a

39
00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.650
second the residential sector
for real estate so 5.3

40
00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.870
million homes what
are called existing

41
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.750
homes and almost 670
thousand new homes

42
00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.880
being sold in 2018.

43
00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.770
That's a measure of size by

44
00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.635
volume of trades or transactions.

45
00:02:15.635 --> 00:02:17.570
There were about 86,000

46
00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.580
real estate brokerage firms
in the United States.

47
00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.000
Again, from the most recent
economic census data we have

48
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.910
available to us and 2 million
active real estate license,

49
00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.660
that is to say those
who are qualified as

50
00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.690
brokers to sell real estate
in the United States.

51
00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.690
It's big by many
different measures

52
00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.445
from many different perspectives.

53
00:02:37.445 --> 00:02:41.209
In addition, many
professional asset allocators

54
00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:43.640
and investors are expected
real estate to expand

55
00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.255
although there are
some immediate concerns

56
00:02:47.255 --> 00:02:51.695
about what some would call
bubbles in certain areas.

57
00:02:51.695 --> 00:02:56.375
Increasing allocation to
real assets as part of

58
00:02:56.375 --> 00:03:01.570
investment plans has
been democratized,

59
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:02.600
you might have heard of

60
00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.790
the famous endowment
model followed

61
00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.925
by university endowments
and foundations that

62
00:03:07.925 --> 00:03:10.655
allocate to
tangible asset classes

63
00:03:10.655 --> 00:03:11.810
of which real estate is at

64
00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.000
the heart or even individuals

65
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.490
who might purchase
real estate in some sense.

66
00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:18.305
Although, there are
some trends against

67
00:03:18.305 --> 00:03:21.665
some demographics especially
in the US especially

68
00:03:21.665 --> 00:03:24.350
those we might call
millennials as

69
00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.005
we've discussed who have
different preferences

70
00:03:27.005 --> 00:03:32.725
over owning some areas
of real estate.

71
00:03:32.725 --> 00:03:38.500
Appreciation or rate of
return or ROR has been

72
00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.110
ongoing in positive in the US

73
00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.350
and around the world over
recent historical periods.

74
00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.900
On the graph you
see in front of you

75
00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.590
is what we call the
net drift data.

76
00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.260
Moving across multiple what

77
00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.495
we call sectors in real estate.

78
00:03:56.495 --> 00:04:01.170
Apartment, buildings, office
buildings or office spaces,

79
00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.270
industrial properties,
retail properties,

80
00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:06.694
and then hotels roughly

81
00:04:06.694 --> 00:04:09.980
speaking although
variances can occur

82
00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.810
generally thought to
be from lower risk

83
00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.040
on the left to higher is

84
00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.775
less Prosecco on the left and
more Prosecco on the right.

85
00:04:16.775 --> 00:04:18.770
In other words, more attuned

86
00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:21.035
or connected to
the macro economy.

87
00:04:21.035 --> 00:04:24.620
Then within those
sub-sectors suburban

88
00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:29.350
office space versus central
business district or CBD,

89
00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.785
malls versus retail centers

90
00:04:32.785 --> 00:04:37.640
or apartments and hotels
treated separately.

91
00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:41.090
What you see is over

92
00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.470
longer-term data available
historical time periods.

93
00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.850
Real estate overall has
produced returns that are of

94
00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.570
the same order of magnitude
say of US or global equities.

95
00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:56.905
You can see apartments have
including all returns that

96
00:04:56.905 --> 00:04:58.630
is coming from cash flow plus

97
00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.900
price appreciation has
been around 10 percent.

98
00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.230
In the last five years, is
little bit less around 8.6

99
00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:06.850
percent and over
the most recent year

100
00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:12.385
available 2017 to 2018
about 6.3 percent.

101
00:05:12.385 --> 00:05:14.695
There is variation
across classes,

102
00:05:14.695 --> 00:05:17.020
industrial properties
have appreciated on

103
00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.300
average more and we might say

104
00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.775
that suburban offerings
office space

105
00:05:21.775 --> 00:05:24.430
in the aggregate as
appreciated less.

106
00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.900
But one thing is clear,
it's been positive.

107
00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:32.890
It has been positive
across diverse kinds of

108
00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:37.750
real estate and it's been
an area of organic growth.

109
00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:41.785
It's not to say though
that's resulted in

110
00:05:41.785 --> 00:05:46.960
forward-looking valuations
that are at historical peaks.

111
00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:52.795
In fact one way one statistic
useful for measuring by

112
00:05:52.795 --> 00:05:54.970
either expected real
estate returns or

113
00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:56.860
current what are called

114
00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.605
yields on real estates
are to look at cap rates.

115
00:05:59.605 --> 00:06:02.080
Cap rate stands for
capitalization rate,

116
00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.680
and it's essentially the rate
of cash flows coming

117
00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.500
from a property scaled

118
00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.720
by the value of the price
of the property,

119
00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.370
it's often compared to
a dividend yield in

120
00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:16.010
stocks or yield on bonds.

121
00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:18.560
Here you can see
a rate spread compared to

122
00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.230
the 10 year government
bond yield as

123
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:26.675
of the third quarter of 2018
and the end of 2017.

124
00:06:26.675 --> 00:06:28.820
It's a comparable spread in

125
00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.175
part because real estate is often

126
00:06:31.175 --> 00:06:33.080
held over longer
holding periods than

127
00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.275
say a typical stop
can or might be held.

128
00:06:36.275 --> 00:06:39.065
Although certainly people
hold stocks for a long time,

129
00:06:39.065 --> 00:06:41.030
and it serves as a benchmark

130
00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:44.060
spread real estate has and is

131
00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:46.010
expected to earn based on

132
00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:49.190
current cap rates more than
US government bonds.

133
00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:51.605
But those spreads have actually

134
00:06:51.605 --> 00:06:54.265
decreased in very recent times.

135
00:06:54.265 --> 00:06:56.980
Still, in part because of risk,

136
00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:59.300
in part because afford
living expectations,

137
00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:02.550
they tended to have yields or

138
00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:07.220
cash flow percentages
above US treasuries.

139
00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:09.260
As you can see there's diversity

140
00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.780
both across type of property

141
00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:17.700
and geographic location in
the yield spreads for example.

142
00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:19.640
Although, they're of
the same order of

143
00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:23.690
magnitude office space in
Asia and or Asia Pacific in

144
00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:27.140
the aggregate has earned
or is expected to

145
00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:31.070
earn on the basis of
capitalization rates,

146
00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:33.365
greater yield than
office space in Europe.

147
00:07:33.365 --> 00:07:34.850
So again across office

148
00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:38.780
retail and other spaces and
Asia US in Europe we do

149
00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:45.240
see some historical and
current differences in yields.
