00:00:04.298 --> 00:00:09.222
A couple other examples would be useful
to understand some of the segmentation

2
00:00:09.222 --> 00:00:11.800
that we've been discussing.

3
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.190
Take, for example, Cadre.

4
00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.950
Cadre allows for the buying and
selling of multifamily real

5
00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.970
estate apartment buildings, for example,
as well as commercial real estate.

6
00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.105
The idea here, once again,
is sourcing deals for

7
00:00:27.105 --> 00:00:29.540
accredited investors and institutions.

8
00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.350
Again, accredited investors
are generally defined in

9
00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.540
the US as those that have a million
dollars in invested capital.

10
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.221
Historically, it's also referred
to those who have, let's say,

11
00:00:39.221 --> 00:00:43.729
individually, $200,000 of income over
the recent multi-year period and

12
00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:46.645
the expectation of having
that going forward.

13
00:00:46.645 --> 00:00:49.970
Accredited investors are interesting
because under the Jobs Act,

14
00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:57.170
Jumpstart Our Businesses Act,
that arose from the Dodd-Frank

15
00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.170
set of regulation changes post-financial
crisis in the US have highlighted

16
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:10.080
accredited investors as being those
who can transact on platforms.

17
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.167
Here, Cadre is reporting to try
to lower fees, lockups, and so

18
00:01:15.167 --> 00:01:21.680
on, for investors, providing greater
liquidity than private equity.

19
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.130
Interestingly enough, Jared Kushner
is one of the founders of Cadre.

20
00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:33.490
Top Line Venture Capitalists put up
around $133 million at an $800 million

21
00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:39.760
valuation cited early in 2019, including
Thrive Capital and Andreessen Horowitz.

22
00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.670
Another startup, Fundrise,
which received just under $60 million of

23
00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.300
funding from Renren, Guggenheim Partners,
and other investors,

24
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.960
institutional investors,
presented a crowdsourcing platform for

25
00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.230
portfolios of different
kinds of real estate.

26
00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.500
Not limited only in this case to
accredited investors with a minimum

27
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.310
investments of $500.

28
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.360
A democratization of
real-estate investing for

29
00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.820
those who have small amounts of capital.

30
00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:14.344
Aggregating at around $2.5
billion worth of invested real

31
00:02:14.344 --> 00:02:18.538
estate with a recent
evaluation about $800 million.

32
00:02:18.538 --> 00:02:24.682
Part of a disruptive, let's call it,
again, a democratization of what has been

33
00:02:24.682 --> 00:02:31.880
historically a much more private investor
orientation in commercial investment.

34
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.890
Another one is Cherre,
which is along the AI vector in FinTech,

35
00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.180
data aggregation, but also
an analytical data visualization firm.

36
00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.780
That puts together and
provides analysis on thousands and

37
00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:52.010
thousands of public private and
internal data sources for clients.

38
00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.520
They received a small round recently,
about $9 million, 15 investors, including

39
00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.240
hedge funds, venture capitalists,
and so on at an unknown valuation.

40
00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.498
Again, applying the latest, reportedly,
artificial intelligence technologies to

41
00:03:05.498 --> 00:03:10.540
data in the commercial space, which is so
critical for those actors who are buying,

42
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.179
selling, leasing, or
brokering commercial real estate.
