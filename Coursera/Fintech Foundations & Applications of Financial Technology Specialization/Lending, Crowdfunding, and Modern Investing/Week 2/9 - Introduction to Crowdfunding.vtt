00:00:03.984 --> 00:00:06.605
Hi, well, this course covers crowdfunding,

2
00:00:06.605 --> 00:00:10.580
which is a very new arrival
to America's capital markets.

3
00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:15.910
Crowdfunding started in
earnest in spring of 2016,

4
00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.170
which is just three years ago,
from where I'm speaking.

5
00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.320
And three years would be a short track
record for anything, any sort of

6
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.340
financial market or security, but for
start-ups it's a very short track record.

7
00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.100
I mean, think of anybody you know,
someone you knew in school,

8
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.860
someone in your neighborhood
who quit the day job,

9
00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.660
started a new company, and
started working towards success.

10
00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.126
How long did it take for
that person to achieve, for

11
00:00:47.126 --> 00:00:52.124
their project to achieve some level of
promise that would show the value of

12
00:00:52.124 --> 00:00:56.900
what they were investing in,
then probably not three years, right?

13
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.065
Four, five, it could be ten years, right?

14
00:00:59.065 --> 00:01:05.203
So, for crowdfunding, crowdfunding,
as I say, we've just started crowdfunding.

15
00:01:05.203 --> 00:01:10.757
Three years ago is when the first
companies got their money this way.

16
00:01:10.757 --> 00:01:15.713
And so, this is a market that's so
new that this course isn't going to be

17
00:01:15.713 --> 00:01:21.089
thinking so much about, well,
what has crowdfunding done for us, right?

18
00:01:21.089 --> 00:01:25.883
It's too early to say what
crowdfunding has done for us, but

19
00:01:25.883 --> 00:01:30.771
we can do is look at what crowdfunding
is and see how it might fit

20
00:01:30.771 --> 00:01:36.320
in to the whole sort of ecosystem
of financing innovation.

21
00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.903
Okay, so the focus of this module is
not so much on the realized experience

22
00:01:41.903 --> 00:01:46.857
of crowdfunding, it's about
the promises and also we'll think

23
00:01:46.857 --> 00:01:52.320
a lot about the conceptual challenges
of crowdfunding, all right?

24
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.211
So it's not only very possible
if you're an investor

25
00:01:56.211 --> 00:02:00.016
in crowdfunding to lose
everything you invested and

26
00:02:00.016 --> 00:02:04.259
to just generally have
a negative experience, right,?

27
00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.060
That's certainly possible.

28
00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.772
It's also possible, as far as we know,
that looking back on these early years,

29
00:02:11.772 --> 00:02:16.394
the general experience of investors
might be negative, right?

30
00:02:16.394 --> 00:02:18.168
We just don't know yet.

31
00:02:18.168 --> 00:02:24.356
And over time, given sort of the feedback
loop of companies going to this market,

32
00:02:24.356 --> 00:02:30.004
investors trying it out, having
an experience and so on, over the years,

33
00:02:30.004 --> 00:02:34.663
which could be a lot of years
given the life cycle of a company,

34
00:02:34.663 --> 00:02:38.910
crowdfunding is going to find
its place in the economy.

35
00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:45.041
Okay, so, coming out of this course
you will have a framework for

36
00:02:45.041 --> 00:02:50.284
thinking of the challenges
that crowdfunding faces and

37
00:02:50.284 --> 00:02:54.745
how you can potentially
overcome them either as

38
00:02:54.745 --> 00:02:58.559
an entrepreneur or an investor, okay?

39
00:02:58.559 --> 00:03:04.860
So we're going to have five sections
of this module after this introduction.

40
00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.149
First, I'm going to briefly
review how companies

41
00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:16.668
have traditionally connected
with retail investors, okay?

42
00:03:16.668 --> 00:03:21.863
The whole process of tapping the retail
markets has evolved over the years

43
00:03:21.863 --> 00:03:26.970
to a very kind of set procedure at this
point, and I want to think about what

44
00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:32.189
that is and maybe we can think about
why it has evolved to what it is, okay?

45
00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:33.770
So that will be the first module.

46
00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:39.526
The second one will look
at the act of congress

47
00:03:39.526 --> 00:03:45.739
signed into law by
President Obama in 2012,

48
00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:51.344
the JOBS Act,
that gave us crowdfunding and

49
00:03:51.344 --> 00:03:57.254
also gave us similar
related vehicles also for

50
00:03:57.254 --> 00:04:03.190
companies to tap the markets
in some new ways.

51
00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:04.806
So we'll talk about that,

52
00:04:04.806 --> 00:04:09.177
that'll be the second module focused
on the JOBS Act of 2012, okay?

53
00:04:09.177 --> 00:04:13.728
And then the third module
will be thinking about

54
00:04:13.728 --> 00:04:18.060
the costs of funding in this market,
right?

55
00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:23.200
Thinking specifically about the cost
to you as an investor of going

56
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:28.617
to crowdfunding, picking companies
to invest in thinking through,

57
00:04:28.617 --> 00:04:33.663
just given the limits on how much
you can invest and other things,

58
00:04:33.663 --> 00:04:39.261
how realistic is it that you could hope
for a positive expected return and

59
00:04:39.261 --> 00:04:42.702
kind of what are the issues
involved there.

60
00:04:42.702 --> 00:04:47.658
Okay, and then we'll think about,
the next module is

61
00:04:47.658 --> 00:04:53.152
going to really focus on the crowd
piece of this by which I mean,

62
00:04:53.152 --> 00:04:57.811
what can you gain from
the sort of wisdom of crowds?

63
00:04:57.811 --> 00:05:00.659
How much should you expect
that to work for you?

64
00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:05.482
If I'm investing in crowdfunding, well,
there's other people investing too.

65
00:05:05.482 --> 00:05:11.560
We generally think of markets as sort
of aggregating the wisdom of crowds.

66
00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.717
Well, is that something
that's going to be there for

67
00:05:14.717 --> 00:05:19.218
us as an investor in this market,
I mean, what are the issues there, okay?

68
00:05:19.218 --> 00:05:23.933
And then finally,
once we've gone through those,

69
00:05:23.933 --> 00:05:28.861
all those modules,
I think you'll see the importance

70
00:05:28.861 --> 00:05:33.164
of non-financial motives for crowdfunding.

71
00:05:33.164 --> 00:05:38.596
The probably large role
in the typical investors'

72
00:05:38.596 --> 00:05:43.270
mind of motives other
than just the expected

73
00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:48.448
return of the investment
when we are investing in

74
00:05:48.448 --> 00:05:54.040
a crowdfunding startup that
we see on the web page.

75
00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.992
So those are going to be
the modules that we go through.

76
00:05:56.992 --> 00:06:01.251
And so we'll start by just thinking about
how have we been going to the capital

77
00:06:01.251 --> 00:06:02.637
markets over the years.
