1
00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.860
All right. So we owe
crowdfunding to the Jobs Act.

2
00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:14.760
Now, the jobs Act was a
bipartisan legislation

3
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.600
that developed in
2011 and was finally

4
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.300
signed into law by
President Obama in 2012,

5
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.040
it's rather remarkable fact,

6
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.940
is by itself by the way is
bipartisan legislation in

7
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.240
an election year but this was

8
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:37.820
a topic that was much on
the minds of people in Congress,

9
00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.270
here we were coming out of
the Great Recession right.

10
00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.320
The darkest moments I
suppose were 2009 into

11
00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:51.430
2010 and the rate of
IPOs was very low,

12
00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.390
it was almost
nonexistent for awhile

13
00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.630
there and you may remember,
you remember those days,

14
00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.955
remember Ben Bernanke
talking about

15
00:00:58.955 --> 00:01:01.940
looking for "green shoots" right,

16
00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.520
like new plants growing up

17
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.865
after there's been a forest fire
or something like that,

18
00:01:07.865 --> 00:01:09.530
signs of new life,

19
00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.560
the next generation of

20
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.100
entrepreneurship rising
out of the ashes.

21
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.240
So that was the context in
which Congress was thinking,

22
00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.870
what can we do?

23
00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:27.660
What can we do to bring
capital into startups?

24
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.490
Get entrepreneurship
going to jumpstart right,

25
00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:32.840
so jobs were the stand for

26
00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.810
jump-start our
business startups act,

27
00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.120
that's how you get
jobs right, okay.

28
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.640
Jump Start Our
Business Startups Act.

29
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:47.460
So that was 2012 and if
you look at the jobs Act,

30
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.940
there were four titles,

31
00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.500
it's really title three that
we really care about here,

32
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.690
when people talk
about crowdfunding,

33
00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.040
they're talking about title

34
00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.230
three which people often

35
00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.450
just called Regulation
crowdfunding,

36
00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.630
okay, but there's
three other titles too,

37
00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.850
so let me just sketch what's

38
00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.610
going on with all the
titles and then from

39
00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.920
then onwards in this module we'll

40
00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.040
focus largely on
title three, okay.

41
00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.040
So these different titles
as you'll see are focusing

42
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.950
on somewhat different points on

43
00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.160
the startup growth curve

44
00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.720
and they are trying to

45
00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.230
bring different benefits
to different companies,

46
00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.500
address the concerns
that would be most

47
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.415
on your mind at
those different points,

48
00:02:36.415 --> 00:02:38.100
okay, and also these titles

49
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.590
also took effect at
different times.

50
00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.240
I said title three took
effect in mid-2016,

51
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.730
the other titles actually

52
00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.545
kicked in a little
earlier than that.

53
00:02:48.545 --> 00:02:50.520
Okay so, title one.

54
00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.740
Title one, the phrase people

55
00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:59.120
associate with title one is
emerging growth company,

56
00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.310
emerging growth company
and the idea of title

57
00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.650
one was you've got companies

58
00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.410
that might want to

59
00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.310
go public but maybe
something's holding them back.

60
00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.350
Something's holding
them back from

61
00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.440
going public and can
we identify what's

62
00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:21.030
holding them back and maybe
relax a little bit on

63
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.730
the costs or the restrictions

64
00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.950
that are keeping them from
tapping the capital markets.

65
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.720
Okay. So the idea was
emerging growth companies,

66
00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.680
so the idea that
a company that is

67
00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.490
making less than a billion
dollars in revenue,

68
00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:40.475
not profit, revenue,
a billion dollars.

69
00:03:40.475 --> 00:03:42.800
That such a company
would be called

70
00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.525
an emerging growth company

71
00:03:44.525 --> 00:03:47.180
and if they wanted to go public,

72
00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.440
they could do it in
a less onerous way,

73
00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.690
a way that might be
a little less costly

74
00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.230
or intimidating to them

75
00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.020
than and that's maybe

76
00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.330
that's why they're
not doing it, okay.

77
00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.120
So one of the big pieces

78
00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.760
of it and this has
really caught on,

79
00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:13.845
is confidential review process.

80
00:04:13.845 --> 00:04:16.110
Okay. So the idea is,
so I mentioned that in

81
00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:20.430
the previous section that
if I'm going to go public,

82
00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.240
I submit this draft,

83
00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.860
statement and then
the SEC reads it very

84
00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.960
carefully and then they give

85
00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.090
me all these bullets and I
have to respond to that,

86
00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:30.515
and go back and forth
back and forth.

87
00:04:30.515 --> 00:04:33.830
Well, if I'm an emerging
growth company,

88
00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.375
I might still have to do all that

89
00:04:35.375 --> 00:04:38.870
but it's all confidential, right,

90
00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.240
so the public doesn't
see any of that,

91
00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.340
it doesn't see any of that,

92
00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.390
unless and until I

93
00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:51.100
decide that let's do it,
let's go public right.

94
00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.060
So as long as I could go
through that whole process

95
00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.570
which takes months, all right,

96
00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:59.070
it takes months and then at
the end of that process,

97
00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:00.210
I can decide well,

98
00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:01.620
okay, do I want to
do this or not?

99
00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:02.690
Do I want to go public or not?

100
00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:03.980
I might think well,

101
00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.350
given the feedback I'm

102
00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:09.860
getting from the SEC
or maybe just given

103
00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.170
what's happened elsewhere in

104
00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:13.700
the markets for
several months because

105
00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:17.475
several months is
a long time right,

106
00:05:17.475 --> 00:05:19.620
I'm thinking back to last year,

107
00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.750
I'm like thinking back to 2018.

108
00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:26.760
Well, mid 2018 was gangbusters
in the stock market,

109
00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.280
lots of IPOs, everyone's
going to market.

110
00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.850
Late 2018, you may

111
00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.540
remember the market
just fell off a cliff,

112
00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:37.565
everything stopped, it
was high volatility.

113
00:05:37.565 --> 00:05:38.870
So you could have started

114
00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:43.490
the process mid-2018 thinking
okay, this is great,

115
00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:47.820
let's get going and then
you get to November,

116
00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:49.020
so, wait a second,

117
00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:52.320
you just stomp on
the brakes and not do it,

118
00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.220
and if you did, the public
would never even

119
00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:58.270
know that you
started the process.

120
00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:59.825
It's all confidential right,

121
00:05:59.825 --> 00:06:03.740
and so you don't have
these embarrassment essentially

122
00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:09.130
of starting something
that you then stop,

123
00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:10.625
and also you don't have to

124
00:06:10.625 --> 00:06:13.490
disclose all that
confidential information,

125
00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:16.325
think about Lyft right, well,

126
00:06:16.325 --> 00:06:24.530
when Lyft, when people could
see the Lyft's financials,

127
00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:26.210
they learned quite a lot
of things they

128
00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:28.805
didn't already know, right.

129
00:06:28.805 --> 00:06:32.330
Uber hasn't done that
right, we know about Lyft,

130
00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:33.620
we don't know about Uber now,

131
00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:36.680
right because Lyft
is going public.

132
00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:43.755
So you can decide
not to go public,

133
00:06:43.755 --> 00:06:47.840
you can in some sense fail
privately in this process,

134
00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.640
and of course you can
always just pick it up

135
00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:53.120
and do it some other time, okay.

136
00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.580
So that has really

137
00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:58.930
caught on as a way to go
public and by the way,

138
00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:01.685
so originally this business

139
00:07:01.685 --> 00:07:05.220
of confidential filing was

140
00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:08.190
only for the emerging
growth companies.

141
00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:12.320
That piece of title one
has now been expanded by

142
00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:14.120
the Trump administration to

143
00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:15.830
essentially all companies right.

144
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:19.230
So anybody can now do this,

145
00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:24.395
anyone can do this
confidential first step.

146
00:07:24.395 --> 00:07:27.125
There are also
other pieces to title one,

147
00:07:27.125 --> 00:07:32.390
other cost and frictions

148
00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:34.280
that people complain about

149
00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:36.440
the IPO process, so yeah, well,

150
00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:41.360
it's very cumbersome to

151
00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.555
have audited financials
going way back,

152
00:07:43.555 --> 00:07:44.780
well for title one,

153
00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:47.060
you only need two years
and not three.

154
00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:48.710
You don't have to
disclose as much

155
00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:50.225
about your compensation.

156
00:07:50.225 --> 00:07:52.310
You don't have to do what's

157
00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:54.590
called "say on pay"
for a few years,

158
00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:55.610
"say on pay" you may

159
00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:58.220
know came out of
the Dodd-Frank bill,

160
00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:01.070
"say on pay" is where
a company has to disclose,

161
00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:02.635
here's what we're paying,

162
00:08:02.635 --> 00:08:05.840
here's what we're
paying our top people.

163
00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:08.600
They put it out there and then

164
00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:11.600
the investors can
vote, yes or no,

165
00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:14.905
I should say they vote
yes or no, that's just,

166
00:08:14.905 --> 00:08:16.560
if you vote no, if

167
00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.020
the investors ultimately
vote no they can

168
00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:19.655
still pay that it's embarrassing

169
00:08:19.655 --> 00:08:20.870
but they can still pay it.

170
00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:23.990
So "say on pay" is more of
a poll of their investors,

171
00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:25.490
it's embarrassing
to lose the poll

172
00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:27.380
but it doesn't directly mean you

173
00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:28.700
can't pay them but that's still

174
00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:30.890
a big deal to some companies.

175
00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:32.995
Some companies like
to do "say on pay",

176
00:08:32.995 --> 00:08:35.280
they're perfectly happy
with their compensation

177
00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.670
and they know that
the public will like it,

178
00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:40.860
others of course not so.

179
00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:43.430
Anyhow, so you're exempt
from "say on pay"

180
00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:46.220
for a few years and there's
some other things like that.

181
00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:47.840
One of the big things
people talk about,

182
00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:50.360
this is going to sound tiny
but it ends up being huge,

183
00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:54.670
coming out of WorldCom and Enron,

184
00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:58.250
thinking back to
the Sarbanes-Oxley Bill

185
00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:00.025
that came out of that,

186
00:09:00.025 --> 00:09:02.100
that set of disasters right,

187
00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:05.025
in the early 2001-2002,

188
00:09:05.025 --> 00:09:07.455
coming out of that.

189
00:09:07.455 --> 00:09:10.220
From that point onwards,

190
00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:12.830
companies had to have

191
00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:16.930
an auditor attest to

192
00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:19.550
the strength of
your internal controls

193
00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:21.975
over financial reporting, right.

194
00:09:21.975 --> 00:09:24.500
Now, that might sound very
inside baseball right,

195
00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:27.170
I mean having
an auditor attest to

196
00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:28.940
the quality of
your internal controls

197
00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:31.220
over financial reporting, well,

198
00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:33.080
when you think about
Enron, WorldCom,

199
00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:35.540
I mean just look
back, read those,

200
00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:38.330
you can see well that
was the problem right.

201
00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:41.240
So it's very difficult to

202
00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:43.940
be confident that a company
has good controls.

203
00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:45.940
It's very expensive to
do that and there are

204
00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:49.080
companies that will
say that right there,

205
00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:51.080
the expense of that auditing

206
00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:53.000
of our internal
controls are so high,

207
00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.850
that right there is
enough not to go public.

208
00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:57.710
So companies are exempt

209
00:09:57.710 --> 00:09:59.870
for a bit from that
but eventually,

210
00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:01.445
yes you do have to do that.

211
00:10:01.445 --> 00:10:05.570
You eventually you do have

212
00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:07.520
to show the world that you

213
00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:10.025
have controls over
your financial reporting, okay.

214
00:10:10.025 --> 00:10:11.165
So that's title one,

215
00:10:11.165 --> 00:10:15.860
title one is all about
making it easier to go IPO,

216
00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:18.320
identifying some of the frictions

217
00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:19.670
that keep people back from doing

218
00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:21.785
that and trying to

219
00:10:21.785 --> 00:10:24.220
ease them at least for
a bit, so they'll go public.

220
00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:28.675
Title two of the Jobs Act

221
00:10:28.675 --> 00:10:32.370
is not about making it
easier to go public but

222
00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:35.715
it's more about making it
easier to stay private, okay.

223
00:10:35.715 --> 00:10:38.804
So for title two,

224
00:10:38.804 --> 00:10:40.980
what it's saying is that,

225
00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:44.765
okay so there's a regulation
called Regulation D

226
00:10:44.765 --> 00:10:48.790
and regulation D is one of the

227
00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:51.290
go-to regulation for companies

228
00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:53.180
that want to stay
private and want

229
00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:57.810
to raise money privately
without going public, okay.

230
00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:01.890
So historically they've
enjoyed this exemption

231
00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:08.845
from having to go public
under regulation D,

232
00:11:08.845 --> 00:11:11.730
which allows them to raise money.

233
00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:15.040
So they can do that. They can
raise money from friends,

234
00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:17.020
they can raise money
from friends of friends,

235
00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:18.370
they can raise money from people

236
00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:20.620
that they'd been referred to.

237
00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:23.830
But what they can't do,

238
00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:27.370
is bring in money by advertising,

239
00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:31.555
or what the SCC calls
general solicitation.

240
00:11:31.555 --> 00:11:33.085
You couldn't do that.

241
00:11:33.085 --> 00:11:36.940
You couldn't just put an ad
in the paper say call

242
00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:38.410
this number if you're interested

243
00:11:38.410 --> 00:11:41.290
in investing in our company.

244
00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:44.350
You couldn't advertise.

245
00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:47.770
So that is the big

246
00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:50.560
developed with title II
is that I can bring

247
00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:53.350
in money from outside investors

248
00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:56.575
that I bring in simply
by advertising.

249
00:11:56.575 --> 00:11:58.960
Now these days you do
that on the Internet.

250
00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:02.590
So you can do that,
but there's a catch.

251
00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:04.270
So basically, this
is crowdfunding.

252
00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:07.060
Titled II is a flavor
of crowdfunding.

253
00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:09.805
I'm putting myself out
there on the Internet,

254
00:12:09.805 --> 00:12:11.050
I'm describing a company,

255
00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:14.020
I'm telling you how you can
invest and you can invest,

256
00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:16.420
sounds like crowdfunding,
but there's a twist here

257
00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:19.315
which is that it's
only for rich people.

258
00:12:19.315 --> 00:12:21.625
When I say rich people,
what I mean is,

259
00:12:21.625 --> 00:12:25.885
to be an investor in a
Title II crowdfunding,

260
00:12:25.885 --> 00:12:28.885
you have to have
either number one,

261
00:12:28.885 --> 00:12:31.240
$1 million not counting

262
00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:33.355
your house, you have
to have $1 million,

263
00:12:33.355 --> 00:12:35.350
or if you don't
have a $1 million,

264
00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:37.615
you have to have made at least

265
00:12:37.615 --> 00:12:41.770
$200,000 for the last two years.

266
00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:48.655
So if you've satisfy those rules,

267
00:12:48.655 --> 00:12:50.754
those about wealth
income requirements,

268
00:12:50.754 --> 00:12:56.245
then the SCC would call
you an accredited investor

269
00:12:56.245 --> 00:13:02.425
and now you can invest
in that startup.

270
00:13:02.425 --> 00:13:04.675
By the way, the burden

271
00:13:04.675 --> 00:13:07.870
of proof essentially that

272
00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:10.690
you are accredited investor
is on the company,

273
00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:12.910
so I can't just say,

274
00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:14.125
"By the way, are you rich?"

275
00:13:14.125 --> 00:13:15.790
"Yeah, I'm rich."
So, "Okay, great.

276
00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:17.350
Well then you can
buy my securities."

277
00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:21.430
No. I have to have
a process in place to

278
00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:26.755
verify that you really
have that kind of money.

279
00:13:26.755 --> 00:13:29.740
So what you see now is there're

280
00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:35.050
some internet portals that
facilitate crowdfunding,

281
00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:36.190
but if you look closely,

282
00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:38.860
you'll see they're only doing

283
00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:42.684
Title II crowdfunding where

284
00:13:42.684 --> 00:13:45.160
in order to invest
through that portal,

285
00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:47.230
you have to go through
a process that they

286
00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:51.880
oversee where you
verify tax returns,

287
00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:54.640
you verify that you
have the income or

288
00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:56.995
wealth to be
an accredited investor.

289
00:13:56.995 --> 00:14:00.400
Once they've taken
care of that piece,

290
00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:03.070
then the startups can go to

291
00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:06.280
that website and they know
that well the website has

292
00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:08.920
done that vetting for

293
00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:12.100
them and now they
can raise money from

294
00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:18.685
those investors legally
while staying private.

295
00:14:18.685 --> 00:14:23.350
So Title II is a flavor
of crowdfunding,

296
00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:25.225
but just remember, Title II

297
00:14:25.225 --> 00:14:28.765
is crowdfunding for rich people.

298
00:14:28.765 --> 00:14:30.850
That brings this Title III,

299
00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:32.545
which is just crowdfunding
for everybody.

300
00:14:32.545 --> 00:14:40.660
So Title III says that I can
raise money from anybody.

301
00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:45.205
But now, relative to title II,

302
00:14:45.205 --> 00:14:47.290
there are some restrictions that

303
00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:49.510
we're going to have
to live under.

304
00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:51.685
So yes, I could raise
money from anybody,

305
00:14:51.685 --> 00:14:56.320
but people are
going to be limited

306
00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:58.600
in how much they can invest
and that limit's going to be

307
00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:01.195
a function of
their wealth or income.

308
00:15:01.195 --> 00:15:03.460
Also, I'm going to be limited

309
00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:06.040
in how much money I can raise.

310
00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:09.850
So to think about Title III,

311
00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:14.410
bear in mind that
the regulators care about,

312
00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:18.070
all investors, but
they particularly care

313
00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:21.595
about investors of limited means.

314
00:15:21.595 --> 00:15:24.040
That's what this whole accredited

315
00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:25.360
investor thing is all about.

316
00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:26.590
Well, if you're wealthy enough,

317
00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:30.790
you make enough money,
there's two things.

318
00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:33.760
Number one, maybe you're
more astute investor,

319
00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:34.705
for us maybe not.

320
00:15:34.705 --> 00:15:38.605
But also, you've
got money to lose

321
00:15:38.605 --> 00:15:42.850
and we're not as concerned

322
00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:46.750
there as we are for the
investors of more limited means,

323
00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:50.590
they're the ones that we
want to be careful about not

324
00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:52.990
getting ripped off or at least

325
00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:56.545
not investing to an extent,

326
00:15:56.545 --> 00:15:59.800
not losing a very damaging amount

327
00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:01.720
of money in this market.

328
00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:06.670
So the restrictions from
the entrepreneur side,

329
00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:08.530
I can raise over

330
00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:10.240
any 12-month period up to

331
00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:12.760
$1 million. That's
it, $1 million.

332
00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:19.195
I can raise $1 million and
when I go to this market,

333
00:16:19.195 --> 00:16:20.920
I don't have anything like

334
00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:29.275
the stringent auditing expenses

335
00:16:29.275 --> 00:16:31.780
and regulated review that

336
00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:33.910
we saw with the
traditional IPO process.

337
00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:36.280
So if I got this market,

338
00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:38.830
if I'm raising only
up to a $100,000,

339
00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:40.870
then all I need is

340
00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:43.825
a company official to sign
off on the documents.

341
00:16:43.825 --> 00:16:46.600
A company official
like I could just sign

342
00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:50.185
off that just my
disclosures being accurate.

343
00:16:50.185 --> 00:16:52.780
If I want to go up
to a half million,

344
00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:55.015
now I need to have

345
00:16:55.015 --> 00:16:58.360
my information reviewed
by a public accountant.

346
00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:00.430
Now, review is
a term of art here.

347
00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:02.695
Review and audit are
two different things.

348
00:17:02.695 --> 00:17:05.935
A review is less costly

349
00:17:05.935 --> 00:17:09.070
far fewer professional hours
than an audit.

350
00:17:09.070 --> 00:17:13.405
So I'd have to have it reviewed
by a public accountant,

351
00:17:13.405 --> 00:17:15.520
but I don't have
to have an audit.

352
00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:17.845
Once I'm over half million bucks,

353
00:17:17.845 --> 00:17:20.710
then if this is my first time,

354
00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:23.320
then I still just
have it reviewed,

355
00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:24.925
but if it's my second time

356
00:17:24.925 --> 00:17:26.635
going to the crowdfunding market,

357
00:17:26.635 --> 00:17:29.875
now I'm going to have
to pay for an audit.

358
00:17:29.875 --> 00:17:31.330
So as you can see,

359
00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:32.680
we're trying to because we're not

360
00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:34.150
raising much money here,

361
00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:37.060
we're only raising up to
a million bucks and so you

362
00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:38.860
have to be careful
about how expensive

363
00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:40.720
you're going to make it
to go to this market,

364
00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:46.420
and so that's the idea
here that we're not

365
00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:48.925
making the entrepreneur spend

366
00:17:48.925 --> 00:17:50.830
a tremendous amount
of professional hours

367
00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:52.510
if they're not raising
that much money.

368
00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:55.420
So that is the entrepreneur side.

369
00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:58.540
On the investor side,

370
00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:03.040
they said they are going
to be limited in how

371
00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:04.645
much they can invest

372
00:18:04.645 --> 00:18:07.915
depending on
their wealth and income.

373
00:18:07.915 --> 00:18:11.500
So basically, what it
boils down to is that

374
00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:15.849
if you make up to
a 100,000 bucks,

375
00:18:15.849 --> 00:18:19.855
then you are limited
to the greater of

376
00:18:19.855 --> 00:18:22.660
2,000 bucks a year that you can

377
00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:26.360
invest or five percent
of your income.

378
00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:31.000
So that's the idea.

379
00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.910
So if I'm making just
almost a 100,000 bucks and

380
00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:37.240
I can invest almost 5,000 bucks.

381
00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:39.640
All put together, all

382
00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:42.535
Title III crowdfunding
investment all put together,

383
00:18:42.535 --> 00:18:44.575
once I'm over 100,000,

384
00:18:44.575 --> 00:18:48.235
now it is 10 percent
of my income,

385
00:18:48.235 --> 00:18:51.530
up to 100,000 bucks.

386
00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:56.140
So even there, I'm limited.

387
00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:57.325
The idea as you can see,

388
00:18:57.325 --> 00:18:58.990
yes I might lose

389
00:18:58.990 --> 00:19:01.780
all my money that I invest
in crowdfunding but

390
00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:07.465
I'm not going to lose more
than 10 percent of my income.

391
00:19:07.465 --> 00:19:10.090
Also I should add that when

392
00:19:10.090 --> 00:19:12.475
you invest in this market
as an investor,

393
00:19:12.475 --> 00:19:16.600
you are actually limited
in your ability to sell.

394
00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:19.900
So over the next year,

395
00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:21.970
I can't sell my

396
00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:24.160
whenever I bought in
crowdfunding to anybody else.

397
00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:27.325
So this could be
no liquidity for a year.

398
00:19:27.325 --> 00:19:29.800
So there's one more title
that I mentioned of

399
00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:32.515
the jobs act which is Title IV.

400
00:19:32.515 --> 00:19:37.855
Title IV is what people
often refer to as Reg A+.

401
00:19:37.855 --> 00:19:43.075
Reg A+ because there has
been a Reg A for many years.

402
00:19:43.075 --> 00:19:45.955
Reg A+ is just a bit
of a twist on it.

403
00:19:45.955 --> 00:19:50.815
Reg A+ really isn't what anyone
would call crowdfunding.

404
00:19:50.815 --> 00:19:55.240
Reg A+ is a way
that a company can

405
00:19:55.240 --> 00:20:00.070
do essentially an IPO but
just on a smaller scale.

406
00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:02.170
If you are doing an IPO,

407
00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:06.640
but there's somewhat lighter
disclosure requirements,

408
00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:08.020
some other lighter
requirements and you're

409
00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:10.045
doing at a smaller size.

410
00:20:10.045 --> 00:20:14.680
So it's a way to allow
a company to do an IPO maybe in

411
00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:17.680
a slightly earlier moment

412
00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:21.530
than they otherwise would
and at a smaller size.

413
00:20:21.530 --> 00:20:26.260
So this really hasn't
taken off so much

414
00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:30.940
the way that the regulators
hoped it would as well.

415
00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:32.170
There's only been
a few of these and

416
00:20:32.170 --> 00:20:34.915
the performance hasn't
really been that great.

417
00:20:34.915 --> 00:20:36.730
As I say it's not really,

418
00:20:36.730 --> 00:20:38.080
I wouldn't call it crowdfunding,

419
00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:41.680
it really got more of
the flavor of a typical IPO.

420
00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:44.710
Maybe the one piece
that's like crowdfunding

421
00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:47.710
is that these are done on what

422
00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:51.265
we call a best
efforts basis which

423
00:20:51.265 --> 00:20:55.075
is not the usual way
an IPO is done.

424
00:20:55.075 --> 00:20:57.880
Usually, if I take
my company IPO,

425
00:20:57.880 --> 00:20:59.800
I hire an underwriter and

426
00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:02.050
ultimately what happens
is the underwriter

427
00:21:02.050 --> 00:21:04.510
buys the shares from

428
00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:08.110
the issuer and then places
those shares with the public.

429
00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:10.090
A best efforts IPO is

430
00:21:10.090 --> 00:21:12.205
where the underwriter
doesn't do any of that.

431
00:21:12.205 --> 00:21:15.160
They just provide a conduit

432
00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:18.175
for the retail public
or anyone or

433
00:21:18.175 --> 00:21:21.670
institutional investors
whoever it is to buy shares of

434
00:21:21.670 --> 00:21:25.600
the IPO and then at
the end of that process,

435
00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:27.820
the issuer has sold

436
00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:29.725
whatever shares people
showed up to buy.

437
00:21:29.725 --> 00:21:32.050
So that's a best efforts IPO.

438
00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:34.480
You tend not to see those
for the major companies,

439
00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:38.110
you see this for the
relatively smaller,

440
00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:40.750
sketchy, maybe you
call them companies,

441
00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:42.595
would do a best efforts IPO.

442
00:21:42.595 --> 00:21:46.870
So in this Title IV Reg+ base,

443
00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:48.250
that's also what
you're going to see.

444
00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:49.930
So the retail investor does have

445
00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:55.945
better access to these IPOs
than the typical IPO.

446
00:21:55.945 --> 00:21:58.090
They show up and buy shares,

447
00:21:58.090 --> 00:21:59.380
they can probably do it.

448
00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:00.670
So maybe that's got some of

449
00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:03.085
the little flavor of crowdfunding

450
00:22:03.085 --> 00:22:06.970
but for the most part now
this is just a regular IPO.

451
00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:09.535
It hasn't really
taken off either.

452
00:22:09.535 --> 00:22:10.840
But I just thought I'd mention it

453
00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:13.870
because it's the last piece
of the jobs Act.

454
00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:17.095
Going forward, my focus
here is going to be

455
00:22:17.095 --> 00:22:20.950
on the Title III
crowdfunding. So that's it.

456
00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:22.630
That's the job Act 1, 2, 3,

457
00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:26.090
and 4 and that's what's given us

458
00:22:26.490 --> 00:22:30.620
this new world of companies
you going directly to

459
00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:35.370
the retail markets to fund
their defender startups.
