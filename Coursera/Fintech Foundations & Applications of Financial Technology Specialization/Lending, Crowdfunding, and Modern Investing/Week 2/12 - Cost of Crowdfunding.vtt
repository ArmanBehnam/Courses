00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.435
So in this section,

2
00:00:06.435 --> 00:00:08.060
I want to think about,

3
00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.820
what does it cost to go to
this crowdfunding market?

4
00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.960
What it cost from the
entrepreneur's point of view,

5
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.260
and particularly, what does it

6
00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.240
cost from the investor's
point of view?

7
00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.310
So first from
the entrepreneur's point

8
00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.425
of view, you think about,

9
00:00:23.425 --> 00:00:26.225
what am I talking about
when I think about,

10
00:00:26.225 --> 00:00:29.200
going into this market

11
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.210
and raising up to
a million bucks, right?

12
00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.495
So anytime you do an offering,

13
00:00:34.495 --> 00:00:38.900
even with the reduced demands

14
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.140
on this market relative
to the traditional IPO,

15
00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.595
you're still talking about

16
00:00:42.595 --> 00:00:45.260
some considerable
professional time

17
00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:46.540
you're going to have to pay for.

18
00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.985
While it's you can't really
put an exact number on it.

19
00:00:49.985 --> 00:00:51.830
If you look around
people generally

20
00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:53.840
think of this as
being maybe about,

21
00:00:53.840 --> 00:01:02.380
100 hours of lawyer time
and accountant time.

22
00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.145
So it's there about.

23
00:01:05.145 --> 00:01:07.710
So let's use the number
100, all right.

24
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.890
So think about that's
just like one lawyer,

25
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.410
and one accountant putting
in one longish week,

26
00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:15.800
there you go, you've just

27
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.330
made your way to
a 100 hours, right?

28
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.250
So it's not really at
all a crazy amount of

29
00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.040
time to work on your offering.

30
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.260
So 100 hours, if they're charging

31
00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.660
you 500 bucks in hour total,

32
00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.640
and that's really probably
what you're thinking of,

33
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.335
something like 500 bucks an hour.

34
00:01:30.335 --> 00:01:33.080
Now, you're talking
about $50,000.

35
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.560
You just spent $50,000
just on the professionals,

36
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.830
just to go out there

37
00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.220
and list your offering and
hopefully people will invest.

38
00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.305
So it's 50,000 bucks.

39
00:01:45.305 --> 00:01:46.745
Now, think about it.

40
00:01:46.745 --> 00:01:48.320
If you're raising
a million bucks which

41
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.150
is all you can raise max,

42
00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.400
that is five percent, right?

43
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.400
So 50,000 bucks,
five percent of a million.

44
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.960
So you're spending off

45
00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.885
the top five percent
of the million bucks.

46
00:01:59.885 --> 00:02:03.530
So minimum professional
costs of like five percent,

47
00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.575
and then on top of that,

48
00:02:05.575 --> 00:02:07.550
on top of the money you're paying

49
00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.470
out to those professionals,

50
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:15.470
you also pay the Internet portal
that you list on, right?

51
00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.255
These guys that's how
do they make money?

52
00:02:18.255 --> 00:02:20.530
You know their intermediating
you're offering,

53
00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.925
but then they're going
to take a piece of it.

54
00:02:22.925 --> 00:02:27.485
There was an SEC study
that came out in

55
00:02:27.485 --> 00:02:33.740
early 2017 looking at all
of the Title III offerings,

56
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:40.610
from the first in May 2016
through the end of 2016,

57
00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.595
and they found a median fee
of five percent.

58
00:02:45.595 --> 00:02:51.510
If you look at
the Wefunder portal,

59
00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.560
which is the most active
where they document is

60
00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.865
the most active of
the Title III Portals,

61
00:02:57.865 --> 00:02:59.840
they'll tell you that they charge

62
00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.235
a fee of up to seven percent.

63
00:03:03.235 --> 00:03:07.230
So you've got
at least five percent

64
00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.705
of professional costs
that you're paying,

65
00:03:09.705 --> 00:03:13.590
and now you're paying
median five percent,

66
00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.015
could be higher, could be
seven percent to the portal.

67
00:03:18.015 --> 00:03:20.060
Also for the listing, of course,

68
00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.470
that's going to be
proportional to how much

69
00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.130
you actually bring in,

70
00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.880
but you're talking
about absolute minimum,

71
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.790
10 percent out the window,

72
00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.495
in costs to raise this money.

73
00:03:33.495 --> 00:03:35.415
So just bear that in mind.

74
00:03:35.415 --> 00:03:38.835
That doesn't cost even add in,

75
00:03:38.835 --> 00:03:41.430
just the cost of
the campaign itself, right?

76
00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.530
You're going to make a video.

77
00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.150
There's going to be other

78
00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.240
advertising material you
got to put together.

79
00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.900
There's all this expensive

80
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.180
your own time that you're
dedicating to this offering,

81
00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.475
as opposed to actually
working on your startup,

82
00:03:57.475 --> 00:03:59.360
and time everyone else involved.

83
00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.980
So it's expensive.

84
00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.955
This is a lot of just sort of,

85
00:04:04.955 --> 00:04:09.370
just effort, hours, dollars,

86
00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.080
that you are putting
into this offering.

87
00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.830
So that's expensive.

88
00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:16.790
But now let's look
it from the point of

89
00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:18.845
view of the investors.

90
00:04:18.845 --> 00:04:23.420
If you are thinking of
investing in this space.

91
00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:24.500
So let's just think of this.

92
00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.290
Let's work through a little
simple example, just to get,

93
00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.765
to once again just a back
of the envelope sense of

94
00:04:29.765 --> 00:04:32.780
what it costs to invest
in crowdfunding.

95
00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.190
So let's say you make a
100,000. Make a 100,000 bucks.

96
00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.235
So I just told you that if
you make a 100,000 bucks,

97
00:04:40.235 --> 00:04:42.770
you get to invest

98
00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.415
10 percent of that in
crowdfunding over a year.

99
00:04:46.415 --> 00:04:49.010
So you've got 10,000
bucks to play

100
00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.340
with in investing
in crowdfunding.

101
00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.950
So let's say like
most investors you think well,

102
00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:58.095
I'm not going to
put it all in one,

103
00:04:58.095 --> 00:05:00.270
I'm going to spread it
around a little bit.

104
00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.590
So I think I'm going
to take my 10,000,

105
00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.125
I'm going to divide
that five ways.

106
00:05:07.125 --> 00:05:09.900
I expect I'm going make five

107
00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.670
$2,000 investments over
the course of the year.

108
00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:17.645
So I'm just going to
watch the webpages,

109
00:05:17.645 --> 00:05:22.230
and you'll see the offerings
cross the screen,

110
00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:24.000
and then once in a while,

111
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.395
I'm going to see something,

112
00:05:25.395 --> 00:05:30.915
that sounds like a possibility.

113
00:05:30.915 --> 00:05:33.825
Then I'm going to check it out,

114
00:05:33.825 --> 00:05:35.235
and if it checks out,

115
00:05:35.235 --> 00:05:37.130
then Then they're
going to get one

116
00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:40.345
of my $2,000 investments.

117
00:05:40.345 --> 00:05:44.535
By the way, just looking
at the Wefunder page,

118
00:05:44.535 --> 00:05:47.120
yesterday as I was
putting this together,

119
00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.770
and what did I see?

120
00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:52.460
Well, I saw here they list,

121
00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:55.340
they headline the ones

122
00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.155
that are getting
a lot of attraction.

123
00:05:57.155 --> 00:05:59.930
So here's the first
ones that I saw.

124
00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:01.820
I just give you a sense of
what you're looking at.

125
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:05.585
So I saw Mister B& B,
that was the first one.

126
00:06:05.585 --> 00:06:07.580
Is described themselves as

127
00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.225
the largest gay travel
community in the world.

128
00:06:10.225 --> 00:06:12.140
So that's how you
can invest in it.

129
00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:15.905
In this sort of travel service.

130
00:06:15.905 --> 00:06:18.950
There's one called Liquidpiston.

131
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:21.440
Where they say they're developing

132
00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.545
a new internal combustion engine.

133
00:06:24.545 --> 00:06:27.630
Then there's one called
Medford Brewing Company.

134
00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:28.950
What do they do?
Well, they make beer.

135
00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:30.720
They've won some awards.

136
00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:34.440
Then there's MySwimPro.

137
00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:35.640
What's MySwimPro?

138
00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:42.250
Well, this is an app that you
have on your Apple watch,

139
00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:47.480
that you have on
you while you swim.

140
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.130
It gives you feedback,

141
00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:55.090
and I guess optimizes
your swimming.

142
00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:59.485
So this is, you see
things like that,

143
00:06:59.485 --> 00:07:01.960
and one of those might say,

144
00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.015
okay, all right, I can see that.

145
00:07:04.015 --> 00:07:05.740
Then you think, "Well, okay,

146
00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:07.790
should they get my
2,000 bucks or not? "

147
00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:09.680
So you're at that point.

148
00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:10.730
You finally see one.

149
00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:15.035
Yes, I think I sense
some potential here.

150
00:07:15.035 --> 00:07:17.330
But like any other investor

151
00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:19.825
I feel like I have
to check it out.

152
00:07:19.825 --> 00:07:22.545
So let's think about
checking it out,

153
00:07:22.545 --> 00:07:25.235
and what that would cost you.

154
00:07:25.235 --> 00:07:26.960
So you're going to check it out,

155
00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:29.120
and so you're going
to be spending

156
00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.820
some time looking at this,

157
00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:35.695
figuring out, doing
your diligence,

158
00:07:35.695 --> 00:07:38.720
is this really
a positive NPV way to

159
00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:39.980
spend your money as we would say

160
00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:42.080
here in our finance
classes at Wharton?

161
00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:43.580
So you got to check it out,

162
00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:44.930
this can take you some time.

163
00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:46.250
What's it going to cost you?

164
00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:47.960
Well, to ballpark,
what it's going to

165
00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:50.045
cost you. Let's think
of it this way.

166
00:07:50.045 --> 00:07:53.714
So we assume that you made
a 100,000 bucks a year,

167
00:07:53.714 --> 00:07:55.150
100,000 bucks a year,

168
00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:58.235
that's about 50 bucks an
hour that you're making.

169
00:07:58.235 --> 00:08:00.530
So let's think about billing,

170
00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:04.310
you billing your own time
at 50 bucks an hour,

171
00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:06.775
since that's what you make.

172
00:08:06.775 --> 00:08:12.580
Let's say you've picked

173
00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:16.565
something that you have
some comfort with already.

174
00:08:16.565 --> 00:08:20.330
If you're thinking
about that brewery,

175
00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:22.190
then you like beer

176
00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:26.975
and maybe you've made
your own beer at some point,

177
00:08:26.975 --> 00:08:29.480
you've source beer ingredients,

178
00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:34.610
maybe you have some experience
in the restaurant world,

179
00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:36.470
whatever you got,
you have some base

180
00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:37.790
of knowledge you're building on.

181
00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:39.110
So let's say it's not
going to take you

182
00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:40.970
that long to check it out.

183
00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:44.120
So how about one day?

184
00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.840
This will take you one-day,

185
00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:48.990
one workday, instead
of doing any work,

186
00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:50.850
instead of going
outside, whatever it is,

187
00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:52.485
you're just going to stay in,

188
00:08:52.485 --> 00:08:54.570
spend one workday
checking this out.

189
00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:57.330
So one workday, so
about eight hours,

190
00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:59.655
eight hours 50 bucks an hour,

191
00:08:59.655 --> 00:09:02.715
you're talking about
a 400 bucks, right?

192
00:09:02.715 --> 00:09:04.410
Eight times 50 is 400 bucks.

193
00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:07.260
So it's going to
cost you 400 bucks.

194
00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.270
Sort of, maybe not

195
00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:11.780
cash out of your pocket
because you just sort of,

196
00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:13.100
you're talking about
your own time here,

197
00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:14.405
but about 400 bucks

198
00:09:14.405 --> 00:09:17.210
opportunity costs of
checking this out.

199
00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:19.670
So you spend 400 bucks and

200
00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:22.745
then there's some chance
at the end of that,

201
00:09:22.745 --> 00:09:26.475
that it will check out
and you will invest.

202
00:09:26.475 --> 00:09:29.250
What's the chance that
it will check out?

203
00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:30.770
Well, of course, you
don't really know for

204
00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:32.510
sure what's the chances
it's going to check out.

205
00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:34.880
But let's just say,
just so we can

206
00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.475
keep going with our back of
the envelope calculation.

207
00:09:37.475 --> 00:09:40.400
Let's say you put up
a 50 percent chance,

208
00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.650
that at the end of the day

209
00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:45.325
that whatever you
learn during that day,

210
00:09:45.325 --> 00:09:47.260
is going to tell you,

211
00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:48.695
go ahead, go ahead and do it.

212
00:09:48.695 --> 00:09:52.595
It's worth it. So if
you think about it,

213
00:09:52.595 --> 00:09:55.625
if you're spending 400 bucks to

214
00:09:55.625 --> 00:09:59.675
checkout an investment
of 2,000 bucks.

215
00:09:59.675 --> 00:10:04.760
Then it's only a half chance

216
00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:06.050
that you're actually
going to make

217
00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:08.600
the investment once you've
done your homework.

218
00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:09.995
If you think about it,

219
00:10:09.995 --> 00:10:15.320
the expected profit
on this investment,

220
00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:17.990
the expected return on

221
00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:20.765
that 2,000 bucks over
and above whatever

222
00:10:20.765 --> 00:10:23.570
else you could have done
with that 2,000 bucks

223
00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:27.170
is going to have to
be 800 bucks, right?

224
00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:29.720
Because, you know,
you're spending $400,

225
00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:30.710
it's only a half chance you're

226
00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:31.790
going to make the investments.

227
00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:33.980
So conditional on
making the investment,

228
00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:36.860
you'd have to expect ex-ante,

229
00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:42.170
but that's going to be
at least 800 bucks to offset

230
00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:44.450
the 400 that you are

231
00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:47.900
spending whether you end
up investing or not.

232
00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:51.590
Okay, so you think about it.

233
00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:52.820
I could take that 2,000 bucks,

234
00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:54.740
just put it in the market.

235
00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:57.020
As I could've done
that, and that's

236
00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:59.390
basically no transactions costs

237
00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:00.815
at all, just put in the market.

238
00:11:00.815 --> 00:11:03.590
So this has got to be
800 bucks over and

239
00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:05.780
above what I would

240
00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:07.385
have made I'm just
putting in the market,

241
00:11:07.385 --> 00:11:12.650
because 800 bucks and
2,000 is 40 percent.

242
00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:14.810
We're not saying you need
to make that 40 percent

243
00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:15.890
all in one year,

244
00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:19.280
but you need to think
of that 40 percent

245
00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:23.330
above market return as

246
00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:27.180
eventually happening over
the course of your investment.

247
00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:29.735
I don't know. Does
that sound realistic?

248
00:11:29.735 --> 00:11:33.500
That after a day
of your scrutiny,

249
00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:37.350
that the conditional
expected return,

250
00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:41.450
conditional of
surviving a one day

251
00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:43.400
of scrutiny for you is that high,

252
00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:46.595
not only as it's positive
but it's that positive.

253
00:11:46.595 --> 00:11:49.040
Bear in mind, if the chance

254
00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:52.640
that the company survives

255
00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:55.340
your scrutiny is
less than a half,

256
00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:59.689
then the conditional profit,

257
00:11:59.689 --> 00:12:01.430
conditional on
passing your scrutiny

258
00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:02.690
is going to have to be

259
00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:06.695
even higher than that 800 bucks.

260
00:12:06.695 --> 00:12:12.365
So as that probability goes
down and down and down,

261
00:12:12.365 --> 00:12:16.550
of the company actually surviving
your screen, of course,

262
00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:17.630
eventually gets to the point

263
00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:20.660
where it's just not worth it to

264
00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:24.830
spend 400 bucks because
they're doing the scrutiny,

265
00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:29.030
because the chance that
the expected profit is so high,

266
00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:31.010
as to justify that 400 bucks

267
00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:32.450
as the probability
goes down, down,

268
00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:37.700
down, is going to start
to being ridiculous.

269
00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:38.885
So that's just not going,

270
00:12:38.885 --> 00:12:40.499
that's just not realistic,

271
00:12:40.499 --> 00:12:46.565
that this spending of
400 bucks is going to pay off.

272
00:12:46.565 --> 00:12:50.420
Okay, so an alternative
would be, well,

273
00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:55.790
don't make so costly
in investment,

274
00:12:55.790 --> 00:13:00.980
in diligence, to check
out a $2,000 investment.

275
00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:06.470
Don't spend all that money,

276
00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:12.140
just rely instead
on your own sense,

277
00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:13.940
that you're going to stick to

278
00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:16.685
something that you know
a whole lot about.

279
00:13:16.685 --> 00:13:19.864
I'll invest in a brewery

280
00:13:19.864 --> 00:13:24.020
but only if I really know
a lot about breweries.

281
00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:26.870
I really think that
just by reading

282
00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:31.325
the description and just
doing a small amount of work,

283
00:13:31.325 --> 00:13:35.435
I can figure out if this is
a positive investment or not.

284
00:13:35.435 --> 00:13:39.320
Don't invest in that new
combustion engine unless

285
00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:41.540
you're an auto mechanic
or someone who

286
00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:44.225
really knows about
internal combustion engines.

287
00:13:44.225 --> 00:13:45.590
Don't even bother going

288
00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:48.950
there unless you really
know a lot so much that you

289
00:13:48.950 --> 00:13:51.455
can make this kind of
investment without making

290
00:13:51.455 --> 00:13:56.780
a big expensive commitment
of your own time.

291
00:13:56.780 --> 00:14:00.890
Okay, so you could do that.

292
00:14:00.890 --> 00:14:02.870
You can certainly invest
that way if you want to,

293
00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:06.395
but I think it's worth
asking yourself.

294
00:14:06.395 --> 00:14:09.890
Do you really think that

295
00:14:09.890 --> 00:14:12.830
the expected return on that is

296
00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:16.265
going to be positive? Do
you really think that?

297
00:14:16.265 --> 00:14:20.015
Could be, but bear in mind

298
00:14:20.015 --> 00:14:24.035
that there's a couple of
headwinds to worry about here.

299
00:14:24.035 --> 00:14:27.965
So number one, when you
invest in the public markets,

300
00:14:27.965 --> 00:14:30.020
if I want to invest in Tesla.

301
00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:31.250
I want to invest in Tesla.

302
00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:33.500
Well, the price of

303
00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:36.560
Tesla in the public markets
is at a market price.

304
00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:40.790
It is an equilibrium where
supply and demand meet,

305
00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:42.800
people are treating
Tesla all the time,

306
00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:44.630
people who are bearish on Tesla,

307
00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:46.310
people who are bullish on Tesla,

308
00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:48.785
people can short sell,
people can buy it.

309
00:14:48.785 --> 00:14:50.810
All those pressures up and

310
00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:53.240
down meet at this market price.

311
00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:55.910
So there's a sense in which it is

312
00:14:55.910 --> 00:15:00.035
the product of
all these market pressures.

313
00:15:00.035 --> 00:15:01.250
It's given us this price.

314
00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:04.370
Whereas, if I'm looking at
this crowdfunding site,

315
00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:05.570
where there's a price there,

316
00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:07.520
that's not a market price.

317
00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:09.110
That's just what they're asking.

318
00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:12.470
It's not the equilibrium result

319
00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:15.260
of pressures from people who
are positive or negative.

320
00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.780
It's just the number
that they came up with.

321
00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:19.565
So I don't have

322
00:15:19.565 --> 00:15:22.370
that fall back that you
have in the public markets,

323
00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:24.770
that even if I don't
know what I'm doing,

324
00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:26.360
if I don't buy Tesla,

325
00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:28.385
I don't really know about

326
00:15:28.385 --> 00:15:34.370
all those product lines
that Tesla produces.

327
00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:40.190
I could really not know
anything about the business,

328
00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:42.110
and yet I'm paying a price

329
00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:44.300
that because the market
price is a sense in

330
00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:48.725
which I'm not getting ripped off.

331
00:15:48.725 --> 00:15:50.630
This is a price
that in some sense,

332
00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:51.755
the market has agreed,

333
00:15:51.755 --> 00:15:53.705
is the right price for Tesla.

334
00:15:53.705 --> 00:15:56.795
So that's not what's
happening when I'm

335
00:15:56.795 --> 00:15:59.780
investing in this private market.

336
00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:01.400
I'm just paying the price
as they quoted.

337
00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:04.025
It doesn't make sense or not.

338
00:16:04.025 --> 00:16:05.510
Well, I don't know.
I just need to

339
00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:07.730
figure that out myself.

340
00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:10.729
Then also bear in
mind, in crowdfunding,

341
00:16:10.729 --> 00:16:13.410
you have to keep asking yourself,

342
00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:20.150
"Is crowdfunding like a last
resort for these companies?"

343
00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:21.530
Or put it another way,

344
00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:22.790
"If I were them,

345
00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:26.300
is this the first place I
would look for funding?"

346
00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:29.120
Probably, it isn't
the first place I would look.

347
00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:32.210
Probably, the first place
would be family and friends.

348
00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:34.580
Then if I can't raise

349
00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:36.560
money from family and
friends, they're tapped out.

350
00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:40.700
I just don't have
wealthy family or friends.

351
00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:44.030
So that's not really an option.
Well, now I want to go,

352
00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:45.890
might go to a bank.

353
00:16:45.890 --> 00:16:48.230
I might see if there's
a venture capitalist

354
00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:49.730
I can get interested in this.

355
00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:53.375
So I would go those routes,

356
00:16:53.375 --> 00:16:55.550
go into the crowdfunding site,

357
00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:57.110
and all those expenses that we

358
00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:59.180
talked about are going
to crowdfunding.

359
00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:03.590
Well, that's it. In many cases,

360
00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:05.180
it maybe hard to believe

361
00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:07.490
that will be
the first place I go.

362
00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:09.875
So there's a sense in which this,

363
00:17:09.875 --> 00:17:11.630
what you see in
the crowdfunding site in

364
00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:14.735
many cases, is picked over.

365
00:17:14.735 --> 00:17:18.080
These are some extent
the companies

366
00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:21.455
that couldn't be
funded some other way,

367
00:17:21.455 --> 00:17:22.610
and if that's the case,

368
00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:27.995
then that's potential
concern point

369
00:17:27.995 --> 00:17:31.835
for you as an investor.

370
00:17:31.835 --> 00:17:34.700
So really, if you

371
00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:37.100
think that's already been
picked over like that,

372
00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:39.440
that could be such a high
concern that you'd say, "Well,

373
00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:41.090
look, I'm just not going to put

374
00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:43.160
my money in this unless I can

375
00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:45.140
really believe a story in

376
00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:47.555
which this isn't
the last resort."

377
00:17:47.555 --> 00:17:51.155
So that's where you would
be asking yourself this,

378
00:17:51.155 --> 00:17:53.780
"Why might crowdfunding
not be a last resort?"

379
00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:56.840
Well, one story that
you'll hear and you

380
00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:58.340
might just ask yourself

381
00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:00.440
does this apply in
this case or not,

382
00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:03.020
is that I'm going to
the crowdfunding market

383
00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:05.585
as a proof of concept.

384
00:18:05.585 --> 00:18:08.150
I'm going to
the crowdfunding market

385
00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:12.065
before going to the
venture capitalists,

386
00:18:12.065 --> 00:18:14.240
so I can show them look

387
00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:17.495
at the potential demand is
going to be for my product.

388
00:18:17.495 --> 00:18:20.945
I have the Gaye Travel Club,

389
00:18:20.945 --> 00:18:22.460
so I think I

390
00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:24.440
could make the case to
the venture capitalists,

391
00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:27.020
but I bet I can get
a better deal if I can first

392
00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:31.295
go to the Wefunder,

393
00:18:31.295 --> 00:18:33.110
see what I get for
investment there,

394
00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:35.120
and then I can go to the
venture capitalists again.

395
00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:37.235
I can say, "See," and probably

396
00:18:37.235 --> 00:18:39.470
that travel club is
going to do that

397
00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:42.080
because they see they
were the top listed one.

398
00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:43.910
Wefunder, they're probably
doing quite well,

399
00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:45.920
and that probably
isn't asset for them.

400
00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:48.215
Now, then go to
venture capitalists.

401
00:18:48.215 --> 00:18:50.370
So there you can see

402
00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:55.880
there's a very plausible story
in which this is

403
00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:58.520
not a last resort financing,

404
00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:01.550
or it can also be
that similar idea.

405
00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:05.675
I go to the Crowdfunder site in

406
00:19:05.675 --> 00:19:10.175
order to get shareholders
who will then be customers.

407
00:19:10.175 --> 00:19:14.090
So very often, people are
shareholders and company

408
00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:17.870
will tilt towards
patronizing that company.

409
00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:20.810
I experienced it's
an extreme version of this.

410
00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:24.095
When I was a kid, I remember
our stove stopped working,

411
00:19:24.095 --> 00:19:27.140
and we were talking
in our family, "Well,

412
00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:29.120
maybe we should buy a GE stove

413
00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:31.100
to replace it," because
we owned shares in GE.

414
00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:34.025
We didn't own many but we
own some shares in GE.

415
00:19:34.025 --> 00:19:35.690
I remember thinking
at the time, "Geez,

416
00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:37.070
I don't think a whole lot
of this is going to

417
00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:38.600
come back to us
through our shares,"

418
00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:40.040
but we did buy

419
00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:44.525
a GE stove which then didn't
really work that well.

420
00:19:44.525 --> 00:19:46.925
But that was an example there

421
00:19:46.925 --> 00:19:50.720
of just shareholders
becoming customers.

422
00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:52.850
Well, that's going to
be towards much more

423
00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:55.940
meaningful in the context
of crowdfunding.

424
00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:57.470
You think about the brewery,

425
00:19:57.470 --> 00:19:59.660
that I'm a customer,

426
00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:01.160
I buy shares in the brewery,

427
00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:02.840
and now I go to a bar.

428
00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:03.920
They've got that beer.

429
00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:05.360
Yeah, I'm buying it.
I'm going to buy that.

430
00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:07.340
Hey, this is my company.
I buy it for my friends.

431
00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:08.390
"Hey, why don't try some of

432
00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:09.740
my beer and see what you think."

433
00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:13.070
So there's another reason why
I might go to crowdfunding

434
00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:16.910
first before going into
the venture capitalist,

435
00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:18.380
saying, "Look, I've
got these guys

436
00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:20.180
who were, they've bought in.

437
00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:21.860
They're going to be

438
00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:25.250
customers and evangelist
for the product."

439
00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:29.555
So if you can convince yourself
that the story like that,

440
00:20:29.555 --> 00:20:31.940
that's a play here,

441
00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:34.265
then that might give you

442
00:20:34.265 --> 00:20:37.070
some comfort that this
isn't just the picked

443
00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:40.760
over leaving from
the more professional part

444
00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:41.930
of the finance industry.

445
00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:45.440
This is in fact a prologue
to going there,

446
00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:48.859
and that could be a situation

447
00:20:48.859 --> 00:20:52.385
where we're investing could
make some positive sense.

448
00:20:52.385 --> 00:20:56.420
Okay, so just to summarize here,

449
00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:58.460
I think the main thing
you see is that

450
00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:02.030
it's hard to justify,

451
00:21:02.030 --> 00:21:04.085
just as a
back-of-the-envelope sense,

452
00:21:04.085 --> 00:21:06.215
making much of an effort

453
00:21:06.215 --> 00:21:08.210
to check out a
crowdfunding investment.

454
00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:12.140
The limits are just
so low that you don't

455
00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:14.030
have to put too
much of a value on

456
00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:16.535
your time to get to
the point where, "Geez,

457
00:21:16.535 --> 00:21:20.345
I just cannot believe that

458
00:21:20.345 --> 00:21:26.420
cost could be justified in
the actual prospects of

459
00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:29.240
the company going forward,"

460
00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:34.655
but it could be
another story at work

461
00:21:34.655 --> 00:21:38.360
where crowdfunding is serving
a purpose that's then going

462
00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:40.100
to play a role

463
00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:43.865
later when the company
approaches such investors later.

464
00:21:43.865 --> 00:21:45.980
In that case, it's

465
00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:48.950
a more positive story
for getting involved in

466
00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:52.925
the company and
maybe a better prognosis

467
00:21:52.925 --> 00:21:55.530
for profits in the future.
