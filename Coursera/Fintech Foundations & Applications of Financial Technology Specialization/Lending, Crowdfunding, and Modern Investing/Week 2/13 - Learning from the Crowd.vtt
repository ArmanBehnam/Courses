1
00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:08.280
Okay. So crowdfunding is

2
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.180
not just raising
money from the crowd.

3
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.000
It's also, in some sense,

4
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.040
potentially learning
from the crowd.

5
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.380
If I'm investing in crowdfunding,

6
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.894
I can potentially learn about

7
00:00:24.894 --> 00:00:28.555
the value of an investment from

8
00:00:28.555 --> 00:00:32.380
the demand coming in
from other investors.

9
00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.065
When we talked about how
the price that I'm paying,

10
00:00:35.065 --> 00:00:39.220
the price that I'm paying
is not a market set price.

11
00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.530
It's an issuer set price.

12
00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:42.865
They just put their price of

13
00:00:42.865 --> 00:00:45.365
$10 or a share, whatever it is.

14
00:00:45.365 --> 00:00:47.330
They put it out there,
you like it or not.

15
00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.850
So how do I learn about whether

16
00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.480
$10 is a reasonable price?

17
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.780
Well, okay, I'm going to have
to find out some other way.

18
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.295
One of those ways is to observe

19
00:01:01.295 --> 00:01:03.815
the demand coming in
from other people.

20
00:01:03.815 --> 00:01:09.080
Okay. So the issuers help you,

21
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.450
they help you learn

22
00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.440
a potentially beneficial way from

23
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.725
the crowd by setting a minimum.

24
00:01:18.725 --> 00:01:22.310
So you look at the offerings
in a crowdfunding website.

25
00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.200
You'll see they've got a maximum,

26
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.420
but they've got a minimum too.

27
00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.550
The minimum helps you in

28
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:30.680
the sense that you
can say, "Okay.

29
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.860
Well, I'll put 2,000
bucks in this company."

30
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.480
They've set a minimum
of 50,000 bucks.

31
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:44.460
So if they don't
get at least 50,000

32
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:52.050
bucks in investment from
everyone put together,

33
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:53.840
the whole thing is
going to be called off.

34
00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.050
I always get my 2,000 bucks back.

35
00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.090
So I know that when I say,

36
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.070
"I'm investing 2,000
bucks," I'm not

37
00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.220
actually investing 2,000 bucks,

38
00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.475
unless there's that
much other demand.

39
00:02:08.475 --> 00:02:14.030
So that gives me potentially
a little confidence there,

40
00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.410
a little hope that, well,

41
00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.455
okay, maybe I got it wrong.

42
00:02:18.455 --> 00:02:21.035
Maybe this isn't
such a great idea.

43
00:02:21.035 --> 00:02:27.020
But how wrong could I be
if there's this total

44
00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:33.060
of 50,000 bucks coming
in from other people?

45
00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.410
I've got the crowd,

46
00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.360
at least some kind of crowd,

47
00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.075
on my side if we crossed
that 50,000 threshold.

48
00:02:43.075 --> 00:02:44.580
If we don't, well, then I
just get my money back.

49
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.700
So the investment
simply never happens.

50
00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.060
So this is an example

51
00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.510
of at least banking on or
hoping for the wisdom of

52
00:02:53.510 --> 00:03:03.390
the crowd that each person
in a crowd knows something.

53
00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.830
If you could just put together

54
00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.300
all those different things

55
00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.640
that the people in
the crowd know,

56
00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.565
that if you aggregate all
of their information,

57
00:03:13.565 --> 00:03:15.740
then the aggregative information,

58
00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.750
it could actually be
quite informative.

59
00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.275
So let's think about this now.

60
00:03:19.275 --> 00:03:22.230
This is not new ideas
and old idea that

61
00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.950
there's wisdom of the crowds and

62
00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:32.000
collectively decision
in general made by

63
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.670
a crowd are better informed

64
00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.840
than the decision made by
any one person in the crowd.

65
00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.520
This is a question that

66
00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.220
economists have
thought about a lot.

67
00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.105
Let me just give you a sense

68
00:03:47.105 --> 00:03:49.190
of how economists
think about this.

69
00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.530
I think the best context for

70
00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.665
me to think about
this is actually

71
00:03:54.665 --> 00:03:57.865
outside of the
financial markets and

72
00:03:57.865 --> 00:04:01.560
in the judicial world.

73
00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.860
So here's what I mean
by this. Imagine you

74
00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.055
find yourself on a jury.

75
00:04:08.055 --> 00:04:10.005
You got jury duty,

76
00:04:10.005 --> 00:04:12.690
and so you go down
to the courthouse.

77
00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.115
Then, by the end of the day,

78
00:04:14.115 --> 00:04:17.540
you're on a jury for
a criminal trial.

79
00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:18.740
So it's 12 people,

80
00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:21.850
12 jurors for a criminal trial.

81
00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.610
So you sit through the trial and

82
00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.690
you see all the evidence,
all the testimony.

83
00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:34.010
Then, finally, closing
statements, jurors are charged.

84
00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.455
They go to the jury room.

85
00:04:36.455 --> 00:04:38.510
Now, finally, they start

86
00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.160
discussing the case
with each other.

87
00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.770
All right. So they discuss
the case with each other.

88
00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.580
Then, at the end of the
discussion, then they say, "Okay.

89
00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.730
Well, how about we have a vote?"

90
00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:53.030
They have a vote. Then
think of the vote happening

91
00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.860
this way that you're going
to do it by a secret ballot.

92
00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.560
You can do the votes
different ways,

93
00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.520
but let's say, you're going
to do it by a secret ballot.

94
00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.000
So everyone's going
to write down on

95
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.340
a piece of paper
guilty or not guilty.

96
00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.250
Everyone tosses
their vote into a hat.

97
00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.430
Then the foreman takes
them out the the hat,

98
00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.935
reads them, counts them up.

99
00:05:12.935 --> 00:05:19.980
Then, if all 12 of you
have voted guilty,

100
00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:21.420
well, then that's it.

101
00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:25.880
That's what it means
for a jury to convict.

102
00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.160
All 12 you have voted guilty.

103
00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.310
That's what it
takes. So let's say,

104
00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:36.720
you're sitting there,
you've discussed it,

105
00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:42.930
and you have more

106
00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.590
than a reasonable doubt
about the defendant's guilt.

107
00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:51.230
So you think reasonably
that the threshold is here,

108
00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:55.020
but you have
more doubt than that.

109
00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:57.685
So you think, "Well, okay.

110
00:05:57.685 --> 00:06:01.550
I have more doubt than just
beyond a reasonable doubt.

111
00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:07.315
So I guess that means I
should vote not guilty."

112
00:06:07.315 --> 00:06:11.460
I would say, just
personally, I think yes,

113
00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:13.845
it does mean you should
vote not guilty,

114
00:06:13.845 --> 00:06:15.740
but let's think about how

115
00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:18.510
you might think
through this problem.

116
00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:22.280
This is the way economists
have thought about this,

117
00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.485
and maybe we're
worried a bit about

118
00:06:24.485 --> 00:06:30.185
the collective wisdom
of the group of jurors.

119
00:06:30.185 --> 00:06:32.275
You might look at it
this way that, look,

120
00:06:32.275 --> 00:06:35.300
I could vote not guilty
and maybe in some sense,

121
00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.865
that's the right vote because
I have that much doubt.

122
00:06:37.865 --> 00:06:40.400
But suppose I vote guilty.

123
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.400
Suppose I vote guilty.
Well, my vote of

124
00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.295
guilty does not actually convict

125
00:06:46.295 --> 00:06:48.170
the defendant unless

126
00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:53.645
all 11 other people
also vote guilty.

127
00:06:53.645 --> 00:07:00.260
Now, I have some doubts
about this case, but now,

128
00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.705
if you tell me that
all 11 other people

129
00:07:02.705 --> 00:07:06.140
think this defendant is guilty
beyond a reasonable doubt,

130
00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:07.340
and of course, I know that they

131
00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:08.570
know things that I don't know.

132
00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:10.070
They come from
different walks of life.

133
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:12.260
They have different perspectives.

134
00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.080
They maybe have their own ways of

135
00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:18.200
judging the credibility of
witnesses and all that.

136
00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.120
So they know things
that I don't know.

137
00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:21.515
I could know things
they don't know.

138
00:07:21.515 --> 00:07:23.615
But there's 11 of
them and one of me.

139
00:07:23.615 --> 00:07:25.970
So if all 11 of them think

140
00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:28.265
this person's guilty
beyond a reasonable doubt,

141
00:07:28.265 --> 00:07:31.730
well, that contains
information for me.

142
00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:33.580
That's going to
lower my own doubt,

143
00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:34.910
and maybe it lowers

144
00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:36.840
my own doubt to the point
where, actually,

145
00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:38.130
I don't have much doubt anymore,

146
00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:40.315
and I should now given
that much doubt.

147
00:07:40.315 --> 00:07:42.095
I think guilty is the right vote.

148
00:07:42.095 --> 00:07:44.585
So what I'm saying
is when I think,

149
00:07:44.585 --> 00:07:45.920
"Should vote guilty
or not guilty?"

150
00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:48.350
I might be thinking,
"Well, maybe I should vote

151
00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:51.285
guilty despite my doubts.

152
00:07:51.285 --> 00:07:52.725
Maybe I should vote guilty."

153
00:07:52.725 --> 00:07:55.550
Because the only situation in

154
00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:58.790
which it actually matters
that I voted guilty,

155
00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:00.785
where that actually
convicts the person,

156
00:08:00.785 --> 00:08:02.030
well, that's the state
of the world,

157
00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:03.740
where all 11 other people think

158
00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:05.795
the person is guilty
beyond a reasonable doubt.

159
00:08:05.795 --> 00:08:07.610
If that many people think that,

160
00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:09.550
well, then I think that too.

161
00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:14.735
So that kind of thinking
could cause me to

162
00:08:14.735 --> 00:08:21.200
disregard my own doubts and
then vote guilty when really,

163
00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:27.110
by rights, the right vote
should be not guilty for me.

164
00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:33.470
So this is non-financial
market here,

165
00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:37.385
but the point here is that

166
00:08:37.385 --> 00:08:41.540
the criminal justice system
depends on this idea

167
00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:43.730
that when you have
these 12 jurors that

168
00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:46.370
there's a wisdom of
crowds here that well,

169
00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:48.500
we need all 12 people to think

170
00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:50.620
this is guilty beyond
a reasonable doubt,

171
00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:52.790
that's what it takes
to convict a person.

172
00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:55.820
But in that context,

173
00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:57.560
if all 11 other people are

174
00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:01.530
really sincerely voting guilty,

175
00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:03.675
only if that's
sincerely they think,

176
00:09:03.675 --> 00:09:07.040
then to the 12 persons,

177
00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:08.240
it could be totally rational.

178
00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:09.980
I'm not saying this is
ethical but totally

179
00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:13.410
rational to just go
ahead and vote guilty.

180
00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:17.370
So it's not at all

181
00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:20.660
clear that the criminal
justice system is

182
00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:23.510
really aggregating
information quite

183
00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:26.900
the way we would think it is.

184
00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:30.560
I put this out to your own
experience introspection.

185
00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:33.155
I mean, you've seen
criminal trials.

186
00:09:33.155 --> 00:09:35.900
Do you think that the outcome

187
00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:38.270
of criminal trials is really such

188
00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:41.130
that all 12 people

189
00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:44.055
really thought this was guilt
beyond a reasonable doubt,

190
00:09:44.055 --> 00:09:48.340
or maybe there's some of
this free riding going on here?

191
00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:50.690
Some people are just
voting guilty thinking,

192
00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:54.590
"Well, if everyone
else thinks guilty,

193
00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:55.820
well, then I'm going
to think guilty too.

194
00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:57.425
So I'll vote guilty

195
00:09:57.425 --> 00:09:59.690
even when I really ought
to vote not guilty."

196
00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:03.590
So that's, of course,
different context,

197
00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:05.850
but it helps us think
about this idea

198
00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:11.220
of banking on the wisdom
of crowds in this context.

199
00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:15.065
So for sure, it's

200
00:10:15.065 --> 00:10:17.810
a comfort when I'm

201
00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:20.690
thinking about putting
$2,000 in that well,

202
00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:24.620
as you know, I only actually
make the investment

203
00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:30.650
if other people have also
pick this investment.

204
00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:35.405
But if I am just

205
00:10:35.405 --> 00:10:41.405
free riding here on
other people's information,

206
00:10:41.405 --> 00:10:44.645
then how do we know they're
not doing the same thing?

207
00:10:44.645 --> 00:10:48.080
How do I know that there's
really no one here who

208
00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:51.230
has too much of
information about this,

209
00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:52.460
and everyone's just
hoping someone

210
00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:54.110
else knows more than they do?

211
00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:58.630
Maybe we're all crowdfunding.

212
00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:00.710
The wisdom of crowds
makes the most sense

213
00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:02.600
when different people
know different things.

214
00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:04.580
You're bringing different bits
of information to

215
00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:07.205
bear on whether it's a good idea.

216
00:11:07.205 --> 00:11:09.560
Well, maybe there are

217
00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:12.755
situations where
that's really true.

218
00:11:12.755 --> 00:11:15.220
Maybe there's other situations
where, basically,

219
00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:18.230
it's really we all
know the same thing,

220
00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:19.550
which isn't very much.

221
00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:21.860
So everyone doing the same thing

222
00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:22.940
doesn't really mean that much.

223
00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:24.500
They're not investing
for different reasons.

224
00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:27.620
We're all investing for
the same sketchy reason.

225
00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:32.810
So there's no more information
in 1,000 people investing

226
00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:34.430
that way than
one person because it's

227
00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:37.970
all the same scrap of information
that we are banking on.

228
00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:43.090
So just to summarize this point,

229
00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:48.860
you do have some
of this wisdom of

230
00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:53.150
crowds going for you in
the crowdfunding context.

231
00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:54.830
But I think you
want to think about

232
00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:58.220
a little bit about
whether it's realistic in

233
00:11:58.220 --> 00:11:59.930
a situation you're looking at

234
00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:02.480
that the fact that
other people are

235
00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:04.460
investing is telling you

236
00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:07.250
things that you
don't already know,

237
00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:10.099
or could it instead
be a situation

238
00:12:10.099 --> 00:12:13.385
where everyone is hoping that
somebody knows something,

239
00:12:13.385 --> 00:12:15.530
and they think there's a wisdom

240
00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:17.330
of crowds and crossing
a threshold when,

241
00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:19.980
in fact, there isn't.
