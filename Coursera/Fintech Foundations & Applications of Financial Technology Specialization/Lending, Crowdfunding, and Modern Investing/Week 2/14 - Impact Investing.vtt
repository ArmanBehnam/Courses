1
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.185
Okay. Well, given what we have

2
00:00:07.185 --> 00:00:10.980
discussed about the prospects for

3
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.690
a crowdfunding investment to be

4
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.570
a positive expected
return investment

5
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.460
and how there is
challenges there,

6
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.020
maybe not prohibitive challenges,

7
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.820
but there certainly
are challenges,

8
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.820
it's possible that
a better way to look

9
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.345
at crowdfunding is that
when people invest,

10
00:00:27.345 --> 00:00:31.120
it's not just about
the expected return.

11
00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.900
It's not all about what's
the expected profit here,

12
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.180
and am I making money

13
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.960
here relative to just
putting in the market?

14
00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.180
If you think about it, it doesn't

15
00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.960
have to be just all
about the money.

16
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.460
If I'm investing in
a crowdfunding site,

17
00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.470
maybe I see someone's trying
to do something I think,

18
00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.035
"Okay, I like what you're
trying to do that,

19
00:01:00.035 --> 00:01:02.830
I'm going to I'm going to
help you try to do that."

20
00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.760
Or "I'll give you some money,

21
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.520
I'd love to get it back.

22
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.400
I'd love to get
a return, but really,

23
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.290
I just liked that you're
trying to make a go with that,

24
00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.700
and I'll throw something

25
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.220
your way to see if see
if I can be helpful."

26
00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.500
So I could be doing that.

27
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.070
Also, my goals here could be

28
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.570
in the social impact
of this startup.

29
00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.540
So I see the start-up
and I like what

30
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.720
I think your company
can do for society.

31
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.940
That it's going to throw off

32
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.225
benefits for society
from my point of view,

33
00:01:41.225 --> 00:01:46.625
and I like the idea of
making that happen.

34
00:01:46.625 --> 00:01:50.960
So I'd like the idea
that this is a company

35
00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.290
that they got a goal

36
00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.350
of making money and making
money will be good,

37
00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:58.670
but making money in

38
00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.020
some sense is a virtue of
them becoming profitable.

39
00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.190
Is that this means
they can become

40
00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.565
a self-sustaining company
that's throwing off as impact,

41
00:02:07.565 --> 00:02:10.235
get them to the point
where their cash flows

42
00:02:10.235 --> 00:02:14.105
allow them to operate
in perpetuity,

43
00:02:14.105 --> 00:02:17.000
and then they will
they will generate

44
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.235
this social benefit that
I see as the big virtue.

45
00:02:22.235 --> 00:02:26.055
So this has become
actually a big part

46
00:02:26.055 --> 00:02:30.690
of investing in this country
and around the world.

47
00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.670
People call it impact investing.

48
00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.070
The actual phrase
impact investing

49
00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.215
only goes back about
a dozen years.

50
00:02:42.215 --> 00:02:44.540
The concept goes back maybe
a little further than that,

51
00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.790
but the idea of
impact investing is.

52
00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:55.949
So I'm investing dollars
and I want to get a return,

53
00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.735
but I also have

54
00:02:59.735 --> 00:03:02.570
some other goal in mind
and I'm investing in

55
00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:07.550
companies that I have explicitly
stated as their purpose.

56
00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.080
That they are interested not

57
00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.775
only in the financial return,

58
00:03:10.775 --> 00:03:15.335
but also in this other goal,

59
00:03:15.335 --> 00:03:18.010
that they view as
a social benefit.

60
00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.700
So if I like what they are

61
00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.770
pushing as a social benefit,
then I say, "Okay,

62
00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:23.720
I'm going to invest
with you and not

63
00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.090
just be looking for dollars,

64
00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.835
but also be looking for
that social impact."

65
00:03:28.835 --> 00:03:31.940
So if you look around
the economy these days,

66
00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.745
you see this impact
investing playing out

67
00:03:34.745 --> 00:03:37.880
in the public capital markets
where I might invest in

68
00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.240
a company because I
like what they do or I

69
00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.710
might invest in a company because

70
00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:44.900
I don't like what they do,

71
00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.710
but I'm going to use
my votes with the shares,

72
00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:49.910
and I'm going to use my vote.

73
00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.340
So I'm going to use
my other influence as

74
00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.920
an investor to push the company

75
00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.035
in the direction that I think is

76
00:03:57.035 --> 00:04:00.200
this more socially beneficial
direction for them to go.

77
00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.870
So you get that in
the public capital markets,

78
00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:08.180
but you also get that in
the startup market too.

79
00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.675
So these days, you have

80
00:04:11.675 --> 00:04:15.530
venture capital funds that
are all about impact.

81
00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.590
Everything they do, they are
looking for companies that,

82
00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.055
yes, have have profit potential.

83
00:04:22.055 --> 00:04:23.690
They definitely want

84
00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.840
the company to become
self-sustaining,

85
00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.855
but they also have this
social benefit goal in mind,

86
00:04:31.855 --> 00:04:37.365
and that's a big part of
why they're investing.

87
00:04:37.365 --> 00:04:40.150
So it could be accompany

88
00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.435
where the product
itself is the impact.

89
00:04:45.435 --> 00:04:49.250
So they're producing a new kind

90
00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.750
of stove to use in
developing worlds that don't

91
00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:58.130
pollute so much or maybe

92
00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:02.130
they're producing
a regular commodity product

93
00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:03.150
like coffee beans,

94
00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.480
but the way they
source the coffee,

95
00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:09.395
the way they pay for the people
picking the coffee beans

96
00:05:09.395 --> 00:05:14.690
is trying to ensure that
they get a decent wage.

97
00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:15.760
So it could be the project,

98
00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.260
it could be the process,
but whatever it is,

99
00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.900
they've got a social impact
that they are angling for,

100
00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.520
and that's part of
why you're investing.

101
00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:33.590
Not only could that
be part of what's

102
00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:36.095
going on in the
crowdfunding world.

103
00:05:36.095 --> 00:05:37.880
In fact, if you look at

104
00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:42.730
the websites of
the crowdfunding portals,

105
00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:44.255
you'll see that they really

106
00:05:44.255 --> 00:05:47.900
specifically articulate
this kind of

107
00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:54.920
goal as something they see
as a virtual crowdfunding.

108
00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.900
So here's a quote. I'm just
going to read you a quote.

109
00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.345
I got this off the
Wefunder website.

110
00:05:59.345 --> 00:06:02.585
This is on the website
as of just yesterday.

111
00:06:02.585 --> 00:06:04.640
It says that, "Our
opinion is that

112
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.540
investing should not be solely
about earning a return.

113
00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:10.030
To invest in something
as risky as a startup,

114
00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:11.510
you should feel something

115
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:14.515
extra beyond
just the business model.

116
00:06:14.515 --> 00:06:16.100
For us, that something extra is

117
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.560
the personal fulfillment
we get from helping

118
00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.300
a founder take their shot at

119
00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.550
making our world a
slightly better place.

120
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:24.830
We also think it's pretty
cool to learn about

121
00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:26.030
different industries when we

122
00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:27.420
get updates from the founder."

123
00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:28.475
So they're adding their,

124
00:06:28.475 --> 00:06:30.890
not just the impact
investing idea

125
00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:32.170
and giving someone their shot,

126
00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:34.760
but also once you
invest in a company,

127
00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:39.095
you can just have a window
onto being an entrepreneur.

128
00:06:39.095 --> 00:06:42.030
You might want to be
an entrepreneur yourself.

129
00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:44.895
Maybe you want to quit
the day job and do that,

130
00:06:44.895 --> 00:06:46.410
but before you do that,

131
00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:51.000
why not follow some companies
from the ground up.

132
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.520
Hopefully they go up from

133
00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.130
the ground and you
will get the updates,

134
00:06:55.130 --> 00:07:00.680
you will hear from the founder
and see what happens,

135
00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:05.020
and maybe that would guide
you on your own journey.

136
00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:07.310
So just a couple of thoughts

137
00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:10.234
about if you want to
be an impact investor,

138
00:07:10.234 --> 00:07:14.030
there are a couple
guides that you can use

139
00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:16.610
to help you direct

140
00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:20.270
your money to such companies
if that is your goal.

141
00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:23.330
There's two
designations a company

142
00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:25.640
can have that you can look for,

143
00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:28.670
that I would look for
as an impact investor.

144
00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:31.290
One question to ask is,

145
00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:35.970
is this company a
B Corp? What's a B Corp?

146
00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:39.590
A B Corp is a corporation
that has been

147
00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:43.640
designated a B Corp by
a private outfit called B Lab,

148
00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:46.685
and B Lab is all about
impact investing.

149
00:07:46.685 --> 00:07:50.790
A company applies to
B Lab to be a B Corp,

150
00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:54.485
an then B Lab studies
all their practices,

151
00:07:54.485 --> 00:08:02.870
how they pay their workers,
do they pollute?

152
00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:05.825
What's their corporate
governance structure?

153
00:08:05.825 --> 00:08:08.765
All the different things you
might be thinking about.

154
00:08:08.765 --> 00:08:13.070
If you score high enough
on their scorecard,

155
00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:14.750
then you're a B Corp.

156
00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:16.490
There's thousands of B Corps now.

157
00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:20.690
If you look on
the crowdfunding websites,

158
00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:22.640
you'll see plenty of
companies will proudly say,

159
00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:24.935
"We are a B Corp." So that's
one thing to look for.

160
00:08:24.935 --> 00:08:27.170
Not just that they've
been vetted by B Lab,

161
00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:30.690
but B Lab follows up.

162
00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:34.965
You tell them how to judge,

163
00:08:34.965 --> 00:08:38.889
how to measure your impact

164
00:08:38.889 --> 00:08:41.420
against a benchmark
and they do that,

165
00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:45.800
and they will drop you if
you don't come through.

166
00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.300
So besides B Corp,

167
00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:49.605
you also have benefit corps.

168
00:08:49.605 --> 00:08:55.935
A benefit corp, that's
actually a legal designation.

169
00:08:55.935 --> 00:08:59.190
You register as a benefit corp

170
00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:01.470
with the state when
you incorporate.

171
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:05.480
What it means to register as
a benefit corp is that you

172
00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:10.880
articulate what exactly
your impact goal is.

173
00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:13.040
Most states will also make

174
00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:16.340
you not just
articulate what it is,

175
00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:18.605
but also spell out

176
00:09:18.605 --> 00:09:21.770
how your progress against
that goal can be measured.

177
00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:25.160
They will also make you designate

178
00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.680
a director on your board

179
00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:30.365
to be in charge of
that impact goal,

180
00:09:30.365 --> 00:09:34.010
and you're also going to be
liable to your investors.

181
00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:36.140
Investors could even sue you over

182
00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:38.990
not pursuing your impact goals.

183
00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:42.335
So they've made
a real legal commitment

184
00:09:42.335 --> 00:09:46.350
to pursuing their impact goal.

185
00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:49.870
As opposed to
just a B Corp that has

186
00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:52.310
got a stamp of approval
from a private outfit,

187
00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:56.840
a benefit corp has actually
legally exposed themselves

188
00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:58.925
to damages if they

189
00:09:58.925 --> 00:10:01.940
don't follow through
on their impact goal.

190
00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:03.565
So those are two things
to look for,

191
00:10:03.565 --> 00:10:06.245
B Corps and then
also benefit corps.

192
00:10:06.245 --> 00:10:09.920
So just to summarize this piece.

193
00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:17.190
So crowdfunding, it can be
hard to justify sometimes.

194
00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:18.440
Crowdfunding investment is

195
00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:20.735
just a purely
financial basis that,

196
00:10:20.735 --> 00:10:22.400
"Yeah, I put in 2,000 bucks in,

197
00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:27.275
but my expected return is enough

198
00:10:27.275 --> 00:10:28.895
more than 2,000 bucks to

199
00:10:28.895 --> 00:10:32.420
justify the expense of
making the investment."

200
00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:36.965
Yeah, maybe, but it can
be hard story to tell.

201
00:10:36.965 --> 00:10:40.145
Maybe it's better
to look at it as,

202
00:10:40.145 --> 00:10:44.915
"I'm getting
some enjoyment here out

203
00:10:44.915 --> 00:10:48.170
of helping someone start

204
00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:49.975
a company that I
think is a neat idea.

205
00:10:49.975 --> 00:10:53.985
I'm also getting some utility

206
00:10:53.985 --> 00:10:58.610
out of the social impact that
I see the company have."

207
00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:02.345
Wefunder tosses in
this third idea that,

208
00:11:02.345 --> 00:11:05.660
"I'm learning about being

209
00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:08.060
an entrepreneur by following

210
00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:10.755
this investment
once I'm involved."

211
00:11:10.755 --> 00:11:12.840
When you put
those things together,

212
00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:17.240
maybe that helps us
explain why some people

213
00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:19.400
put money into
crowdfunding when just

214
00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:21.680
from a pure financial
point of view,

215
00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:25.200
it could be a hard thing
to pencil out.
