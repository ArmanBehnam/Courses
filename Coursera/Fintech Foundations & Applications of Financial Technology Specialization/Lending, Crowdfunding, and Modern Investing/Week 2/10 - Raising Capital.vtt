00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:06.405
For anyone investing today,

2
00:00:06.405 --> 00:00:09.150
crowdfunding is
a big change from how

3
00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.075
companies have traditionally
tapped the retail markets.

4
00:00:12.075 --> 00:00:15.510
Okay? But for an investor

5
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.440
who was investing
a 100 years ago,

6
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.300
who somehow got a peek at
what we're doing today,

7
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.320
some elements of it wouldn't
look so surprising.

8
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.860
Okay? So, the internet
would surprise them.

9
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:34.380
Okay that's true, but
companies going directly to

10
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.350
the retail market with
advertisements and

11
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.605
with in cautious language,

12
00:00:40.605 --> 00:00:44.120
and celebrity endorsements, and

13
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.940
then just taking whatever money

14
00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.250
they could raise that way, well,

15
00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.940
this was pretty much
standard operating procedure

16
00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.540
if you go back more
than a 100 years,

17
00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:02.480
until it's an accumulation
of bad experiences and

18
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.870
a fraud here and there

19
00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:09.290
started the regulatory
process at the state,

20
00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:14.030
and then the federal
level that has given us

21
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.525
the protocol that we

22
00:01:17.525 --> 00:01:20.710
follow now for tapping
the capital markets.

23
00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.660
When I think about how we go to

24
00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.910
the capital markets today and how

25
00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.340
crowdfunding compares to that,

26
00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.315
there's an English writer

27
00:01:34.315 --> 00:01:37.400
also from about a 100 years ago,

28
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.140
one thing he said back
I think it was 1929,

29
00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.080
he said and I paraphrase here,

30
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.480
before you tear a fence down,

31
00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.540
make sure you know why it was
there in the first place.

32
00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.620
All right. Before you
tear a fence down,

33
00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.025
make sure you know why it was
there in the first place.

34
00:01:59.025 --> 00:02:04.345
Right? So, crowdfunding is
tearing the fences down around

35
00:02:04.345 --> 00:02:10.115
going to the retail public
and raising money,

36
00:02:10.115 --> 00:02:12.065
and I see in some ways,

37
00:02:12.065 --> 00:02:16.640
bringing us back to where
we were a long time ago.

38
00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.600
Not in every way and it's
careful in some ways

39
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.130
but there's a sense in

40
00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.590
which that's what's
going on. All right.

41
00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.430
So, if we want to understand
what crowdfunding is,

42
00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.600
how to think about
this new regulatory environment,

43
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.395
these new loosening of

44
00:02:36.395 --> 00:02:38.240
regulations on
tapping this market,

45
00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.095
it's worth first
seeing what it is,

46
00:02:42.095 --> 00:02:43.970
what it is we're doing now in

47
00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.150
the existing
regulatory environment

48
00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.880
to facilitate raising money
from the retail public.

49
00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.030
Okay. So let's think about
the traditional IPO,

50
00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.250
Initial Public Offering IPO.

51
00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.700
So, let's say you're

52
00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.880
an entrepreneur and you've
been very successful.

53
00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.600
You're so successful that

54
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.610
you're thinking now
it's time to go public.

55
00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.150
Okay? Now I'm ready
to go out there and

56
00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.130
sell a piece of my company
to the retail investor.

57
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:19.440
Okay? So how do I do this?

58
00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.560
Well, the first thing I do is

59
00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.035
I'm going to engage
an underwriter.

60
00:03:24.035 --> 00:03:26.120
Okay? An underwriter. Now,
an underwriter is going to

61
00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.490
be big investment bank.

62
00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:29.870
I think Goldman Sachs,

63
00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.550
that kind of bank.

64
00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:34.040
I'm going to have
probably little contest

65
00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.330
among investment banks.

66
00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:36.650
We call it a bake off.

67
00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.660
Right? Like someone's going

68
00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.430
to try to come up
with the best muffin.

69
00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:41.630
Right? That's what they did.

70
00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.890
They call it a bake off in
the investment banking world,

71
00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.410
where the different banks
come to me and

72
00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.200
pitch to me how they're going
to take my company public.

73
00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.550
How they think about my company,

74
00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:55.895
think about the
valuation and so on.

75
00:03:55.895 --> 00:03:57.410
They pitch to me.

76
00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.765
I pick one of them
and say, "Okay.

77
00:03:59.765 --> 00:04:01.430
It's going to be you and me.

78
00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.860
We're going to take
my company public. "

79
00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.695
Notice by the way here
that so now I'm engaging

80
00:04:06.695 --> 00:04:11.565
a bank that goes to
the market all the time.

81
00:04:11.565 --> 00:04:13.140
Right? If I engage Goldman.

82
00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.450
Well, Goldman Sachs
does a lot of IPOs.

83
00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.975
They've been doing IPOs all year.

84
00:04:17.975 --> 00:04:20.360
They've got a reputation

85
00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.970
with the capital markets
that I don't.

86
00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:24.635
I'm just a start-up.

87
00:04:24.635 --> 00:04:28.224
They haven't yet
heard of me probably

88
00:04:28.224 --> 00:04:34.785
but they will and when
they hear about me,

89
00:04:34.785 --> 00:04:36.260
it's not just me, it's also

90
00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.710
Goldman Sachs or whoever
the bank is that I choose,

91
00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:46.730
are sticking their neck
out for my reputation.

92
00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.250
Right? So, we choose a bank with

93
00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.615
a long track record of doing
IPOs and then what happens?

94
00:04:53.615 --> 00:04:57.935
Okay. Now, we start the process
with the regulators.

95
00:04:57.935 --> 00:05:01.730
Okay? So now, together
with the investment bank,

96
00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:06.800
we're going to work up a draft
registration statement.

97
00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.430
So, it's something like
a prospectus for an offering,

98
00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.380
but it's a draft
and we send it to

99
00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.630
the Securities and
Exchange Commission,

100
00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.085
and they get the draft,

101
00:05:16.085 --> 00:05:18.590
and they read it
every word by word,

102
00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:22.070
and they send us back
a letter which is going

103
00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:25.715
to have bullet points that
are going to go on for pages,

104
00:05:25.715 --> 00:05:28.010
50, 60, 70, 80,

105
00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:32.195
bullet points about
you say this here,

106
00:05:32.195 --> 00:05:34.925
how do you know that, back it up,

107
00:05:34.925 --> 00:05:37.670
scale back, take it out,

108
00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:40.550
all these claims I want to make,

109
00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:43.430
they are holding
me to task saying,

110
00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:45.590
you back this up or
you take it out,

111
00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:46.880
or you scale it back,

112
00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.830
and I respond to all that.

113
00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:50.180
So I see all these bullet points.

114
00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.435
I send a new one,
they look at that.

115
00:05:53.435 --> 00:05:55.130
More bullet points
back and forth,

116
00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:57.350
could happen four or
five times. All right.

117
00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:00.125
So, the document that

118
00:06:00.125 --> 00:06:03.470
is ultimately going to be
presented to the public

119
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:08.435
has gone through
this very detailed scrutiny

120
00:06:08.435 --> 00:06:09.590
by the regulators.

121
00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:11.285
Okay? So then finally,

122
00:06:11.285 --> 00:06:14.270
I submit that document
and that's going to

123
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:17.160
be for the world to see.

124
00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.209
It's posted on the website

125
00:06:20.209 --> 00:06:22.255
of the Securities
Exchange Commission.

126
00:06:22.255 --> 00:06:25.520
Okay? So I post that document and

127
00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.970
then we choose a price range.

128
00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:30.500
We haven't quite
chosen a price yet,

129
00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.560
which is a price range
could say we were thinking,

130
00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.440
$14 to $16 and

131
00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:37.610
maybe give us a sense of

132
00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:38.960
how many shares
we're talking about.

133
00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.960
I think maybe a 100 million
shares, $14 to $16.

134
00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.465
So, we make that announcement and

135
00:06:44.465 --> 00:06:47.835
then we go on the road show.

136
00:06:47.835 --> 00:06:50.069
Okay? So now there's
a two week period

137
00:06:50.069 --> 00:06:53.340
where the executives
of my company,

138
00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:55.620
me and my lieutenants,

139
00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:00.120
and also the investment bank,
and they're professionals,

140
00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.470
and other people who are all

141
00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:05.535
traveling around the country,

142
00:07:05.535 --> 00:07:08.300
and we're going to go to
other countries too meeting

143
00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:12.380
with the big
institutional investors,

144
00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:14.870
where we are pitching

145
00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:18.140
our story and defending

146
00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:21.115
the price range
that we announced,

147
00:07:21.115 --> 00:07:23.480
and they are going
to bicker with us.

148
00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:25.250
We say what do you mean 14 to 16,

149
00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:29.030
and they'll have
their own discussion of how

150
00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:30.410
that price compares to

151
00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:33.275
the price other stocks
are already trading at.

152
00:07:33.275 --> 00:07:35.870
We're going to have
a lot of back and forth.

153
00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:38.870
At the end of every meeting
with the investors,

154
00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:43.320
they're going to express
their interest in the offering,

155
00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:45.400
and when they express
their interest,

156
00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.810
we're going to write
that down in a book.

157
00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:49.100
It's called book building.

158
00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:50.660
This is called a
book-building process

159
00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:52.415
because at the end of every day,

160
00:07:52.415 --> 00:07:55.400
at the end of every pitch
you're going to say,

161
00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:57.230
you want shares or
don't want shares.

162
00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:58.865
How many shares? What price?

163
00:07:58.865 --> 00:08:00.200
I write it down,

164
00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:01.780
and the book just builds,

165
00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:04.190
and I hope to have
a lot more orders in

166
00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:06.785
the book than I actually
have shares to sell.

167
00:08:06.785 --> 00:08:08.570
I would keep doing
this, keep going,

168
00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:11.390
keep on like two weeks of
this and then finally,

169
00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:13.100
at the end of all that,

170
00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:15.200
at the close of
trading on some day,

171
00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:16.390
we say that's it,

172
00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:18.870
we are going to
price the offering

173
00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:22.140
and the price doesn't have
to be in that initial range,

174
00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:24.960
it's going to be
somewhere around there.

175
00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:28.610
We choose the price and we place

176
00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:31.610
the shares with
investors at that price,

177
00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:34.055
and then the next day
it starts trading.

178
00:08:34.055 --> 00:08:36.470
Now one thing to
notice here if you're

179
00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:40.070
a retail investor and you
see a company going public,

180
00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:41.420
you see right now

181
00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:44.060
the big talk as I'm
sitting here is LYFT,

182
00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:46.145
the ride share service.

183
00:08:46.145 --> 00:08:48.350
You're looking
that, "I love LYFT,

184
00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:50.570
I want shares in the IPO,

185
00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:51.590
I think this is going great.

186
00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:55.520
Well, you probably won't get
shares. You probably won't.

187
00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:58.730
The interaction on the road

188
00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:00.290
is all with
institutional investors,

189
00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:01.865
that's where they're focusing on.

190
00:09:01.865 --> 00:09:04.040
If you have a brokerage account,
you tell your broker,

191
00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:06.575
"Hey, get me some shares
in that LYFT IPO."

192
00:09:06.575 --> 00:09:07.940
He might say, "Well, okay.

193
00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:10.070
I'll see what I can do," alright.

194
00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:13.880
Probably he'll come
back and say, "No, no.

195
00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:15.920
You're not going to get
shares in the IPO."

196
00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:21.560
If you are huge customer of
that brokerage, then yeah,

197
00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:23.840
maybe if you've given a lot
business, he'll say, "Okay,

198
00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.070
this is your lucky day, I'll give

199
00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:27.410
you 200 shares,"
something like that.

200
00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:29.645
But mostly what they're
going to say is,

201
00:09:29.645 --> 00:09:32.840
"Just wait till it
starts trading.

202
00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:34.520
You don't have to get them now,

203
00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:37.685
you can get them when
they start trading."

204
00:09:37.685 --> 00:09:40.175
So you can do that,

205
00:09:40.175 --> 00:09:42.590
but let me just say a couple
of things about that.

206
00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:47.614
Number one, when you
see a company go IPO

207
00:09:47.614 --> 00:09:50.600
that offer price that they choose

208
00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:55.280
tends to be a very juicy bargain.

209
00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:59.540
On average, across all IPOs

210
00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:01.370
going all the way
back to the 60s.

211
00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:03.710
If you look at every IPO

212
00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:05.750
and you do a little
thought experiment,

213
00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:07.820
what if I invested at

214
00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:11.675
every IPO at that offer
price they chose,

215
00:10:11.675 --> 00:10:15.020
and then just held
it to the next day.

216
00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:16.865
The first day it starts trading,

217
00:10:16.865 --> 00:10:18.590
I just sell those shares I got.

218
00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:21.095
This is just thought experiment.

219
00:10:21.095 --> 00:10:23.780
If you look at what you
would have made would be

220
00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:26.960
on average in one day 18 percent,

221
00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:29.630
the one day you
return 18 percent.

222
00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:31.940
That's an average
across the IPOs,

223
00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:33.275
so you might look
at that and say,

224
00:10:33.275 --> 00:10:35.105
"Oh my God, that's great.

225
00:10:35.105 --> 00:10:38.630
It's hard to make five percent
in today's world,

226
00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:40.625
this is 18 percent in one day."

227
00:10:40.625 --> 00:10:42.590
But in fact, your broker

228
00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:44.420
is not going to give
you the shares.

229
00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:46.850
When he does give you
the shares, if he ever does,

230
00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:48.275
if you're not a big
customer but he said,

231
00:10:48.275 --> 00:10:49.940
"I can get you the IPO shares,

232
00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:51.395
this is your lucky day.

233
00:10:51.395 --> 00:10:52.880
I can get you the shares."

234
00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:54.620
Not only that they're
a big bargain

235
00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:57.365
because remember they
said 14 to 16 bucks?

236
00:10:57.365 --> 00:10:59.180
Well, they're pricing
it at 12, right?

237
00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:00.740
They've discounted it, and

238
00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:02.345
I can get you shares
at that disk,

239
00:11:02.345 --> 00:11:04.955
I can get you price shares at 12.

240
00:11:04.955 --> 00:11:07.310
Well, in that case that

241
00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:09.860
one is probably not
going up 18 percent,

242
00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:12.500
that is the big red flag.

243
00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:13.985
In fact in IPO world,

244
00:11:13.985 --> 00:11:15.650
if they price it down

245
00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:17.090
from the initial
price range they said

246
00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:18.470
14 to 16 but on

247
00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:20.690
the big day they decide
to price it at 12.

248
00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:24.725
That's not going up 18 per
cent probably on average,

249
00:11:24.725 --> 00:11:26.540
that means it's
probably going to go

250
00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:28.430
nowhere in the first day.

251
00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:30.155
It's the ones they price up

252
00:11:30.155 --> 00:11:32.795
actually are the ones
that really do great.

253
00:11:32.795 --> 00:11:36.245
So you're not going to get
it as a retail investor,

254
00:11:36.245 --> 00:11:39.380
as a retail investor
you're not going to

255
00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:42.470
get it on at IPO price.

256
00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:47.330
You can buy it in the aftermarket
when it starts trading.

257
00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:50.690
But actually, that tends

258
00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:53.645
to be not a bargain
really at all.

259
00:11:53.645 --> 00:11:56.630
In fact, it's
well-established that on

260
00:11:56.630 --> 00:12:00.500
average if you look at stocks
that have gone public,

261
00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:02.930
if you buy them on
the aftermarket where they're

262
00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:05.870
trading on average over
the next couple of years,

263
00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:07.880
there average return is

264
00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:10.770
actually kind of
below the market.

265
00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:14.270
IPO sort of under-perform once

266
00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:16.730
they start trading for
a couple of years.

267
00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:20.240
So it's not really that exciting

268
00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:23.600
to get in on the IPO
in the aftermarket.

269
00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:25.040
But of course you could

270
00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:27.260
buy a stock that
goes to the moon.

271
00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.330
If you bought Google or

272
00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:31.775
Facebook or whatever
after their IPO,

273
00:12:31.775 --> 00:12:34.310
that would be terrific if
you held onto those shares.

274
00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:36.440
So obviously,

275
00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:40.970
in any point you can buy
a winner stock but it's really

276
00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:44.150
getting in at the IPO price
that is so attractive and as

277
00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:48.780
a retail investor that's
not going to happen.

278
00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:54.320
So that's just a sketch there
of how we go public, right.

279
00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:58.970
There's a lot of
regulatory scrutiny with

280
00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:04.250
all the documents that you
are presenting to the public.

281
00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:07.220
You're engaging
an underwriter who has

282
00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:11.330
tremendous experience
and reputation

283
00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:13.475
with the capital markets.

284
00:13:13.475 --> 00:13:16.130
So that's what it's like
for the its point of view,

285
00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:17.600
from the retail
investors point of

286
00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:20.060
view IPOs are fun to watch,

287
00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:23.030
but it's not really
something that you're

288
00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:26.090
going to participate in and
you can buy like anyone else,

289
00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:28.190
you can buy it once
it starts trading.

290
00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:29.780
So bear that in mind.

291
00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:31.700
Here's one other
interesting fact,

292
00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:38.900
which is that the number
of IPOs is way down.

293
00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:41.750
So what I mean by that is,

294
00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:44.630
when I started teaching

295
00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:47.540
here at the Wharton School
since the mid 90s.

296
00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:49.100
I've been here since the mid 90s,

297
00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:53.105
the mid 90s number of

298
00:13:53.105 --> 00:13:58.805
publicly listed companies
was over seven thousand,

299
00:13:58.805 --> 00:14:05.510
that's like 7200 publicly
listed companies in the US.

300
00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:07.550
That had been going
up and up and up

301
00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:09.290
and it seemed as natural.

302
00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:11.150
Well, of course it's just
going to keep going up

303
00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:14.450
as the US population grows.

304
00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:16.490
Naturally, you
think the number of

305
00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:18.920
publicly listed
companies would grow.

306
00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:22.850
So the number of
publicly listed companies is

307
00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:27.995
today half of what it
was about 25 years ago,

308
00:14:27.995 --> 00:14:32.240
so you think from
the retail investors' point

309
00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:36.545
of view just the scope of choice.

310
00:14:36.545 --> 00:14:38.405
Where am I going to put my money?

311
00:14:38.405 --> 00:14:40.910
What are the opportunities
out there for

312
00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:44.435
me to take a view

313
00:14:44.435 --> 00:14:46.535
on some stocked to get in on

314
00:14:46.535 --> 00:14:50.450
a ground floor to make
an exciting investment?

315
00:14:50.450 --> 00:14:53.600
Well, it's half as many
stocks as they were,

316
00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:56.060
and I think about
why that might be.

317
00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:58.040
Well, of course it's easier for

318
00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:00.845
companies to stay
private these days.

319
00:15:00.845 --> 00:15:03.710
Think about Uber, I said LYFT.

320
00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:08.450
LYFT is gone public while
Uber isn't and hasn't,

321
00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:10.520
and they've been private for

322
00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:11.750
a long time you could
think of a lot of

323
00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:13.760
other companies like
them staying private.

324
00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:15.320
You have a lot of companies also

325
00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:17.750
that maybe was never

326
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:19.640
even their goal to
go public these days

327
00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:22.730
that their goal is just to get

328
00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:26.450
big enough maybe they'll
be a threat to Google,

329
00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:28.370
or Facebook, or Apple

330
00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:32.225
or some company like that and
then just sell out to them.

331
00:15:32.225 --> 00:15:35.270
So by the time they're
ready to sell,

332
00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:36.380
well they sell out to a big

333
00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:37.790
company and you never even got

334
00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:41.555
your chance because they just
sell out to public company,

335
00:15:41.555 --> 00:15:45.330
that's for average they're
going to be a very small part.

336
00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:49.310
Sort of the investment
opportunity set

337
00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:53.150
has shrunk over the years,

338
00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:59.450
and this has made life
more difficult for

339
00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:02.960
the retail investor to put
their money to work in a way

340
00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:04.790
that they find interesting

341
00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:07.175
or promising or that they enjoy.

342
00:16:07.175 --> 00:16:10.775
So just to summarize
what we've said here,

343
00:16:10.775 --> 00:16:14.660
the status quo of

344
00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:16.535
raising money from
the capital markets when you

345
00:16:16.535 --> 00:16:18.665
go to the retail, public,

346
00:16:18.665 --> 00:16:21.230
I do that through
the IPO process in which

347
00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:26.690
the retail public really
barely plays any role at all.

348
00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:32.690
I do this through
tight scrutiny by

349
00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:36.335
the regulators through engaging

350
