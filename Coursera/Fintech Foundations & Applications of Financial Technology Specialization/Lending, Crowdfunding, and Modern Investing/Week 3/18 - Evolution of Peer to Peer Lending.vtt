1
00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:07.740
All right. So what I
want to do now is talk

2
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.730
about the Evolution of
Peer to Peer Lending,

3
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.470
from its early days back in 2006,

4
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.065
to what we see now,

5
00:00:18.065 --> 00:00:19.645
and how it's really

6
00:00:19.645 --> 00:00:22.360
a business plan that's
really pivoted from

7
00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.385
one thing to another which is why

8
00:00:24.385 --> 00:00:26.915
as I mentioned,
the name is changing.

9
00:00:26.915 --> 00:00:29.665
Okay. So the original idea

10
00:00:29.665 --> 00:00:32.200
was peer-to-peer lending, right.

11
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.990
You have some people

12
00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:37.150
who have money that

13
00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.850
they want to just put
to work for a bit,

14
00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.320
and some people who are in

15
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.300
a situation where
they need to borrow,

16
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.100
let them find each other,

17
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.205
let them discover the terms
on which each side is happy,

18
00:00:50.205 --> 00:00:53.850
on the transaction
and the platform,

19
00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.790
the Internet platform
is just going

20
00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.065
to help them make
this happen, right.

21
00:00:58.065 --> 00:01:02.190
The big flat forms in those days
are the same as today.

22
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.730
The lenders to look for

23
00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:06.620
here if you want to
browse the Internet

24
00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.130
would be Lending Club,
and Prosper Marketplace.

25
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.180
I mean there are
plenty of others.

26
00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.350
I don't mean to say

27
00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:13.370
there are some how
better than others,

28
00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.155
but they've been there
since the beginning,

29
00:01:15.155 --> 00:01:18.980
and they have pivoted
along with the rest

30
00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:23.955
of this industry towards
marketplace lending.

31
00:01:23.955 --> 00:01:28.475
Okay. So you were
there to facilitate

32
00:01:28.475 --> 00:01:30.830
the discovery of
the borrowers and

33
00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.440
lenders with this sort of
idea was there all retail.

34
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.700
There's just all, just people

35
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.485
consumers living their lives,

36
00:01:36.485 --> 00:01:38.300
who either have money to put to

37
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.205
work or they need
some money right now.

38
00:01:40.205 --> 00:01:41.540
Okay. So how would this work?

39
00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.525
Well, you have borrowers,

40
00:01:45.525 --> 00:01:47.300
the borrowers if you wanted

41
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.320
to borrow in this marketplace,

42
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.340
you'd have to provide some
financial information,

43
00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.240
some standardized
financial information

44
00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.410
that they would need from you.

45
00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:55.820
So you would provide that,

46
00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.335
for people to look at.

47
00:01:57.335 --> 00:01:59.375
You could post a picture,

48
00:01:59.375 --> 00:02:01.760
and some people did of yourself,

49
00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.590
maybe you and your family.

50
00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.665
You would say well, here's
how much I want to borrow,

51
00:02:06.665 --> 00:02:10.045
and here is the most
I'm willing to pay.

52
00:02:10.045 --> 00:02:12.510
The term alone will
be pretty much fixed.

53
00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.890
It would just be a
mere on a three-year

54
00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.050
loan or five -year loan.

55
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.755
So that would be pretty
much standardized.

56
00:02:18.755 --> 00:02:21.110
Why would you go to this market?

57
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.705
Well, then and now

58
00:02:23.705 --> 00:02:25.850
the main reason people go to

59
00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.450
borrow in this market is
their credit card debt.

60
00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.010
All right. They've run up
a balance on their cards.

61
00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.080
They're paying
that big rate that,

62
00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.550
you'd see in the fine print,

63
00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:35.825
on your credit card statement,

64
00:02:35.825 --> 00:02:37.205
to pay in that big rate,

65
00:02:37.205 --> 00:02:39.260
and they want to

66
00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.120
refinance into something
more manageable.

67
00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.440
Okay. This is by 80 percent
of the borrowers.

68
00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.285
There some other reasons,
but that's the big one.

69
00:02:46.285 --> 00:02:50.075
Okay. They could get
the home equity line.

70
00:02:50.075 --> 00:02:51.575
They could go that route.

71
00:02:51.575 --> 00:02:53.720
Maybe some of them already have,

72
00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.630
and of course maybe
the others are thinking well,

73
00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.370
I don't want to risk
my house like that.

74
00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.275
I don't want to ramp up the risk

75
00:03:00.275 --> 00:03:02.675
of foreclosure
especially after we've

76
00:03:02.675 --> 00:03:04.730
seen that with our own eyes so

77
00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.960
much 10 years ago. So okay.

78
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.760
So they're trying to meet up

79
00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:11.810
each other and find the rate at

80
00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.550
which they're
willing to transact.

81
00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.715
Let me just sketch just
for a moment here,

82
00:03:17.715 --> 00:03:21.080
how as an economist would look
at this problem of trying

83
00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.530
to find the rate at
which we could transact.

84
00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.675
There's a fundamental
problem that

85
00:03:26.675 --> 00:03:30.705
lending institutions everywhere
encounter every day,

86
00:03:30.705 --> 00:03:32.970
and to an economist,

87
00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.000
the term of art for
this problem is

88
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.970
what they call credit rationing.

89
00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.135
The credit rationing.
Let me give you

90
00:03:39.135 --> 00:03:42.340
just without
any numbers or figures,

91
00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.930
just how to think about this
problem of credit rationing,

92
00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.770
and how it can be a barrier

93
00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:55.040
to finalizing transaction
on this marketplace.

94
00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.285
So here's the basic idea.

95
00:03:56.285 --> 00:03:58.355
Let's say we're thinking

96
00:03:58.355 --> 00:04:00.220
you maybe you're
going to loan to me.

97
00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.650
Okay. Maybe you're
going to loan to me.

98
00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.944
But the problem that
you're going to encounter,

99
00:04:05.944 --> 00:04:10.100
is that we both know that,

100
00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:14.245
I know things about my risk
that you don't know.

101
00:04:14.245 --> 00:04:19.050
All right. I know
things about my job,

102
00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:21.810
my health, my plans,

103
00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.220
all sorts of other things, my

104
00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:24.625
investments, whatever it is,

105
00:04:24.625 --> 00:04:27.875
I know things about my risk that

106
00:04:27.875 --> 00:04:29.600
would be difficult or maybe even

107
00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.760
impossible for you to
figure out for yourself.

108
00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.730
Okay. So the issue is that,

109
00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:37.640
if I let's say,

110
00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:44.415
I put a high probability on
the outcome where I go bust.

111
00:04:44.415 --> 00:04:46.525
All right. That I just
I can't pay it back,

112
00:04:46.525 --> 00:04:50.755
I privately know that
that's a high probability.

113
00:04:50.755 --> 00:04:52.830
You know it's possible right,

114
00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:53.970
but I happen to

115
00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.290
know that actually I put
high probability on that.

116
00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:00.035
Now, let's say you offer me,

117
00:05:00.035 --> 00:05:03.140
offer to loan to me at
a high interest rate.

118
00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:05.765
Well, if I look at that loan
at a high interest rate,

119
00:05:05.765 --> 00:05:08.060
I might look at that and
say, well, you know what,

120
00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.580
it's on paper it's
a high interest rate,

121
00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.220
but in fact if I put

122
00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:16.280
a high probability on
not repaying the loan,

123
00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:17.390
then it doesn't really
seem like such a

124
00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:18.470
high interest rate to me because

125
00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.890
I put a big probability on
paying you back zero, right.

126
00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:23.225
Or something small right.

127
00:05:23.225 --> 00:05:25.640
So a high interest
rate to me to someone

128
00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.760
who privately knows
his risk is high,

129
00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.890
might not seem so big,

130
00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:32.300
might not seem so onerous to me,

131
00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.180
because I see that big chance
of not paying you back.

132
00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.910
Whereas, someone who views,

133
00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:43.045
who privately knows
that he's low-risk,

134
00:05:43.045 --> 00:05:46.430
then puts a very high chance
on repaying the loan.

135
00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.140
So if it's a high
interest rate loan,

136
00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:50.075
that person looks at
is very expensive that

137
00:05:50.075 --> 00:05:52.160
I expect to repay this loan,

138
00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.550
and paying it back
whatever, 15-20 percent,

139
00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:57.100
whatever it is you said,

140
00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:00.810
to me that's expensive, right.

141
00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:03.020
So the issue is
that, if you loan,

142
00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:07.610
if you offer to loan to me
at a low interest rate,

143
00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:09.530
then I would accept that

144
00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:11.845
whether I'm low risk
or high risk.

145
00:06:11.845 --> 00:06:14.900
Okay. But the higher the
interest rate that you offer,

146
00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:17.730
the more likely it
is that the guy who

147
00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:19.520
privately knows he's low-risk

148
00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.305
is going to drop out
and say, forget it.

149
00:06:21.305 --> 00:06:22.940
But the guy who privately
knows that he's

150
00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:25.030
high risk is just still
going to accept it.

151
00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:28.220
As you increase the interest
rate that you offer,

152
00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:31.520
the average risk of the person

153
00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:34.995
who would accept
that offer, is going up.

154
00:06:34.995 --> 00:06:37.770
Okay. So whereas you might

155
00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:40.940
think that if we're trying
to find a rate to transact,

156
00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:42.305
there's got to be some,

157
00:06:42.305 --> 00:06:47.360
there's got to be some rate
that at which we can agree.

158
00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.475
The problem is that,

159
00:06:49.475 --> 00:06:51.260
you might only be willing to

160
00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:52.940
go so far with the interest rate

161
00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:54.290
that you offer because you know

162
00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:56.150
that if you go above that rate,

163
00:06:56.150 --> 00:07:00.590
then the effect of going

164
00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:01.820
above that rate on

165
00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:03.590
the expected risk of

166
00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:05.600
the person who would
accept that rate,

167
00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.250
is just too high.

168
00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:09.680
So you're willing
to go so far but

169
00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.210
not above that in the rate
that you'll offer me,

170
00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:13.580
and that's why people talk about

171
00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:15.170
credit rationing because normally

172
00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:16.955
in any market you think well,

173
00:07:16.955 --> 00:07:24.425
if there is excess demand to
buy something at some price,

174
00:07:24.425 --> 00:07:26.255
then the price is going to go

175
00:07:26.255 --> 00:07:29.045
up to make supply equal demand.

176
00:07:29.045 --> 00:07:30.680
But in the lending market,

177
00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:34.280
if there's excess demand
to lend at this rate,

178
00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:37.070
that doesn't mean that
the price is going to change.

179
00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:38.585
There's only so much.

180
00:07:38.585 --> 00:07:43.190
People are only going to
raise the rates so much.

181
00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:46.160
They're not going to go
higher than that because of

182
00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.290
this negative effect of the rate

183
00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:49.700
that you offer on

184
00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:53.015
the risk of the kind of
person who would accept it.

185
00:07:53.015 --> 00:07:54.380
So you get that kind of

186
00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:58.250
problem playing out
in this market,

187
00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:06.070
and it makes it hard to
transact efficiently.

188
00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:08.980
But people tried, that's
how this market started.

189
00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:10.765
So in the original days,

190
00:08:10.765 --> 00:08:12.820
if I want to borrow, I'd say,

191
00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:14.080
"I want to borrow this much

192
00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:15.580
at a rate no higher than this."

193
00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:17.380
Then the lenders
would say, " Well,

194
00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:19.390
I'm willing to loan whatever

195
00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:20.775
each one myself
along a 100 bucks,

196
00:08:20.775 --> 00:08:25.685
200 bucks, whatever and at
a rate no lower than this."

197
00:08:25.685 --> 00:08:28.490
So a bunch of people
making bids to lend

198
00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:31.940
and then you have
the borrower saying,

199
00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:33.080
"How much he wants to borrow?"

200
00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:36.920
If everyone who wants
to loan adds up to

201
00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:39.500
the amount that the
person wants to

202
00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:42.290
borrow, then that's it.

203
00:08:42.290 --> 00:08:44.660
You've got a transaction
and they set

204
00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:47.420
the interest rate at
the market clearing rate,

205
00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:48.560
and they say, "That's it, okay.

206
00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:49.610
You guys have a loan."

207
00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:51.500
So the lender supply the cash,

208
00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:52.760
the borrower gets the cash,

209
00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:54.290
and then the idea is to borrow,

210
00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:56.150
then ultimately
pays back the loan,

211
00:08:56.150 --> 00:09:00.455
and this is all intermediated
by the platform.

212
00:09:00.455 --> 00:09:02.150
Okay. So that's how it started,

213
00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:06.725
and there was some of
this in a small-scale.

214
00:09:06.725 --> 00:09:08.450
Of course, it didn't help very

215
00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:10.580
much that this started in 2006,

216
00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:11.870
and then very soon, well,

217
00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:15.484
we were in the recession
which naturally

218
00:09:15.484 --> 00:09:18.650
didn't help the
repayment capability

219
00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:20.630
of the people who borrowed.

220
00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:24.380
So what happened over
the next few years is that

221
00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:26.630
the lending platform
got more and more

222
00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:29.630
involved in the decisions.

223
00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:32.750
So they would start
the lending platform would make

224
00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:35.495
its own credit risk
evaluation and then set

225
00:09:35.495 --> 00:09:37.565
a floor on the interest rate

226
00:09:37.565 --> 00:09:40.230
for this particular borrower.

227
00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:43.550
After that, then
the lending platform would

228
00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:49.430
start not to putting a floor
on it but just say, "Okay,

229
00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:51.905
this guy we've looked
at the credit,

230
00:09:51.905 --> 00:09:54.015
we've looked at the financials
for this person,

231
00:09:54.015 --> 00:09:55.420
the interest rate is going to be

232
00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:57.430
10 percent or 12 percent
or eight percent."

233
00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:00.325
Whatever it is, they
would set the rate.

234
00:10:00.325 --> 00:10:02.065
Then as an investor,

235
00:10:02.065 --> 00:10:04.000
you're not really bidding
anyway, you just say,

236
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
"Okay, I'll take some
of that or I won't.

237
00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.670
I'll buy a hundred bucks
of that loan or I won't."

238
00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:16.640
Then over the years,
the platform has gotten

239
00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:20.945
more involved in setting
the terms of the transaction,

240
00:10:20.945 --> 00:10:23.810
and the role of the investors,

241
00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:26.600
the lenders has gotten
more and more passive.

242
00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:28.460
Just, okay yeah,
it can't begin on

243
00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:30.995
that or no leave me out.

244
00:10:30.995 --> 00:10:34.700
So that's has evolved over time,

245
00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:40.054
whereas when you get
to today, by now,

246
00:10:40.054 --> 00:10:43.145
about 95 percent of all

247
00:10:43.145 --> 00:10:47.870
lending on this platform is
by not retail investors,

248
00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:50.390
but just institutional
investors who

249
00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:54.290
just post a bunch of
capital, they say, "Okay.

250
00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:57.960
Prosper or Lending Club.

251
00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:03.500
We want this 10 million
bucks to just go

252
00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:06.530
to borrowers who show
up on your platform

253
00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:10.610
and will just automatically buy

254
00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:12.964
whatever loans you approve

255
00:11:12.964 --> 00:11:17.120
within this or that
risk category."

256
00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:19.895
The platforms themselves have

257
00:11:19.895 --> 00:11:23.210
greatly ramped up
their ability to

258
00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:25.745
do this risk evaluation with

259
00:11:25.745 --> 00:11:28.700
this big data machine
learning approach,

260
00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:31.220
so they've got all this data now.

261
00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:33.395
These days if you want to
borrow on Lending club,

262
00:11:33.395 --> 00:11:35.840
you supply all sorts of
financial information.

263
00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:36.890
They can browse all around

264
00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:39.005
your bank account and
all sorts of other things,

265
00:11:39.005 --> 00:11:41.660
and they've got
these algorithms they've

266
00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:43.310
developed for looking around

267
00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:44.900
your bank account and
your other financials,

268
00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:47.520
and coming up with a risk score.

269
00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:51.020
They've gotten very good at this.

270
00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:53.660
One thing I've noticed is

271
00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:57.380
that back in the early days
you might think,

272
00:11:57.380 --> 00:11:58.430
"Well, we don't need

273
00:11:58.430 --> 00:12:00.530
the lending platform to
give us a risk score.

274
00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:02.615
We already have what's
called the FICO score,

275
00:12:02.615 --> 00:12:04.250
everyone has a FICO score."

276
00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:05.720
The FICO score is a score

277
00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:07.730
developed by
the Fair Isaac Company,

278
00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:09.560
and FICO scores are everywhere.

279
00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:11.540
You've probably seen
your FICO score,

280
00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:13.130
you've used your FICO score when

281
00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:14.870
you bought a house or a car.

282
00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:16.910
So we have FICO scores,

283
00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:18.290
why don't they just
use the FICO score?

284
00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:20.870
Well, they can do much
better than the FICO score.

285
00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:25.190
Over the years, the correlation
between the score

286
00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:27.620
that the lending
platforms come up

287
00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:30.410
with in the FICO score
has just gone down,

288
00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:34.355
and the lenders credit scores
is actually now do a lot

289
00:12:34.355 --> 00:12:35.960
better in this context of

290
00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:38.405
predicting the outcome
of these loans.

291
00:12:38.405 --> 00:12:41.870
If you talk to these lenders in

292
00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:45.785
this peer-to-peer or
marketplace lending space,

293
00:12:45.785 --> 00:12:48.800
and you ask them, what's

294
00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:53.045
the social benefit of
what you guys are doing?

295
00:12:53.045 --> 00:12:54.770
Well, they'll have
various things they would

296
00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:56.960
bring up but one thing
that comes up a lot

297
00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:03.060
is what they referred to as
the invisible prime borrower.

298
00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:06.200
What they mean by that,

299
00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:07.400
let me show you some graphs

300
00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:09.185
here and I'll walk
you through them.

301
00:13:09.185 --> 00:13:12.605
What they mean by
invisible prime is that,

302
00:13:12.605 --> 00:13:15.830
if you look at all the people
who are currently

303
00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:19.535
rated subprime due
to their FICOs,

304
00:13:19.535 --> 00:13:21.650
and there's different cut-offs,

305
00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:23.900
but one popular cutoff
when you think

306
00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:27.140
about is your FICO
score to low the 680.

307
00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:31.220
If your FICO score is below
680 many people would say,

308
00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:34.310
"Well, you're a
subprime borrower."

309
00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:36.500
FICO score which
is calculated from

310
00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:40.055
your credit report is below
680, you're subprime.

311
00:13:40.055 --> 00:13:42.350
What the people at
the Lending Club and

312
00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:44.795
Prosper and so on will
say, "Well, okay.

313
00:13:44.795 --> 00:13:48.980
We can look at that population
of people below 680,

314
00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:50.870
and we can find good credits.

315
00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:52.610
We can find people who really are

316
00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:55.370
prime even though their
credit score says otherwise,

317
00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:57.770
and we're willing to loan
to them at rates that

318
00:13:57.770 --> 00:14:00.650
reflect our belief that
they really are prime."

319
00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:02.060
So here is a couple of graphs.

320
00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:05.330
Here, I got off of a paper

321
00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:07.130
written by some economists at

322
00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:09.350
the Federal Reserve Bank
of Philadelphia.

323
00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:12.470
They got the data
from Lending Club.

324
00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:14.705
If you look at these graphs here,

325
00:14:14.705 --> 00:14:17.165
let's look at
the one on the left.

326
00:14:17.165 --> 00:14:19.370
This is showing you,

327
00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:21.095
what they're saying
here is, look,

328
00:14:21.095 --> 00:14:27.455
looking just at those people
with FICOs below 680.

329
00:14:27.455 --> 00:14:30.515
When we look at
that group of people and

330
00:14:30.515 --> 00:14:35.104
we put them into risk categories
based on our algorithm,

331
00:14:35.104 --> 00:14:37.010
from A risks which are

332
00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:40.640
the best risks to the G risks
which are the worst risks.

333
00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:43.250
Look at the A risks,
and remember,

334
00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:47.689
this is only from those people
who have subprime FICOs,

335
00:14:47.689 --> 00:14:49.220
those people we do find

336
00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:53.045
these A risks are in that
population and their chance of

337
00:14:53.045 --> 00:14:56.060
default over the course of

338
00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:59.270
the two years is
just five percent, right?

339
00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:02.315
Five percent. Well, that's
a very low chances of default,

340
00:15:02.315 --> 00:15:04.205
and that's a prime borrower.

341
00:15:04.205 --> 00:15:09.005
We found that borrower in
everyone else we call subprime.

342
00:15:09.005 --> 00:15:12.350
Of course, we find
some very high risks

343
00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:14.780
in that category too
looking out at the G risks,

344
00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:17.930
they have a chance of
default over 35 percent,

345
00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:18.950
that's very high, right?

346
00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:21.080
So yes, there are
high risks there,

347
00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:23.390
but look, we can
find the low risks.

348
00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:27.500
Look at the graph on
the right-hand side.

349
00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:29.870
Here, what they're doing is

350
00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:32.750
they are within each of
their risk categories,

351
00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:36.020
or A through G, that's Lending
Club's risk categories.

352
00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:38.420
Within each of them,
they're showing you

353
00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:42.590
the performance of those accounts

354
00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:45.395
that they put in those A
through G buckets,

355
00:15:45.395 --> 00:15:49.820
broken out by what
was their FICO score.

356
00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:51.395
So if you look on the very left,

357
00:15:51.395 --> 00:15:53.105
the borrowers above A,

358
00:15:53.105 --> 00:15:58.205
this is showing you that
when they call you an A risk

359
00:15:58.205 --> 00:16:02.690
that you have
a low probability default

360
00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:06.200
whether your FICO was below 680,

361
00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:07.730
which is the blue bars, or above

362
00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:09.350
750 which is the purple bars.

363
00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:12.050
Yes, the people with
the worst FICOs are in fact

364
00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:15.245
doing a little worse
expose but still

365
00:16:15.245 --> 00:16:16.790
all of them are doing

366
00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:22.385
well as far as the risk
of the mortgage.

367
00:16:22.385 --> 00:16:24.515
So it's basically
showing you that as you

368
00:16:24.515 --> 00:16:27.170
sort people by our credit risks,

369
00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:29.180
we are capturing
the lion's share of

370
00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:32.090
the actual variation in how risky

371
00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:35.630
people really are
in the FICO score.

372
00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:38.120
On top of that, this isn't
telling you very much.

373
00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:40.130
So they've developed
an algorithm.

374
00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:41.150
Of course, they're
looking at things

375
00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:42.620
your FICO score can't look at,

376
00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:45.110
your FICO score is calculated
off your credit report.

377
00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:47.930
They are calculating this off
of all sorts of stuff that

378
00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:52.370
the FICO score cannot
be calculated off of.

379
00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:56.440
Your bank account statement
isn't on your credit report.

380
00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:57.710
All sorts of things that they can

381
00:16:57.710 --> 00:17:00.150
see are not on
your credit report.

382
00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:04.490
So this big data

383
00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:06.260
coming through for them
allowing them to make

384
00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:09.970
credit decisions which are
far more informed. All right.

385
00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:11.840
So that's the credit decision

386
00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:13.910
and the source of the
funds as they say

387
00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:15.530
institutional investors just post

388
00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:16.820
cash and that cash is what's

389
00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:19.895
used to fund the loans.

390
00:17:19.895 --> 00:17:23.645
You also have loans
that are securitized,

391
00:17:23.645 --> 00:17:27.080
which means that you
have a big bundle of

392
00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:29.900
Lending Club or
Prosper loans which

393
00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:33.699
are all pooled together,

394
00:17:33.699 --> 00:17:35.710
and then they issue securities

395
00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:37.960
backed by that pool of loans.

396
00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:39.470
Just because we had all sorts of

397
00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:41.885
securitization going into
the financial crisis,

398
00:17:41.885 --> 00:17:44.390
didn't always necessarily
work out that well.

399
00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:48.110
But that can be
a great source of funds,

400
00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:50.150
is a way that institutional
investors can buy

401
00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:56.465
these Prosper loan backed bonds
and invest in those.

402
00:17:56.465 --> 00:17:57.950
Now, one thing people often say

403
00:17:57.950 --> 00:18:00.095
about this market and
it's true is that,

404
00:18:00.095 --> 00:18:02.780
this market in
this current business model

405
00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:05.600
hasn't been tested
by a big downturn.

406
00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:09.410
So we'll see what

407
00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:10.820
happens when the economy

408
00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:13.340
turns out to the performance
of these loans.

409
00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:15.260
It's going to be a test,

410
00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:18.950
and maybe they pass that test,

411
00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:20.960
maybe they don't,
that's yet to be seen.

412
00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:22.640
So to summarize we have

413
00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:25.835
so far these
Peer-to-Peer platforms,

414
00:18:25.835 --> 00:18:28.745
they're offering
an alternative to consumers.

415
00:18:28.745 --> 00:18:30.440
An alternative way to

416
00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:33.440
refinance out of
your credit card debt.

417
00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:36.005
You already had helocks

418
00:18:36.005 --> 00:18:40.235
that can give you a nice rate
but there's a risk to that.

419
00:18:40.235 --> 00:18:42.980
You can go to this
other platform instead,

420
00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:44.810
maybe can borrow
at a better rate.

421
00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:48.870
The platforms have

422
00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:53.480
very accurate credit
scoring algorithms

423
00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:56.300
that can find that
invisible prime borrower,

424
00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:58.250
and bring to that person
the kind of rate that

425
00:18:58.250 --> 00:19:00.770
they in some sense earned with

426
00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:03.125
their management or finances that

427
00:19:03.125 --> 00:19:05.330
the platform can see with all

428
00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:07.940
the browsing around that they do.

429
00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:13.190
This really isn't a retail
investment play anymore.

430
00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:14.600
That's really not
the way this works.

431
00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:16.970
It's not peers loaning
peers anymore.

432
00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:20.330
It's big institutions posting
the cash that is going to

433
00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:23.900
be invested based on these
very sophisticated algorithms.

434
00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:26.210
Okay? So that's
the peer-to-peer lending,

435
00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:27.840
and the next thing we're talking
about in the next module

436
00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:30.330
is going to be the student loans.
