1
00:00:04.277 --> 00:00:08.922
Okay, well, there's a special kind
of marketplace lending that is

2
00:00:08.922 --> 00:00:12.379
aimed at small business,
especially retailers.

3
00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:16.440
Okay, so now we're a small business and
not your consumer borrower.

4
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.998
So I'm talking here about lending
by companies that are called

5
00:00:20.998 --> 00:00:25.822
payment aggregators, and
the biggest example of this is Square.

6
00:00:25.822 --> 00:00:29.999
You've probably seen Square
when you go to a coffee shop or

7
00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:35.640
other small retailer, they ring you up
on this distinctive Square hardware.

8
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.323
Well, okay, that Square is one of these,
but there are others.

9
00:00:40.323 --> 00:00:45.476
And they have expanded
on an old idea which

10
00:00:45.476 --> 00:00:50.933
is known as a merchant cash advance, okay?

11
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:53.842
And so I'm going to walk
through what this is, and

12
00:00:53.842 --> 00:00:56.768
through what their special
advantage is here.

13
00:00:56.768 --> 00:01:02.473
And how this has turned into a big
business, both for the payment aggregators

14
00:01:02.473 --> 00:01:07.762
and also for the retailers as a big
source of funding for the retailers.

15
00:01:07.762 --> 00:01:13.951
The payment aggregators like Square,
they see every sale you make,

16
00:01:13.951 --> 00:01:19.405
every tip a customer makes,
every time someone uses a card.

17
00:01:19.405 --> 00:01:23.895
And they can also potentially see other
payment, even the cash payments that

18
00:01:23.895 --> 00:01:27.986
people make in your business, okay,
they see all that information.

19
00:01:27.986 --> 00:01:32.723
Okay, and so with that level of
information about your business, and

20
00:01:32.723 --> 00:01:37.622
of course, information about other
businesses in your same industry,

21
00:01:37.622 --> 00:01:40.771
other businesses in
your same neighborhood.

22
00:01:40.771 --> 00:01:46.632
They've got tremendous amount of data
about your future prospects, and maybe

23
00:01:46.632 --> 00:01:52.419
they can also make a judgement about the
benefit that you would get from a loan.

24
00:01:52.419 --> 00:01:56.381
If they were to loan you 10,000 bucks or
whatever,

25
00:01:56.381 --> 00:02:01.427
they could see how you could potentially
use that to grow your business.

26
00:02:01.427 --> 00:02:05.116
So once again, Big Data there,
they see every transaction you make,

27
00:02:05.116 --> 00:02:08.505
they see all sorts of other
transactions in your neighborhood.

28
00:02:08.505 --> 00:02:13.353
They see coffee shops just
like yours in other towns, and

29
00:02:13.353 --> 00:02:19.312
they have all this information that
they can see about your business,

30
00:02:19.312 --> 00:02:25.679
and that would help them think about
potentially making you a loan, okay?

31
00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:31.056
And so they can make you a loan, and the
loan may take the form of okay, I'll show

32
00:02:31.056 --> 00:02:36.543
up right there on your on your hardware,
your Square hardware at your business.

33
00:02:36.543 --> 00:02:41.939
That okay,
we are willing to loan you 10,000 bucks.

34
00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:43.550
All right, loan you 10,000 bucks.

35
00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:50.146
And if we loan you 10,000 bucks you
have to repay us 11,000 bucks, okay?

36
00:02:50.146 --> 00:02:53.937
So they can make that offer,
and as I say, they can see so

37
00:02:53.937 --> 00:02:58.537
much information about you,
they can make a pretty advanced credit

38
00:02:58.537 --> 00:03:01.945
granting decision of whether
this is a good idea.

39
00:03:01.945 --> 00:03:09.236
And furthermore, and this is sort of
the beauty part from their point of view,

40
00:03:09.236 --> 00:03:13.224
they've got a huge advantage over a bank.

41
00:03:13.224 --> 00:03:15.935
Right, so
let's say a bank loaned you 10,000 bucks,

42
00:03:15.935 --> 00:03:19.829
they give you 10,000 bucks and now you
have to pay them back 11,000 bucks.

43
00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:24.528
Well, of course the bank
has to hope that you

44
00:03:24.528 --> 00:03:29.231
see it as worth your
while to repay the loan.

45
00:03:29.231 --> 00:03:32.739
Then once they give you the 10,000 bucks,
and

46
00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.883
now you've got money coming in and
you have the bank loan, but

47
00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:42.160
you also have your payroll, you can buy
more inventory, you can pay the rent.

48
00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.325
Whatever it is, you have all these
expenses, the bank is just one of them.

49
00:03:45.325 --> 00:03:47.204
Maybe you pay the bank,
maybe you don't, right?

50
00:03:47.204 --> 00:03:53.052
So you have some discretion over when
you pay the bank and how much, okay?

51
00:03:53.052 --> 00:03:56.056
So the bank has to worry about that.

52
00:03:56.056 --> 00:03:59.995
So the big advantage of
the payment aggregator,

53
00:03:59.995 --> 00:04:04.990
such as Square, is that all
the money that people are spending

54
00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:09.716
at your store goes through them
before it gets back to you.

55
00:04:09.716 --> 00:04:14.016
Every time someone uses a card
they process that payment, and

56
00:04:14.016 --> 00:04:18.399
what they can do is they can take
their repayment of the loan they

57
00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:23.212
made you directly out of your cash
flow before you even get it, okay?

58
00:04:23.212 --> 00:04:27.920
And so what this does for you is
allows you to credibly commit to repay

59
00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.637
the loan because yeah, they can take
it right out of your cash flow.

60
00:04:32.637 --> 00:04:36.012
There's no worry there that
once you get your money,

61
00:04:36.012 --> 00:04:39.919
then you're going to maybe spend
it on something else, right?

62
00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:42.953
You can credibly commit that
you will repay it because hey,

63
00:04:42.953 --> 00:04:46.424
they know it because they can take
it directly out of your cash flow.

64
00:04:46.424 --> 00:04:51.735
So it allows a small retailer
to borrow in a way that would

65
00:04:51.735 --> 00:04:58.855
be very difficult to borrow from some
external source like a bank, right?

66
00:04:58.855 --> 00:05:02.168
They're borrowing directly from
the from the organization that's

67
00:05:02.168 --> 00:05:04.465
processing their payments
in the first place.

68
00:05:04.465 --> 00:05:09.021
Okay now, as I said, this is this is
not by itself a completely new idea,

69
00:05:09.021 --> 00:05:13.808
the idea of a merchant cash advance,
where the institution processing your

70
00:05:13.808 --> 00:05:17.962
payments is taking the repayment
directly out of your cash flow.

71
00:05:17.962 --> 00:05:20.826
This has been around for years.

72
00:05:20.826 --> 00:05:27.118
The sort of special sauce here is
this kind of big data approach,

73
00:05:27.118 --> 00:05:33.308
that Square can see not just you but
people like you elsewhere.

74
00:05:33.308 --> 00:05:38.394
People in your neighborhood
transacting with sort of the same

75
00:05:38.394 --> 00:05:43.382
customer base,
making their other sorts of transactions,

76
00:05:43.382 --> 00:05:47.410
the dry cleaners,
the Bodega, whatever it is.

77
00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:52.475
They see that too, and
that helps them think about your ability

78
00:05:52.475 --> 00:05:58.608
to repay the loan, and the use to which
you could put the money from the loan.

79
00:05:58.608 --> 00:06:03.986
So this is a tremendous advantage, if you
look at, I keep bringing up Square because

80
00:06:03.986 --> 00:06:09.017
this is just an interesting example,
Square went public just a few years ago.

81
00:06:09.017 --> 00:06:13.423
People really weren't talking about
Square Capital so much at the time, but

82
00:06:13.423 --> 00:06:17.167
Square Capital, that's the division
of Square that does this.

83
00:06:17.167 --> 00:06:21.688
This has of course taken of now as
a big source of their revenue and

84
00:06:21.688 --> 00:06:25.723
a big source of funding for
retailers in the country now.

85
00:06:25.723 --> 00:06:30.101
And it's also, as I said,
called marketplace lending here,

86
00:06:30.101 --> 00:06:33.334
because not only are they
making these loans.

87
00:06:33.334 --> 00:06:37.723
But also they're providing this as an
opportunity to institutional investors to

88
00:06:37.723 --> 00:06:40.083
front the cash that they then loan, right?

89
00:06:40.083 --> 00:06:44.346
So a lot of the cash they loan is not
really their own cash, it is posted by

90
00:06:44.346 --> 00:06:49.199
the institutional investors who want to
essentially buy a piece of this action.

91
00:06:49.199 --> 00:06:52.568
They want to be making these
loans to these retailers.

92
00:06:52.568 --> 00:06:58.104
They like the story and so they supply
the capital that then gets loaned out.

93
00:06:58.104 --> 00:07:03.129
So to summarize that,
basically, this is the way

94
00:07:03.129 --> 00:07:08.275
that small business is
borrowing at rates that take

95
00:07:08.275 --> 00:07:13.420
advantage of the lenders'
ability to number one,

96
00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:18.343
make a very informed
credit granting decision.

97
00:07:18.343 --> 00:07:26.413
Based not only on the finances of
this company but companies like them.

98
00:07:26.413 --> 00:07:31.692
And then number two, takes advantage
of this ability to take the cash

99
00:07:31.692 --> 00:07:37.804
flow directly out of the company's
revenues and pay themselves off directly.

100
00:07:37.804 --> 00:07:42.999
And that allows this small retailer,
the small bodega, the dry cleaner,

101
00:07:42.999 --> 00:07:47.782
whatever it is, to borrow on terms
that probably are a lot better than

102
00:07:47.782 --> 00:07:52.337
they would get if they were to go
to an external source like a bank.
