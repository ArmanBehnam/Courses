00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:07.380
Hi. Well, the next few
sessions cover what

2
00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.425
we used to call
peer-to-peer lending.

3
00:00:10.425 --> 00:00:12.690
That name peer-to-peer lending

4
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.685
is kind of falling out of use.

5
00:00:14.685 --> 00:00:16.260
What you'll hear more and more in

6
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.095
its place is marketplace lending.

7
00:00:19.095 --> 00:00:21.210
That name change reflects

8
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.420
the industry's pivot
since it's early days,

9
00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:24.570
I'm going to say early days,

10
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.180
I'm only talking about 2006.

11
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.940
But back then when

12
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.025
people talked about
peer-to-peer lending,

13
00:00:32.025 --> 00:00:33.810
it was all about using

14
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.915
the internet to take
out the middleman.

15
00:00:36.915 --> 00:00:38.400
To take out
the middle man, right?

16
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.120
So the idea was that
you have some people

17
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.900
who for reasons coming up

18
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.480
in their lives need to
borrow some money right now.

19
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.289
Others find themselves
a little extra cash and

20
00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:53.090
so wouldn't it be nice
if the people with

21
00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.730
little extra cash would loan
to the people who need it.

22
00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:01.730
The goal of this
peer-to-peer platform

23
00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.630
was just allow those people
to find each other,

24
00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.430
find the terms on which they

25
00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.470
could transact with each other,

26
00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.925
and then process
it going forward.

27
00:01:11.925 --> 00:01:14.495
Move the money in
one direction and then when

28
00:01:14.495 --> 00:01:17.060
people can pay it back
then move the money back.

29
00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.290
So that was sort of the idea.

30
00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.030
Use the Internet to match

31
00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.040
up people who are
just naturally at

32
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.975
this moment in their lives

33
00:01:23.975 --> 00:01:26.875
lenders or naturally borrowers.

34
00:01:26.875 --> 00:01:30.125
Okay. So that was
the original idea.

35
00:01:30.125 --> 00:01:34.100
What's happened over the years
and we'll talk about this,

36
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.770
is that the platform has gone

37
00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.680
from that sort of passive role
or you have just let

38
00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.165
people find each other to
the a very active role

39
00:01:44.165 --> 00:01:49.005
of essentially making
the real decision,

40
00:01:49.005 --> 00:01:51.320
making the real
credit-granting decisions.

41
00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.510
So you have a potential borrower

42
00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.015
shows up with
financial information.

43
00:01:56.015 --> 00:02:00.680
Now it's really the Internet
platform itself that makes

44
00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.050
all the decision about
whether that person gets

45
00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.410
money how much and on what terms,

46
00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:07.940
and the providers of funds

47
00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.415
really that's not
the retail public anymore,

48
00:02:11.415 --> 00:02:13.865
now it's big
institutional investors.

49
00:02:13.865 --> 00:02:15.935
So when people look at that

50
00:02:15.935 --> 00:02:18.410
they don't really think

51
00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:19.470
of it as peer-to-peer
lending it's

52
00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.940
not really what's going on,

53
00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.120
so they've come to call
it marketplace lending.

54
00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.615
So that's really the term
that you'll see in the press.

55
00:02:26.615 --> 00:02:29.300
Okay. So first, I want to just

56
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.240
cover the landscape
of consumer credit.

57
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.575
Just all the different kinds
of consumer credit

58
00:02:36.575 --> 00:02:40.220
that are big parts
of the economy.

59
00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.920
What are the kind
of pinpoints you

60
00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.120
could call them in these

61
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.740
different types of
consumer credit

62
00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.870
and how those open up

63
00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.430
opportunities

64
00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.880
for the FinTech lenders
for marketplace lending.

65
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.090
So let's cover
the landscape and then

66
00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.610
we'll talk about peer
to peer lending.

67
00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.870
So what the original idea
of it, how it worked,

68
00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.335
what came up, and then how it
evolved to what we see now.

69
00:03:09.335 --> 00:03:13.070
There's going to be two flavors
that we'll talk about.

70
00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:19.385
One is really aimed at
helping people get out of

71
00:03:19.385 --> 00:03:23.600
their credit card debt
to help them shift out

72
00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.640
of credit card debt into new debt

73
00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.980
that is going to be a
little less onerous,

74
00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.750
and the other major piece of it

75
00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.915
is going to be student loans.

76
00:03:31.915 --> 00:03:35.540
Student loans we'll see
some numbers in a moment here.

77
00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.880
Student loans have
grown to be the kind of

78
00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.245
the big financial issue of
our days and you'll see how

79
00:03:42.245 --> 00:03:49.504
FinTech has entered the student
loan market with products

80
00:03:49.504 --> 00:03:53.330
that help people refinance
their way out of

81
00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.310
the student loans and once
again to something maybe

82
00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.290
with a slightly
lower interest rate,

83
00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.420
though there's going to
be a caveat there that

84
00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.745
we're going to want to focus on.

85
00:04:01.745 --> 00:04:04.625
Okay. Finally, I want
to say just a few words

86
00:04:04.625 --> 00:04:07.910
about another aspect of

87
00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:09.320
marketplace lending which isn't

88
00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.525
loan lending to consumers,

89
00:04:11.525 --> 00:04:13.790
it's lending to small business

90
00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.280
with what we call
merchant cash advances.
