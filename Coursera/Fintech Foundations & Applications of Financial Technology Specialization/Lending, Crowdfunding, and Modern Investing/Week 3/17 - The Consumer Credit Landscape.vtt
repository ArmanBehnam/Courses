1
00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.660
So let's talk about the
consumer credit landscape

2
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.430
just to sort of get us started.

3
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.405
So first, just think about
a household balance sheet.

4
00:00:12.405 --> 00:00:15.330
Household balance sheet,
the liabilities and the assets.

5
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.039
If you look at the assets

6
00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.100
of typical household, what
are you going to see?

7
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.655
Well, you've got
the physical assets.

8
00:00:23.655 --> 00:00:28.010
Usually you've got a house and

9
00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.000
you probably have a car
maybe couple of cars.

10
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.470
Well, now if you're lucky,

11
00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.260
you've got a boat and
you've got a vacation home.

12
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:37.760
Lots of things you might see.

13
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.240
But typically, what
do you think about?

14
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.440
You're thinking about
a house and one or two cars.

15
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.400
You got those physical assets
and then you've

16
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.790
got some financial assets,
your retirement savings,

17
00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.530
you've got your 401K

18
00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.430
or other sorts of
retirement savings,

19
00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.085
maybe you've got some other
investments you've got going,

20
00:00:58.085 --> 00:01:00.665
you'll see those assets as well.

21
00:01:00.665 --> 00:01:03.395
Then of course you've
got another asset

22
00:01:03.395 --> 00:01:07.010
of the household is going
to be the human capital,

23
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.630
the skills and experience
that members of

24
00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.270
the household have
acquired which are going

25
00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.665
to be valuable for
them going forward,

26
00:01:17.665 --> 00:01:20.885
giving them the possibility to

27
00:01:20.885 --> 00:01:24.450
add value and make
money in years to come.

28
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.525
So those are the assets
you're going to see.

29
00:01:26.525 --> 00:01:28.010
What about the liabilities?

30
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.820
Well, now you're going to
see and the liability side,

31
00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.860
you're going to see
the debt that was

32
00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.520
incurred in acquiring
those assets.

33
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.690
So you have a house.

34
00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.940
Well, you have the mortgage
that helped you buy

35
00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.460
the house and you have cars.

36
00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:44.915
Well, very often you have

37
00:01:44.915 --> 00:01:47.375
car loans that helped
you buy the cars.

38
00:01:47.375 --> 00:01:50.840
Then for that human capital,

39
00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.395
well there's the student loans.

40
00:01:53.395 --> 00:01:57.500
You have student loans
that you took out to pay

41
00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.530
the tuition so that
you can go to school,

42
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.500
get that degree, get the training

43
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.810
and now have that human capital.

44
00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.090
So you have that too. What
else you're going to see?

45
00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:09.950
Well, there can be credit
card debt that you

46
00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.890
incurred for whatever
purpose and of course,

47
00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.650
there could be
some other debt too.

48
00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.770
Here is a graph that

49
00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.510
I got off the website of

50
00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.000
the Federal Reserve Bank
of New York.

51
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.270
This is actually a great
website for you guys

52
00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.300
to look at in your spare time.

53
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.280
They've got consumer credit,

54
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.050
sort of sliced and
diced every way,

55
00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:39.220
sort of quantities and interest
rates and delinquency,

56
00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.905
all the different sort
of statistics,

57
00:02:41.905 --> 00:02:44.450
warning signs and so on you
might be interested in.

58
00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.160
I just picked off here
their summary chart

59
00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.730
showing just total household
debt evolving over time.

60
00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.910
So you look at
this graph here we're

61
00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.290
seeing household debt in the US,

62
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.575
total household debt
evolving from the beginning

63
00:03:03.575 --> 00:03:08.240
of 2003 all the way
to the end of 2018.

64
00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.735
So every bar here is a quarter.

65
00:03:11.735 --> 00:03:14.015
So the total height of the bar is

66
00:03:14.015 --> 00:03:16.010
all household debt and then

67
00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.060
the different colors are

68
00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.745
the different types
of household debt.

69
00:03:19.745 --> 00:03:21.470
You see the orange
is the biggest.

70
00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.330
That's your mortgage debt.

71
00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.880
Then you've also got
home equity lines.

72
00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.130
You've got car loans.

73
00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:29.840
You've got credit card debt.

74
00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.360
You've got your student debt
and then finally,

75
00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:33.635
one sort of catch-all for the

76
00:03:33.635 --> 00:03:35.060
other which is where by the way,

77
00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.915
all the FinTech lending is
going to show up, a lot of it.

78
00:03:38.915 --> 00:03:40.550
So you look at this graph you

79
00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:41.920
see well, one thing of course.

80
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.580
You see the big picture there.

81
00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.670
You can see which looks
very gentle here.

82
00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.345
It wasn't gentle
when it happened.

83
00:03:47.345 --> 00:03:49.120
It was the financial
crisis right.

84
00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.160
You can see the ramp up,

85
00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.355
you can see more
debt through like

86
00:03:52.355 --> 00:03:55.055
09 or so and then it comes off.

87
00:03:55.055 --> 00:03:56.570
Why is it coming off?
Well, of course,

88
00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.490
you can see mortgages
go up and come down.

89
00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:00.830
A lot of that would
be of course for

90
00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.990
closures and other
problems like that.

91
00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:07.260
So you see consumer debt come up,

92
00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.210
go down and then it is
recovering and it's now

93
00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:15.950
actually higher than it was
at the peak of the crisis.

94
00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.670
But if you look closely, you
see that the mortgage debts,

95
00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:21.350
the biggest part
of it but it's not

96
00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:23.750
because of mortgage
debt that we are

97
00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.670
now in a situation of

98
00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:28.320
more debt than we had at
the peak of the crisis.

99
00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.500
The mortgage debt has not
actually recovered all

100
00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.005
the way to where it
was at its peak.

101
00:04:33.005 --> 00:04:38.600
It's the other elements
that have driven us higher.

102
00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.110
Here's a graph.

103
00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:41.975
Let me just walk you
through what's on this.

104
00:04:41.975 --> 00:04:43.340
On this graph all I've done is,

105
00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.555
I've taken all the
non-mortgage parts

106
00:04:47.555 --> 00:04:52.710
of consumer credit and
graphed them separately here.

107
00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.320
Each line here it's just taken

108
00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:55.730
that same graph
before and now I'm

109
00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:58.910
graphing everything
but the mortgage debt.

110
00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:00.950
So you see this one line showing

111
00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:03.800
us the home equity loans
and then the car loans,

112
00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.215
credit cards, student
loans and everything else.

113
00:05:06.215 --> 00:05:08.450
Let me just pull out
what I think are

114
00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:12.875
the key trends to
notice in this graph.

115
00:05:12.875 --> 00:05:17.330
So one thing you'll
notice here is that

116
00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.080
credit card debt it

117
00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.230
came off a bit after
the peak and its comeback.

118
00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:26.390
It's right about now at where

119
00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:28.760
it was at the maximum has when

120
00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.650
people were taken down
their cards to deal with

121
00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.470
the crisis in like 09 or so.

122
00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:37.130
So it came off a bit again
and then has come up.

123
00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:38.615
Not a whole lot of
movement there.

124
00:05:38.615 --> 00:05:41.000
Home equity lines have
fallen off a lot.

125
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.890
They're almost down
like half of what they

126
00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:46.005
were borrowing under
home equity lines.

127
00:05:46.005 --> 00:05:50.360
Then you'll see what's
really taken off.

128
00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:56.520
Actually taken off here is
student loans and car loans.

129
00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:57.885
Now student loans.

130
00:05:57.885 --> 00:05:59.340
Look at that student loan line,

131
00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.450
that purple line there.

132
00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.590
Notice how much has gone up

133
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:04.985
and almost in a straight line.

134
00:06:04.985 --> 00:06:07.865
In 2003, you're looking at

135
00:06:07.865 --> 00:06:12.205
about a quarter trillion
dollars total of student loans.

136
00:06:12.205 --> 00:06:17.655
End of 2018, $1.5 trillion
of student loans.

137
00:06:17.655 --> 00:06:22.430
That's a sixfold increase
over those years.

138
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:23.750
That's an enormous increase.

139
00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:25.190
That's really as I said,

140
00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:27.950
the major consumer credit
story of our time.

141
00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:29.780
So student loans have

142
00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:31.760
gone up a lot and you
can see also the other.

143
00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.280
Look at the red line
there, car loans.

144
00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.695
Car loans have really
taken off too.

145
00:06:36.695 --> 00:06:40.520
Car loans are about half
a trillion more than they

146
00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:45.475
were when they bottomed out
about six years before.

147
00:06:45.475 --> 00:06:47.690
Also notice the other

148
00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:51.020
does this catch all sort of
other term that actually has

149
00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:52.520
been trending up over

150
00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.050
the past five or six years

151
00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:56.240
as the home equity lines
have gone down.

152
00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:00.380
So now there's
about $410 billion of this

153
00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:04.535
other which is something we
want to keep our eye on here.

154
00:07:04.535 --> 00:07:07.280
So every sort of

155
00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:13.765
consumer credit is ripe
for disruption by FinTech.

156
00:07:13.765 --> 00:07:16.650
Mortgages.

157
00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:20.685
Now the largest mortgage lender

158
00:07:20.685 --> 00:07:23.925
in the country is Quicken.
All right, Quicken.

159
00:07:23.925 --> 00:07:26.435
They grew out of helping
you with your taxes, right?

160
00:07:26.435 --> 00:07:30.240
Well, Quicken is now
the largest mortgage lender.

161
00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:32.640
Other FinTechs that
focus on car loans,

162
00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:34.290
as you see car loans
have taken off.

163
00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:35.910
But we're going to focus here,

164
00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:36.810
because we're thinking about

165
00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:38.760
marketplace lending,
peer-to-peer lending.

166
00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:41.805
This is really about
the unsecured,

167
00:07:41.805 --> 00:07:44.460
uncollateralized
part of the market,

168
00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:45.720
so not borrowing to buy a house,

169
00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:47.460
borrowing to buy a car,

170
00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:48.970
it's loans that are

171
00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:51.600
not secured by anything
in particular.

172
00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:55.890
The main elements of consumer
credit that that's going

173
00:07:55.890 --> 00:08:01.580
to mean is the credit card
debt and the student loans.

174
00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:03.375
Okay, and of course
it's going to,

175
00:08:03.375 --> 00:08:04.979
there's this other category,

176
00:08:04.979 --> 00:08:06.705
is going to come up.

177
00:08:06.705 --> 00:08:09.555
Okay, so credit cards.

178
00:08:09.555 --> 00:08:11.465
Okay, thing about credit cards,

179
00:08:11.465 --> 00:08:13.390
credit cards where
do they come from?

180
00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:16.050
Credit cards entered
our economy like 50,

181
00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:18.970
60 years ago, originally
all about convenience.

182
00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:21.180
That's maybe why you got
a card in the first place.

183
00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:23.435
Just convenience.

184
00:08:23.435 --> 00:08:25.180
You run up charges
during the month,

185
00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:26.415
pay at the end of the month.

186
00:08:26.415 --> 00:08:29.255
But even if you got
it for convenience,

187
00:08:29.255 --> 00:08:32.625
at some point you hit
a rough patch and it's just

188
00:08:32.625 --> 00:08:34.260
not a good time to

189
00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.270
pay that whole balance
if you don't have to,

190
00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:38.250
and of course, you don't have to.

191
00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:39.605
You can just pay some of

192
00:08:39.605 --> 00:08:41.780
the balance and now
you're borrowing.

193
00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:43.470
Now you're borrowing on your card

194
00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:45.335
and you're paying the rate,

195
00:08:45.335 --> 00:08:46.560
that maybe you didn't
even think much

196
00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:47.760
about when you took out the card.

197
00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.375
What rate would they charge you,

198
00:08:49.375 --> 00:08:51.755
if you start running a balance
but now you're paying it.

199
00:08:51.755 --> 00:08:53.460
Right, and that could
be a big number, right.

200
00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:54.810
You could be talking about 15,

201
00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:58.355
16 up to 20 percent
that you're paying

202
00:08:58.355 --> 00:09:01.050
now for that loan that

203
00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:03.800
you've taken out by not
paying your full balance.

204
00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:08.010
Okay. So you're paying a big
interest rate on this loan.

205
00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:09.390
It's not a collateralized loan.

206
00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:10.480
The credit card company has

207
00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:13.560
no claim on any particular
collateral there,

208
00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:15.390
and that's of course
that's part of

209
00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:18.800
why they're charging
you a big rate.

210
00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:22.560
So now you've hit a rough patch,

211
00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:23.855
you're borrowing on your card,

212
00:09:23.855 --> 00:09:25.785
you're paying a big rate,
what can you do about it?

213
00:09:25.785 --> 00:09:28.170
How can you lower
your interest rate?

214
00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:29.895
Well, of course, to
some extent you maybe can

215
00:09:29.895 --> 00:09:31.745
move your balance to
another card or to

216
00:09:31.745 --> 00:09:33.510
another company once
you are balanced

217
00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:35.450
and so they'll give
you a lower rate.

218
00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:36.790
That can happen, and

219
00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:38.880
of course that happen,
people do that.

220
00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:41.310
If that's not so feasible,

221
00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:43.325
another thing people
have often done

222
00:09:43.325 --> 00:09:45.660
is take out a home-equity line.

223
00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:48.790
Those home-equity lines we
just saw on that graph.

224
00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:49.800
So home-equity line.

225
00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:52.710
Now you are taking out
a new loan which is basically

226
00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:55.050
a second mortgage on
your house coming

227
00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:58.305
in second after
your first mortgage.

228
00:09:58.305 --> 00:10:02.175
And you can get
a nice interest rate that way.

229
00:10:02.175 --> 00:10:04.050
Why are you getting
a nice interest rate?

230
00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:05.230
You're getting
a nice interest rate

231
00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:06.790
because you've
pledged your house.

232
00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:08.050
Right, you've pledged your house.

233
00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:12.160
You've given a claim on
your house to this new lender,

234
00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.460
that's why they're willing
to give you a low rate.

235
00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:16.830
But of course the other side
of that coin is,

236
00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:23.705
now you have increased
the risk of foreclosure,

237
00:10:23.705 --> 00:10:27.590
losing your house in
foreclosure if things go bad,

238
00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:29.530
and when things did go bad in

239
00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:31.755
the crisis that's of course
exactly what happened.

240
00:10:31.755 --> 00:10:35.465
So HELOCs if people call
home-equity line of credit.

241
00:10:35.465 --> 00:10:36.720
HELOCs are a way

242
00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:39.270
to refinance out
your credit card debt at

243
00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:44.650
a lower rate but with
that risk, right? So okay.

244
00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:46.335
So bear that in mind,
we'll get back to that.

245
00:10:46.335 --> 00:10:47.520
Let's just think about student

246
00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:49.440
loan debt for a second here.

247
00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:53.025
So student loan debt
has gone way up.

248
00:10:53.025 --> 00:10:55.100
You can see in part, to
some extent, this is,

249
00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:57.720
you can say there's a perspective
once that's good news.

250
00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:00.150
People are borrowing to
build their human capital.

251
00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:02.940
The human capital is going
to be valuable to them,

252
00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:05.150
help them make money
down the road.

253
00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:09.335
But, even so there's a sense
in which it's good news.

254
00:11:09.335 --> 00:11:14.280
Obviously that gigantic
ramp up in debt does flag

255
00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:16.695
that something's
not going to plan.

256
00:11:16.695 --> 00:11:18.435
People are borrowing
money that they have

257
00:11:18.435 --> 00:11:20.895
trouble then paying off,

258
00:11:20.895 --> 00:11:24.870
and this is going to cause
trouble down the road.

259
00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:28.500
Now why is the student loan
balance growing so much?

260
00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:30.835
Well, there's
a subtle point here.

261
00:11:30.835 --> 00:11:32.580
You might think, well,

262
00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:33.840
student loan balance goes

263
00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:35.435
up because people keep borrowing.

264
00:11:35.435 --> 00:11:37.565
Of course, that's part of it.

265
00:11:37.565 --> 00:11:40.740
But an actual, in some sense,

266
00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:43.445
bigger part of why it just
keeps going up and up and up,

267
00:11:43.445 --> 00:11:47.935
is that when students,

268
00:11:47.935 --> 00:11:53.975
when graduates hit a rough patch
with their student loan,

269
00:11:53.975 --> 00:11:56.430
they can, these days,

270
00:11:56.430 --> 00:12:00.525
take advantage of what's called
income-driven repayment.

271
00:12:00.525 --> 00:12:01.950
Income-driven repayment.

272
00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:03.095
I'm just going to sketch this.

273
00:12:03.095 --> 00:12:04.445
If you want to learn
more about it,

274
00:12:04.445 --> 00:12:06.720
go to the Department
of Education website,

275
00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:08.205
they'll walk you through
the whole thing.

276
00:12:08.205 --> 00:12:10.910
Let me just sketch what
income-driven repayment is.

277
00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:12.450
What it is, is that
if you're having

278
00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:14.025
trouble paying your student loan,

279
00:12:14.025 --> 00:12:15.915
you can have your monthly payment

280
00:12:15.915 --> 00:12:18.335
reduced to a number
which is basically

281
00:12:18.335 --> 00:12:22.890
10 percent of
your disposable income.

282
00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:25.450
Where they take your total
income and they subtract

283
00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:27.875
out a subsistence
amount of income,

284
00:12:27.875 --> 00:12:32.160
which is essentially 150 percent
of the poverty level.

285
00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:33.690
They remove that
from your income,

286
00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:34.865
look at what's left and they say,

287
00:12:34.865 --> 00:12:38.630
okay, 10 percent of that
will now be your payment.

288
00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:40.745
So you can have it reduced to

289
00:12:40.745 --> 00:12:44.895
10 percent of
this discretionary income.

290
00:12:44.895 --> 00:12:47.940
But, okay, so
your payment is reduced

291
00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:49.060
but in fact there's no real

292
00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:50.640
forgiveness here at this point.

293
00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:52.300
So if the payment
you're making is

294
00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:54.870
not covering the interest
that you owe,

295
00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:57.440
then the interest you
didn't pay is going to be

296
00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:00.085
added to what you still owe.

297
00:13:00.085 --> 00:13:02.255
So in fact your balance
could be going up.

298
00:13:02.255 --> 00:13:03.815
Could be going up while you

299
00:13:03.815 --> 00:13:05.985
are on income-driven repayment.

300
00:13:05.985 --> 00:13:07.380
It could keep going up

301
00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:10.330
and ultimately what
happens with that,

302
00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:12.335
well what happens is
that if you stick with

303
00:13:12.335 --> 00:13:15.035
it to 20 years, right,

304
00:13:15.035 --> 00:13:17.920
after 20 years, then at 20 years

305
00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:20.990
whatever you still owe is
going to be discharged.

306
00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:22.800
Okay, be discharged so

307
00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:24.465
that one is you don't
owe it anymore.

308
00:13:24.465 --> 00:13:26.680
So your balance can

309
00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:28.530
grow over time and eventually
there's a discharge.

310
00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:30.540
So part of what we're seeing in

311
00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:34.100
this growth in student debt,

312
00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:36.095
is this dynamic happening.

313
00:13:36.095 --> 00:13:37.935
Let me just show you
one more graph from

314
00:13:37.935 --> 00:13:41.460
the Department
of Education website.

315
00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:45.800
This is showing you over
just a 5.5 year period.

316
00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:48.685
Over 5.5 year period
it's showing you,

317
00:13:48.685 --> 00:13:50.369
with the different colors,

318
00:13:50.369 --> 00:13:56.355
the different repayment programs
that graduates are in.

319
00:13:56.355 --> 00:13:58.595
The green that you
see in this graph

320
00:13:58.595 --> 00:14:01.040
is people as the total number of

321
00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:06.150
dollars in just regular fixed
payment repayment program.

322
00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:07.800
The purple is people making,

323
00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:09.495
what's called graduated
payments where they

324
00:14:09.495 --> 00:14:11.890
are scheduled to go up over time.

325
00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:15.450
The orange, the orange is
this income-driven repayment.

326
00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:16.655
This is showing you

327
00:14:16.655 --> 00:14:19.365
the total number of dollars
in income-driven repayment.

328
00:14:19.365 --> 00:14:22.550
Notice in just over 5.5 years
how much that's gone up.

329
00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:24.095
All right, just 5.5
years it's gone

330
00:14:24.095 --> 00:14:25.835
up by a few hundred
billion dollars.

331
00:14:25.835 --> 00:14:28.125
Okay so this is

332
00:14:28.125 --> 00:14:30.880
happening in big scale
in real time right now,

333
00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:37.230
and it's part of why
student debt keeps going up,

334
00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:38.840
and it's also
something to bear in

335
00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:41.620
mind when we get to talking about

336
00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:43.900
the FinTechs because
the thing I want you

337
00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:46.180
to bear in mind for
yourself is that if

338
00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:47.890
you refinance out of

339
00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:50.845
your student loan into
a new loan from a FinTech,

340
00:14:50.845 --> 00:14:54.080
you cannot do income-driven
repayment anymore.

341
00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:56.080
It's only for people

342
00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:58.540
who still have their original
federal student loan.

343
00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:00.410
Okay. So bear that in

344
00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:02.735
mind and just bear
another thing in mind,

345
00:15:02.735 --> 00:15:05.270
which is that when you

346
00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:08.470
take out a student loan
in the first place,

347
00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:10.890
you and everyone else who
took out a student loan

348
00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:13.200
at the same time are
paying the same rate.

349
00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:15.870
Okay, so think about this past.

350
00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:19.065
There's this school year
that's just wrapping up

351
00:15:19.065 --> 00:15:21.640
here at the University
of Pennsylvania,

352
00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:24.460
we are wrapping up
the 2018-19 school year.

353
00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:26.780
Well, if you took out
a student loan for

354
00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:29.370
the 2018-19 school year,

355
00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:33.580
then your interest rate was,

356
00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:35.969
well I can tell you that
if you were an undergrad,

357
00:15:35.969 --> 00:15:39.170
your interest rate
was 5.05 percent,

358
00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:40.935
and if you were
a graduate student,

359
00:15:40.935 --> 00:15:43.035
it was 6.6 percent.

360
00:15:43.035 --> 00:15:44.615
I know that. How do I know that?

361
00:15:44.615 --> 00:15:47.380
Because everybody
got the same rate,

362
00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:52.180
and that rate is calculated
off of treasury rates.

363
00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:53.770
All right, they follow a formula.

364
00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:57.655
They say, okay, when
the treasury sold

365
00:15:57.655 --> 00:16:03.270
10-year securities in May,

366
00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:05.770
what was the yield at which

367
00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:08.055
they sold those
10-year treasuries, right?

368
00:16:08.055 --> 00:16:11.170
In May 2018, that yield
was three percent.

369
00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:12.990
Okay. So okay, three percent.

370
00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:14.945
We sold 10-year treasuries
at three percent.

371
00:16:14.945 --> 00:16:17.155
Okay, so what we're
going to do is,

372
00:16:17.155 --> 00:16:18.910
for the undergrad loans
we are going to add

373
00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:21.900
2.05 percent to that number.

374
00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:23.965
Now that's 5.05, right?

375
00:16:23.965 --> 00:16:25.490
And for the grad
students we are going

376
00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:27.120
to add 3.6 percent.

377
00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:28.510
So that's how they get to 6.6.

378
00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:30.795
So they calculated off
the treasury rates.

379
00:16:30.795 --> 00:16:32.360
Everybody gets the same rate.

380
00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:34.930
There's no risk-based pricing.

381
00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:36.060
They're not going to look
at you and say, well,

382
00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:36.930
I'm a little more worried about

383
00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:37.940
you than the other person,

384
00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:39.360
I'm going to charge you more.

385
00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:41.810
No, everyone pays the same rate.

386
00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:46.495
Okay. So once you're coming
out of grad's school,

387
00:16:46.495 --> 00:16:48.520
everyone borrowed at
the same rate but

388
00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:51.500
now they're clearly not
the same risk, right?

389
00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:55.329
Some people got juicy jobs
with great salaries,

390
00:16:55.329 --> 00:16:57.585
some people are still
having trouble,

391
00:16:57.585 --> 00:17:00.060
and lenders can look
at that and say,

392
00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:01.410
okay, this is interesting.

393
00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:03.310
We got everyone's paying
the same rate but some

394
00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:05.405
of these are clearly
better credits than others,

395
00:17:05.405 --> 00:17:09.250
and that is going to be

396
00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:13.865
the opportunity that the FinTechs

397
00:17:13.865 --> 00:17:15.630
are going to be kind
of feasting on here.

398
00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:19.730
So, okay. So just to summarize
so far, what have we said?

399
00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:20.895
Here we've said that number one,

400
00:17:20.895 --> 00:17:24.025
it's easy to slip into owing
money on your credit card.

401
00:17:24.025 --> 00:17:26.910
Right now, if you look back
at that graph is a little

402
00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:29.990
just under about a trillion
dollars of credit card debt,

403
00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:31.875
and those people are very often

404
00:17:31.875 --> 00:17:34.675
looking for ways to
refinance out of it.

405
00:17:34.675 --> 00:17:37.085
You could do
the home-equity line,

406
00:17:37.085 --> 00:17:38.585
but as we talked about that,

407
00:17:38.585 --> 00:17:41.025
that can be worrisome
to go that path.

408
00:17:41.025 --> 00:17:42.460
Now there's also a trillion and

409
00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:45.800
a half of student loan debt now.

410
00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:48.680
If you have a federal
student loan,

411
00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:53.190
you have access to
these income-driven repayment.

412
00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:57.275
On the downside, if things
don't work out so well,

413
00:17:57.275 --> 00:18:00.015
if things do work
out well, well now,

414
00:18:00.015 --> 00:18:04.920
you're paying the same
interest rate as anyone else,

415
00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:07.495
and maybe that's
an opportunity for

416
00:18:07.495 --> 00:18:10.755
a FinTech to come along and
offer you a different rate.

417
00:18:10.755 --> 00:18:14.080
So that's our summary,

418
00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:16.160
and in our next session
we'll talk about

419
00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:17.630
the evolution of

420
00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:20.570
peer-to-peer lending to
marketplace lending.
