WEBVTT

1
00:00:04.344 --> 00:00:10.482
Okay, well, so we saw that everybody
getting a federal grad-school loan for

2
00:00:10.482 --> 00:00:14.951
2018-19 got the same rate, which was 6.6%.

3
00:00:14.951 --> 00:00:20.159
Remember that was calculated off the
treasury rate, they added just one spread

4
00:00:20.159 --> 00:00:25.678
to that risk-free treasury rate where
that one spread of 3.6% over the treasury

5
00:00:25.678 --> 00:00:30.825
rate is supposed to reflect the average
risk of a grad school borrower, okay?

6
00:00:30.825 --> 00:00:35.920
And we also saw that students
who get into distress

7
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.423
have access to Income-driven repayment.

8
00:00:40.423 --> 00:00:46.129
And this has really,
really taken off in the past few years and

9
00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:51.834
is a big part of why we see
the student loan debt load increase so

10
00:00:51.834 --> 00:00:56.262
much to this gigantic
level that it has hit now.

11
00:00:56.262 --> 00:01:01.391
So, let's think about
the opportunity that this

12
00:01:01.391 --> 00:01:06.040
can present to a lender
entering this space.

13
00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.176
Okay, so, think about
the graduates who are doing better.

14
00:01:10.176 --> 00:01:15.947
We've already seen the graduates who have
hit a rough patch access income-driven

15
00:01:15.947 --> 00:01:21.056
payment but those that are doing better,
you've got the job you hoped for

16
00:01:21.056 --> 00:01:25.591
and you expect rightly or
wrongly that this is going to continue,

17
00:01:25.591 --> 00:01:30.208
you're going to have this high paying
job going forward from here and

18
00:01:30.208 --> 00:01:33.613
you'd like, so
now you're a low risk, right?

19
00:01:33.613 --> 00:01:36.986
Previously maybe you could
have been high or low but

20
00:01:36.986 --> 00:01:40.995
you know you're a low risk,
that's how you view yourself.

21
00:01:40.995 --> 00:01:45.629
So, a lender could come along to you and
say, well, okay,

22
00:01:45.629 --> 00:01:49.245
you're paying 6.6% on your loan, well,

23
00:01:49.245 --> 00:01:54.993
that represents an average risk level but
now we can see you're low risk so

24
00:01:54.993 --> 00:02:01.607
we're going to offer you something better,
how about 4%, how about 4%, right?

25
00:02:01.607 --> 00:02:05.898
So from the lender's point of view,
there are now 4 percent, well,

26
00:02:05.898 --> 00:02:11.241
that's higher than 3%, so there's still of
a risk spread from their point of view.

27
00:02:11.241 --> 00:02:15.680
And maybe they view you as being low-risk
enough that they can make money loan to

28
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:16.420
you at 4%.

29
00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.567
And from your point of view,
great, you're paying 6.6,

30
00:02:20.567 --> 00:02:23.618
now you're paying 4, geez, let's do it.

31
00:02:23.618 --> 00:02:28.775
So, this had been, just that,
right there, that's been the main

32
00:02:28.775 --> 00:02:33.931
logic of the business model behind
the biggest player in the space,

33
00:02:33.931 --> 00:02:37.929
which is SoFi, short for
social finance,, SoFi.

34
00:02:37.929 --> 00:02:41.738
And SoFi is not the only player in
this space, you've got common bond,

35
00:02:41.738 --> 00:02:44.417
you've got some other
lenders in this space now.

36
00:02:44.417 --> 00:02:49.051
That was basically the business
model that all these borrowers

37
00:02:49.051 --> 00:02:52.997
are lumped into one pool and
all paying the same rate.

38
00:02:52.997 --> 00:02:56.606
Well, now especially that they
have finished their program,

39
00:02:56.606 --> 00:03:01.200
they've gotten jobs or they haven't,
we can see who the better risks are.

40
00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.715
Let's go in there,

41
00:03:02.715 --> 00:03:07.980
let's offer them to refinance them
out of these loans in a better way.

42
00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.823
So that's been the basic business model.

43
00:03:09.823 --> 00:03:15.819
Now you have to of course bear in mind
that from the borrower's point of view,

44
00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:21.260
as I've been sort of hinting at here,
there's a bit of a projection,

45
00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.979
a bit of a risk, a speculation on your
part when you do refinance into a SoFi

46
00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:33.750
loan because you are giving up your right
to enter income-driven repayment, right?

47
00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.760
That's a federal program, it's for
federal student loans, right?

48
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.390
If you're refinancing the SoFi,
then you got to find out, well,

49
00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.300
what are they offering me?

50
00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.978
If I hit a rock, anyone can hit
a rough patch for whatever reason,

51
00:03:47.978 --> 00:03:51.223
what are they offering
me in that situation?

52
00:03:51.223 --> 00:03:55.098
So that's the trade-off.

53
00:03:55.098 --> 00:03:59.181
Many people felt that,
well, it's worth it,

54
00:03:59.181 --> 00:04:03.875
I like that low interest rate,
I'm going to do that, and

55
00:04:03.875 --> 00:04:08.898
that's been driving the ramping
up of these businesses.

56
00:04:08.898 --> 00:04:13.979
Now let me add, by the way,
that this whole business of refinancing

57
00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:18.990
people out of their student loans
has kind of slowed down recently.

58
00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:20.339
Why would it slow down?

59
00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:24.130
Well, it slowed down
because rates have gone up,

60
00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.568
rates have gone up,
just the treasury rates have gone up.

61
00:04:28.568 --> 00:04:31.715
So, I put on the screen here, a Bloomberg,

62
00:04:31.715 --> 00:04:37.073
this is the screenshot from the Bloomberg
terminal, which is sort of the,

63
00:04:37.073 --> 00:04:42.006
for those of you not familiar with this,
this is the go-to financial

64
00:04:42.006 --> 00:04:46.965
information database that people
turn to in the financial markets.

65
00:04:46.965 --> 00:04:50.246
And Bloomberg, yes, it's the same
Bloomberg who was mayor of New York, and

66
00:04:50.246 --> 00:04:51.574
this is how he made that money.

67
00:04:51.574 --> 00:04:56.134
And so I went to that Bloomberg terminal,
I told it to show me

68
00:04:56.134 --> 00:05:01.348
the ten-year treasury rate over
the period going back some years.

69
00:05:01.348 --> 00:05:06.640
Just show me where the rates have gone.

70
00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:10.830
And you see that rates
came way down from 2006,

71
00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:14.639
which is where this graph starts, 2006.

72
00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:19.327
They came way down through the crisis and
stayed down in the year's post-crisis.

73
00:05:19.327 --> 00:05:23.409
But now in recent years they've
come up a little bit and

74
00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:26.460
they've come up a little bit.

75
00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:31.740
So, because they've come up,
the business model of these

76
00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:36.611
Fintech student lenders
has gotten tougher, right?

77
00:05:36.611 --> 00:05:42.363
Because if you took out a student loan,
let's say in 2016 the rates were really

78
00:05:42.363 --> 00:05:48.219
low, then that rate you got was keyed off
of the very low ten-year rate of 2016.

79
00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:53.162
Now, a few years down the road,
rates have gone up.

80
00:05:53.162 --> 00:05:56.040
So, even if you're paying a credit spread,

81
00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:00.205
which is in some sense too high
because you're a low risk, well,

82
00:06:00.205 --> 00:06:05.128
maybe the spread over the treasury rate
is too high, but you got that rate over

83
00:06:05.128 --> 00:06:09.646
a treasury rate, which is really low,
so now everything has come up.

84
00:06:09.646 --> 00:06:14.520
It may be hard for SoFi to offer you
something that's more attractive than

85
00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:19.565
your loan, which was keyed off of
a very low treasury rate back in 2016.

86
00:06:19.565 --> 00:06:23.344
So it's gotten harder for
them to make money this way,

87
00:06:23.344 --> 00:06:27.379
the offer to refinance people
out of their student loans.

88
00:06:27.379 --> 00:06:31.140
So if you look at these issuers,
SoFi and so on,

89
00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:35.939
what you'll notice is,
they're trying to transition away

90
00:06:35.939 --> 00:06:41.019
a little bit from that business
model of focusing on refinance,

91
00:06:41.019 --> 00:06:45.660
to being the lender that loans
to you in the first place.

92
00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:48.300
So that you never even take out
a federal loan in the first place,

93
00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:52.900
you just borrow from SoFi originally,
right?

94
00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:56.926
And of course now they're
making it a little harder on

95
00:06:56.926 --> 00:07:01.847
themselves because they're loaning
to you before you get a job or

96
00:07:01.847 --> 00:07:05.532
don't get a job and
sort of taking a bigger risk.

97
00:07:05.532 --> 00:07:07.984
But i think from their point of view,
well,

98
00:07:07.984 --> 00:07:12.356
this is a way that we can get around this
problem we have, which is that we're so

99
00:07:12.356 --> 00:07:16.466
dependent on what happens to interest
rates in the overall market between

100
00:07:16.466 --> 00:07:20.643
the time you take out your loan and
the time that you might want to refinance,

101
00:07:20.643 --> 00:07:24.790
we don't want to be so beholden to that,
so let's be the original lender.

102
00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:27.889
But of course, as we said,
if they're the original lender,

103
00:07:27.889 --> 00:07:30.578
you're never going to get
income-driven repayment.

104
00:07:30.578 --> 00:07:34.362
And so you're going to have to find it or
what are they going to offer you?

105
00:07:34.362 --> 00:07:39.241
What are they going to offer you to
smooth over the rough patches in your

106
00:07:39.241 --> 00:07:41.136
life going down the road?

107
00:07:41.136 --> 00:07:45.107
So, that's what we're
seeing now in this market,

108
00:07:45.107 --> 00:07:47.995
is it started off with refinancing but

109
00:07:47.995 --> 00:07:52.958
the path of interest rates have kind of,
has made that tougher and

110
00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:59.185
that's encouraged them to go further
upstream to the original origination, and

111
00:07:59.185 --> 00:08:04.961
it remains to be seen how well that goes
for them and how well that works out for

112
00:08:04.961 --> 00:08:09.204
the borrowers who are now sort
of depending on SoFi and so

113
00:08:09.204 --> 00:08:14.296
on to help them through the rough
patches versus the federal plan.

114
00:08:14.296 --> 00:08:15.309
Okay.

115
00:08:15.309 --> 00:08:20.689
So to summarize, lending to all
student borrowers at the same rate

116
00:08:20.689 --> 00:08:27.033
is going to create this opportunity down
the road for refinanced focus lenders

117
00:08:27.033 --> 00:08:32.048
to refinance those people who
turn out to be the better risks.

118
00:08:32.048 --> 00:08:37.109
There is this complication from
the borrowers' point of view that, yeah,

119
00:08:37.109 --> 00:08:42.725
I could do that, maybe it's a good idea,
maybe it's not, I really, it's hard for

120
00:08:42.725 --> 00:08:47.631
me to judge necessarily whether I
would take advantage of income-driven

121
00:08:47.631 --> 00:08:53.037
repayment down the road, and now I'm
giving that up by refinancing at the SoFi.

122
00:08:53.037 --> 00:08:56.895
For some people it's clear they, to them
that they'll never need it to others,

123
00:08:56.895 --> 00:08:57.984
it may be not so clear.

124
00:08:57.984 --> 00:09:03.117
And then the path that interest
rates have taken over the past few

125
00:09:03.117 --> 00:09:08.729
years have shown these lenders that
this is a risky business model.,

126
00:09:08.729 --> 00:09:13.198
it's too driven by the path
the interest rates take, so

127
00:09:13.198 --> 00:09:17.881
why not move further upstream and
be the original lender?

128
00:09:17.881 --> 00:09:21.022
And that's the business
they're getting into now, and

129
00:09:21.022 --> 00:09:23.121
we'll see if they can make that work.

130
00:09:23.121 --> 00:09:26.165
So that's what I want to say
about lending to consumers.

131
00:09:26.165 --> 00:09:31.094
The last point I want to make in the next
module is going to be a business model

132
00:09:31.094 --> 00:09:35.944
that has really taken off recently
where you have market place lending to

133
00:09:35.944 --> 00:09:37.311
small businesses.
