1
00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:06.525
So what is Robo-advising?

2
00:00:06.525 --> 00:00:08.280
Well, it's as it sounds like,

3
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.655
it's basically a robot
that gives you advice.

4
00:00:11.655 --> 00:00:13.590
It's an app that takes

5
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.435
the place of a human
financial advisor.

6
00:00:18.435 --> 00:00:23.010
As such, it can handle
the logistics of

7
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.240
your finances like show

8
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.150
you all your accounts
in your bank,

9
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.510
in your stocks, in
your mutual funds,

10
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.565
and it can show you
other things that you hold,

11
00:00:32.565 --> 00:00:34.740
it can present all your finances,

12
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.940
it can help you facilitate
transfers between accounts,

13
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.399
it can help you pay your bills,

14
00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.400
and deliver money elsewhere.

15
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.910
So a robo-advisor is

16
00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.340
a logistical help-mate that
you'd have on your phone.

17
00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.555
That's all true
and that's useful.

18
00:00:53.555 --> 00:00:57.830
But really think about
what robo-advising is

19
00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:59.315
doing for you that's

20
00:00:59.315 --> 00:01:02.150
adding significant
value to your life.

21
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.295
It's not really those logistics

22
00:01:04.295 --> 00:01:06.995
that are the main
source of value.

23
00:01:06.995 --> 00:01:10.440
As you see, the
real value added by

24
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.965
a robo-advisor is in

25
00:01:12.965 --> 00:01:15.760
helping you achieve
your financial goals,

26
00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.225
helping directing your savings to

27
00:01:19.225 --> 00:01:25.340
investment vehicles that are
appropriate for your goals.

28
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.220
So in this module,

29
00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.980
we're going to cover
the building blocks of

30
00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:32.540
robo-advising and it's going to

31
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.565
focus on this biggest piece here,

32
00:01:34.565 --> 00:01:41.359
how robo-advisors deliver
high impact investment advice

33
00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:43.640
and at a high volume to a lot

34
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.480
of people at once
and at low cost.

35
00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:51.105
So to understand how
robo-advising adds value,

36
00:01:51.105 --> 00:01:53.330
it's worth just rewinding

37
00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.425
a little bit back a few
decades to how it used to be.

38
00:01:57.425 --> 00:02:00.240
We think about how it used to be,

39
00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.125
rich people would have

40
00:02:03.125 --> 00:02:05.600
investment portfolios and they

41
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.390
would have investment advisors.

42
00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.639
So they'd be managing
this portfolio

43
00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:12.770
of their money for themselves,

44
00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.300
for their kids, for the long run,

45
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.670
for their retirement, and so on.

46
00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.605
Then, other people,

47
00:02:18.605 --> 00:02:20.990
they wouldn't have
financial advisors,

48
00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.210
they wouldn't even really

49
00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.710
be saving for their
retirement so much.

50
00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.900
Back in the day, when
I say back in the day,

51
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.595
I'm talking about
40 years ago, 50 years ago.

52
00:02:31.595 --> 00:02:34.340
If you showed up at your job,

53
00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.250
you wouldn't be signing

54
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.060
your 401k plan like you
did picking mutual funds.

55
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.920
Instead, you would
be told, "Well,

56
00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.095
here's how it's going to
happen for your retirement.

57
00:02:45.095 --> 00:02:46.680
Here's how it's going to happen."

58
00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.955
You have what we call a
defined benefit plan.

59
00:02:49.955 --> 00:02:51.845
When you reach retirement age,

60
00:02:51.845 --> 00:02:53.435
you're going to retire.

61
00:02:53.435 --> 00:02:55.370
At that point, we're
going to count

62
00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.310
up your years of service,

63
00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.855
we're going to multiply
by that number say

64
00:02:59.855 --> 00:03:02.810
two percent and then
we're going to take that,

65
00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.850
and we're going to
multiply that by something

66
00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.530
like the last salary you earned,

67
00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:08.660
something like that, your

68
00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.775
average salary over
the last years.

69
00:03:10.775 --> 00:03:12.620
Some formula like that.

70
00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.570
We're going to
calculate that formula,

71
00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:15.740
that's going to tell us

72
00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.260
an annual pension and

73
00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.930
then that's what
you're going to get.

74
00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.820
That's what you're going to get,

75
00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.930
you're going to stop working for

76
00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.670
your working wage
and now you're going

77
00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.740
to trigger into retirement.

78
00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:30.875
At this point, you're just
going to get that pension that

79
00:03:30.875 --> 00:03:34.960
is this defined formula
of the money you've made.

80
00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.990
So this is how it used to be.

81
00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:40.850
It's just 40-50 years
ago when you weren't

82
00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:42.980
thinking about how am I going

83
00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.345
to save for retirement
for the most part.

84
00:03:45.345 --> 00:03:46.770
Maybe you're worried a little bit

85
00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:48.000
but for the most part you're

86
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.715
thinking that's taken care of.

87
00:03:50.715 --> 00:03:52.965
I do what I do.

88
00:03:52.965 --> 00:03:56.060
If I'm making cars
or I'm teaching

89
00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.225
a class or I'm steel worker
whatever it is,

90
00:03:59.225 --> 00:04:00.515
I do my thing,

91
00:04:00.515 --> 00:04:01.880
I do my job,

92
00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.010
I try to do that well and

93
00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.440
then the whole
financial question of

94
00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.530
how is retirement
going to be paid for,

95
00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.510
that's being handled by

96
00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.300
financial professionals
off-screen.

97
00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.040
So that's how it was but

98
00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.970
you don't have to read
the news very far

99
00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:27.520
to see that benefit
came at a big cost.

100
00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.660
So it's not just magic

101
00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.430
that the money is going to be

102
00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.190
there when it's time to retire.

103
00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.700
In fact, the employer
has to stick

104
00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:45.145
to a schedule of making payments

105
00:04:45.145 --> 00:04:48.280
into a pension fund
and then has to

106
00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.910
see to it that that money
grows to the level

107
00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:53.980
that's needed so that

108
00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.995
the assets of the pension fund

109
00:04:56.995 --> 00:04:59.490
are sufficient for
the liabilities,

110
00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.480
the liabilities being
the pension payments

111
00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.150
that they have to make to
the people who've retired.

112
00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.410
As you can see, if you just read

113
00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:12.080
the paper offline
after this course,

114
00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.190
take a look at what's
happened around the country

115
00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:20.870
with pension plans
particularly municipal, state,

116
00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:25.430
and other government
pension plans where

117
00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.540
the money paid into
the plans really

118
00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:33.320
wasn't sufficient
to meet this goal.

119
00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.430
They were relying
on rates of return

120
00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:39.785
that they thought
they were going to

121
00:05:39.785 --> 00:05:41.030
make but then they didn't make

122
00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:42.320
them and when they
didn't make them,

123
00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:46.585
well the money just wasn't there.

124
00:05:46.585 --> 00:05:48.380
So this is going on right now.

125
00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:51.650
It's the biggest political
story in the country.

126
00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:52.985
Really when you get down to

127
00:05:52.985 --> 00:05:54.905
especially at the state level,

128
00:05:54.905 --> 00:05:56.130
it comes up every time,

129
00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:57.250
what are we going to do?

130
00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:58.490
What are we going to do about

131
00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:00.850
the solvency of
the pension plans?

132
00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:02.900
Look at what happened in Detroit.

133
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.940
If you worked for
the Detroit government

134
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.485
all those years and

135
00:06:06.485 --> 00:06:08.150
you're looking forward
to your pension,

136
00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.760
well, Detroit went in
and out of bankruptcy.

137
00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:12.110
Coming out of
bankruptcy, you're not

138
00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:14.285
getting quite what you thought
you were going to get.

139
00:06:14.285 --> 00:06:16.240
How about the auto workers?

140
00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.530
The auto workers at
GM and Chrysler.

141
00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:22.095
Once again, they had
to take a haircut,

142
00:06:22.095 --> 00:06:24.590
they had to take less than
they were supposed to

143
00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:27.965
get because the money
just wasn't there.

144
00:06:27.965 --> 00:06:29.560
Look at Puerto Rico.

145
00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.995
Look what's going
on in Puerto Rico.

146
00:06:31.995 --> 00:06:35.840
The enormous liabilities in

147
00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.180
Puerto Rico and
everyone is fighting

148
00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:41.960
over the assets and if you
are looking forward to

149
00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:46.785
a pension after a lifetime
of teaching in Puerto Rico,

150
00:06:46.785 --> 00:06:48.660
you should be worried.

151
00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:53.280
You should be worried,
the money just isn't there.

152
00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:58.975
So you have to,

153
00:06:58.975 --> 00:07:00.440
when you think about defined

154
00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.030
benefit plans,yes
it sounds great.

155
00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:07.770
In theory, if I'm an autoworker,

156
00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:09.030
I'm not a finance expert,

157
00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:10.630
I never said I was,

158
00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:12.590
I never wanted to
think about that.

159
00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:15.830
I wanted the employer to
take that off my hands.

160
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:21.450
But then that doesn't
have to work out.

161
00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:23.205
It doesn't have to work out.

162
00:07:23.205 --> 00:07:27.675
When it doesn't, it's not
even clear what you do.

163
00:07:27.675 --> 00:07:34.895
So these days, we were
transitioning out of

164
00:07:34.895 --> 00:07:38.210
those defined benefit plans

165
00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:40.700
into today's world of what

166
00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:43.340
we call defined
contribution plans.

167
00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:45.380
That's the distinction benefit

168
00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:47.360
versus contribution used to be.

169
00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:48.620
There was a promise there,

170
00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:51.020
you're going to
get this benefits.

171
00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:53.885
So it's what happens at
the end that's defined.

172
00:07:53.885 --> 00:07:55.730
These days, who knows

173
00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:57.030
what you're going to
have at the end there?

174
00:07:57.030 --> 00:07:59.525
What's defined as how much
you're putting into the plan?

175
00:07:59.525 --> 00:08:02.060
So for the most part,
for most of you,

176
00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:04.990
you're probably looking
at a 401k plan.

177
00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:08.930
401k plan, this is
where the tax code is

178
00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:12.935
encouraging this do it
yourself retirement savings.

179
00:08:12.935 --> 00:08:15.785
So think about my paycheck,

180
00:08:15.785 --> 00:08:18.230
your paycheck, at
the end of the month,

181
00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:21.230
money is taken out of
my paycheck and pre-tax,

182
00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:23.930
that's the tax encouraging this.

183
00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:25.685
It comes at pre-tax,

184
00:08:25.685 --> 00:08:30.425
goes into the mutual funds
that I chose for that money

185
00:08:30.425 --> 00:08:32.510
to go to and then

186
00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:35.870
my employer also pitches
in some money too.

187
00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:39.305
All that money goes
into the mutual funds

188
00:08:39.305 --> 00:08:43.970
and then hopefully it grows,
it doesn't have to grow.

189
00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:45.560
it didn't grow yesterday, okay,

190
00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:47.430
but hopefully it generally grows

191
00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:50.320
and then when I reach retirement,

192
00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:53.555
I've got my social security
but on top of that,

193
00:08:53.555 --> 00:08:56.730
wherever this ends up,
that's what I've got.

194
00:08:56.730 --> 00:09:00.045
So that do it yourself

195
00:09:00.045 --> 00:09:06.315
retirement savings is
just the way we live now.

196
00:09:06.315 --> 00:09:07.995
That's what's standard.

197
00:09:07.995 --> 00:09:11.965
So getting back to robo-advisors.

198
00:09:11.965 --> 00:09:14.360
If you think about where is

199
00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:18.290
the place that they're
really creating the value,

200
00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:25.130
that's really the oxygen
for this whole field,

201
00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:28.220
it's in helping people with

202
00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:33.210
these big financial decisions
they now have to make,

203
00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:35.220
they didn't use to have to
make them, but now you do.

204
00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:37.870
Now, do it yourself
retirement savings were

205
00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:40.670
just about everybody and these

206
00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:43.430
are people who don't
know any more than they

207
00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:46.625
used to about this field
that that's not their field.

208
00:09:46.625 --> 00:09:51.320
So it's crucial to
help these people save

209
00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:54.470
intelligently for retirement to

210
00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:56.480
help them come up with
an investment plan,

211
00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:58.700
help them stick to it,

212
00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:01.250
and also to show them

213
00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:04.870
the range of outcomes
that they can expect.

214
00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:09.865
So that's going to be
the focus of this module here,

215
00:10:09.865 --> 00:10:14.530
to talk about how it is that

216
00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:19.280
these apps are
accomplishing this goal.

217
00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:23.510
How is it that they are coming
up with the advice that

218
00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:27.810
they are providing
to their clients,

219
00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:31.760
that is creating the book
of the value of these apps.

220
00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:34.010
What are the investment
products that

221
00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:36.040
the apps depend on and
how do those work,

222
00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:38.675
and then we can also talk
a little bit about how,

223
00:10:38.675 --> 00:10:42.050
with a big data approach,

224
00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:46.415
these robo-advisors can customize

225
00:10:46.415 --> 00:10:50.040
the advice they're
giving to the client.
