1
00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:07.035
So we saw that target date funds,

2
00:00:07.035 --> 00:00:09.570
which are the newest thing

3
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.430
and the hottest thing
in retirement

4
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:12.870
invest in these days are

5
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.840
a simple example of
customized investment,

6
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.580
customized to
just one thing, right?

7
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.400
How old are you or
how long it is,

8
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.560
how long do you expect it
to be until you retire.

9
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.060
Take that one fact,

10
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.430
and out of that,

11
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.110
create an investment plan.

12
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.150
Robo-Advisors obviously
can do better than that.

13
00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.540
They can find out much more
than just your age and they

14
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.720
can customize more
accurately than that.

15
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.400
We talked about how they could

16
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.200
gauge your risk
aversion by asking

17
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.675
targeted questions and and

18
00:00:44.675 --> 00:00:48.020
customize your portfolio to that.

19
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.420
Of course, there's plenty
other financial goals that you

20
00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.570
might have besides retirement.

21
00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.975
You may have the goal
of buying house?

22
00:00:55.975 --> 00:00:58.430
You want to have a goal of
buying a house and you want

23
00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.760
to save towards
that goal as well,

24
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.785
and so that's something that

25
00:01:03.785 --> 00:01:08.585
you can plan towards that
in a very similar fashion.

26
00:01:08.585 --> 00:01:11.065
Or maybe you already
have a house.

27
00:01:11.065 --> 00:01:13.150
Maybe you already own a house,

28
00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:22.770
and that is another source
of your wealth,

29
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.350
you're the equity in your house.

30
00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.850
Well, that's something that

31
00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.115
a Robo-Advisor can track for you.

32
00:01:29.115 --> 00:01:31.665
It's not that hard, right?

33
00:01:31.665 --> 00:01:36.005
If I know where your house is,

34
00:01:36.005 --> 00:01:40.420
I can go to one of
your Zillow or lots of

35
00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:46.045
other sites and grab an
appraisal that moves over time.

36
00:01:46.045 --> 00:01:47.590
It's going to move over time with

37
00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.290
other transactions in
your neighborhood,

38
00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.815
and I can report to
you what's happened to

39
00:01:54.815 --> 00:02:01.890
your home equity in
the past month or so.

40
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.760
You could think about
how to use that fact,

41
00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.535
how to use the fact that
you have that money.

42
00:02:06.535 --> 00:02:08.285
Do you want to take some of that

43
00:02:08.285 --> 00:02:11.540
out with a home equity loan?

44
00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.100
What's the rate in
the home equity loan?

45
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.280
Well, that's another thing
that Robo-Advisor can

46
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.500
present to you and maybe
make a suggestion.

47
00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.350
Or how about
your mortgage, right?

48
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.850
Should you be refinancing
your mortgage now?

49
00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.630
Is that an opportunity
these days?

50
00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.230
Is it worth it to refinance
your mortgage or pay it down?

51
00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.785
What about your student loan?

52
00:02:32.785 --> 00:02:35.255
You can refinance
your student loan.

53
00:02:35.255 --> 00:02:37.730
There are companies that
will help you with that.

54
00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.190
So phi that's their line of work,

55
00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.740
helping you refinance out
of your student loan,

56
00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:43.850
or maybe you don't want to

57
00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.455
refinance out of
your student loan.

58
00:02:45.455 --> 00:02:47.090
If you refinance out of

59
00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.725
your federal student loan

60
00:02:48.725 --> 00:02:52.360
into SoFi or something
else like that, well,

61
00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.360
now you're going to lose
your opportunity to enter income

62
00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.380
driven repayment in the future

63
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.150
if circumstances should change.

64
00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.430
You'll miss the opportunity to

65
00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.680
enter into this program
where your payment can be

66
00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.420
reduced to 10 percent of

67
00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.305
your disposable income
if bad times hit.

68
00:03:11.305 --> 00:03:13.710
Maybe is it, how do
you think about that?

69
00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:15.830
How do you think
about the lower rate

70
00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.550
from SoFi versus losing

71
00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.820
the opportunity to enter

72
00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.585
into income-driven repayment
in a bad circumstance?

73
00:03:26.585 --> 00:03:31.835
Those are tricky questions
on the debt side

74
00:03:31.835 --> 00:03:33.725
of your household balance sheet

75
00:03:33.725 --> 00:03:37.540
that Robo-Advisor can
help you think about.

76
00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.690
Also we talked about
just a few things that

77
00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.180
the Robo-Advisor can ask

78
00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.670
you and bring to bear
to your portfolio.

79
00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:47.750
There's all these other things

80
00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:48.830
that they don't have to ask,

81
00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.210
you they just have to watch you.

82
00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:59.070
If you have my app I can
see when you use it,

83
00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:03.740
I can see what kind
of events occur

84
00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:05.420
in the macro economy in

85
00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.765
the world that seem to
trigger you using it.

86
00:04:08.765 --> 00:04:11.015
I can see where you click.

87
00:04:11.015 --> 00:04:14.260
I can see where other people
are clicking right now.

88
00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.220
So, I'm learning a lot,

89
00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.000
you think you're just
looking at your app.

90
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.735
I'm learning about
you constantly.

91
00:04:22.735 --> 00:04:26.495
I can use that in ways
that could help you,

92
00:04:26.495 --> 00:04:29.000
or maybe you might think
it's not going to help you.

93
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.080
Maybe you think I'm going to

94
00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.280
take advantage of you somehow.

95
00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.290
Well, I'm not saying they won't,

96
00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:37.760
but that is all potentially
useful information

97
00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.140
that then I can potentially

98
00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:46.580
bring to bear on the offers
I send your way,

99
00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:50.525
the reminders I send to
you, suggestions I make.

100
00:04:50.525 --> 00:04:56.690
All of that can be key to
the behavior that I observe in

101
00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:59.674
you and the
contemporaneous behavior

102
00:04:59.674 --> 00:05:01.160
I can see in other people

103
00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.620
and the decisions that they make.

104
00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.570
So, there's a real
opportunity there

105
00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:08.720
real scope for big data

106
00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:15.540
approach to customizing
your Robo-Advising experience.

107
00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.035
I mentioned Social
Impact a bit back.

108
00:05:19.035 --> 00:05:20.450
This is, you think about

109
00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:23.820
the big trends in
investing these days.

110
00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:29.660
Index funds, there's
target date funds

111
00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:35.480
and the other big movement
these days is social impact,

112
00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:39.290
and this is another area where

113
00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:43.460
Robo-Advisors are
going to help you put

114
00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:48.450
to work whatever
ethical guidelines

115
00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:52.365
you want to bring to bear.

116
00:05:52.365 --> 00:05:55.590
So if there are certain
industries that you don't

117
00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:56.910
want to be involved in

118
00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:58.800
this sense of being
being a shareholder,

119
00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.975
well, that is something

120
00:06:00.975 --> 00:06:04.190
you can articulate
what your screens are.

121
00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:05.540
Don't put me in this industry.

122
00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:06.965
Do put me in that industry.

123
00:06:06.965 --> 00:06:08.315
Look for this behavior.

124
00:06:08.315 --> 00:06:09.830
Avoid that behavior.

125
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:14.960
This is all bread and butter
for the Robo-Advisor to

126
00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.675
easily pair down the universe

127
00:06:17.675 --> 00:06:20.300
of assets they optimize over,

128
00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:21.380
makes sure that this is

129
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.330
a universe that you
are comfortable with,

130
00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:24.470
and then put that to work.

131
00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:26.030
So that's another way that they

132
00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:29.740
can customize
your investing experience.
