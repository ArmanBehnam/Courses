1
00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.360
I mentioned a moment ago
that I'm a professor

2
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.850
here at the Wharton
School and it's

3
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.700
interesting to be a professor
of finance because a lot of

4
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.970
the founding fathers and

5
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.425
mothers of the field
are still with us.

6
00:00:19.425 --> 00:00:24.015
In fact, the original
founding father

7
00:00:24.015 --> 00:00:26.610
of the field is still with us.

8
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.575
His name is Harry Markowitz.

9
00:00:28.575 --> 00:00:30.990
He's in his 90s now and

10
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.090
he essentially invented
this whole field

11
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.840
of finance and
portfolio theory as

12
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.120
a graduate student in Chicago
back in the early fifties.

13
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.640
Then he won the Nobel Prize for

14
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.880
this work in 1990
and he still added.

15
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.935
I say if you go
Google Harry Markowitz

16
00:00:51.935 --> 00:00:54.380
you'll see he's still
working this area,

17
00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.575
he's working in this area
of Robo-Advising.

18
00:00:57.575 --> 00:01:00.920
So I want to talk
about what it is

19
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.450
that Dr. Markowitz did and how it

20
00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:09.575
is essentially what you will
find now under the hood

21
00:01:09.575 --> 00:01:15.245
of a robo-advising app
and his insights

22
00:01:15.245 --> 00:01:17.300
from the 50s are exactly

23
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.335
the insights we're
using today and you see

24
00:01:19.335 --> 00:01:23.510
they're all about
how if you want to

25
00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.149
invest for an expected return

26
00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:28.895
you're going to have
to bear some risk.

27
00:01:28.895 --> 00:01:31.565
You're going to have
to bear some risk.

28
00:01:31.565 --> 00:01:34.280
You'd like to do it without risk

29
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.795
but that's magical thinking.

30
00:01:36.795 --> 00:01:38.850
We are not doing
magical thinking.

31
00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.340
Now, Harry Potter doesn't have to

32
00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.340
worry about his retirement plan.

33
00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.555
But we do know magical thinking
for us and when you,

34
00:01:47.555 --> 00:01:49.670
so you're vesting for return,

35
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.515
you have to worry about

36
00:01:51.515 --> 00:01:54.230
how much risk you're taking
and what Dr. Markowitz

37
00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:58.065
showed was how to take

38
00:01:58.065 --> 00:02:00.950
the least risk for

39
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.670
the expected return
that you are targeting.

40
00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.960
That is the sort of

41
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.040
special sauce of what

42
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.710
robo advising is
bringing to the client.

43
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.775
Now that you're going to
get somewhere with no risk

44
00:02:16.775 --> 00:02:20.225
or even necessarily going to
get right where you want.

45
00:02:20.225 --> 00:02:22.100
Because that's
the essence of risk

46
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.500
that things can happen

47
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.360
and you're taking
a risk except that.

48
00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.210
But at least you can take

49
00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:34.150
the least risk necessary for
your expected return goals.

50
00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:41.295
So to understand what Dr.
Markowitz did back in the 50s,

51
00:02:41.295 --> 00:02:42.690
I need start with

52
00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.470
the fundamental precepts or

53
00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.130
axioms of economics especially,

54
00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.590
as they relate to investing.

55
00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.870
There's basically two precepts.

56
00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.490
I don't think you're going
to find two controversial.

57
00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.000
One of them is simply
that people always

58
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.900
prefer more to less.

59
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.225
I don't think I'm going
out on a limb there,

60
00:03:07.225 --> 00:03:09.140
that people prefer more to less.

61
00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.970
So you've got that people

62
00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.070
prefer more to less
and then the other one

63
00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:17.614
which is going to give us more
of the excitement is that,

64
00:03:17.614 --> 00:03:22.140
yes people prefer more
to less but they get

65
00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:27.714
decreasing amount of utility
out of the next dollar,

66
00:03:27.714 --> 00:03:29.290
the more wealthy they get.

67
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.750
So if you have a million bucks,

68
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.800
the enjoyment you get
out of another dollar,

69
00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.580
the million first dollar

70
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.910
isn't as much as if you
only had 1000 bucks.

71
00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.720
You have 1000 bucks
give another dollar,

72
00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.580
you get more enjoyment
out of that.

73
00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.770
So you always enjoy
another dollar but you enjoy

74
00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:49.930
that extra dollar at

75
00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.750
decreasing amount as
you have more and more.

76
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.340
So if you were to draw
a picture where on this axis is

77
00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.175
how much money you have

78
00:04:00.175 --> 00:04:03.130
and then on this axis
is how much utility,

79
00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.000
how much enjoyment you
get out of that money,

80
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.520
the line is going to go up
but it's going to go up at

81
00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.630
this decreasing rate and

82
00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.710
mathematician would say
it's a concave function.

83
00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:15.485
Those of you who took economics

84
00:04:15.485 --> 00:04:20.100
in college will
certainly remember that.

85
00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.095
This just picture
of utility curve

86
00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:24.135
which has this curve to it.

87
00:04:24.135 --> 00:04:27.060
It's curving down but it's
never going downwards.

88
00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.550
You've never have so much money

89
00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.905
of giving more
actually less happy.

90
00:04:31.905 --> 00:04:34.380
It's going up at
a decreasing rate.

91
00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.500
So just with those two,

92
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.805
I think not
controversial precepts,

93
00:04:41.805 --> 00:04:44.525
let's see what you
can get out of it.

94
00:04:44.525 --> 00:04:46.790
Well, the main thing
you get out of

95
00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.655
it for our purposes here,

96
00:04:49.655 --> 00:04:54.085
is that people are going
to be risk averse.

97
00:04:54.085 --> 00:04:58.270
By which I mean
that for generally

98
00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.700
speaking are not going to want to

99
00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.775
take a risk everything
else equal.

100
00:05:03.775 --> 00:05:05.995
So as a thought experiment,

101
00:05:05.995 --> 00:05:08.170
imagine someone offered you,

102
00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:10.240
"Hey, I'm given you a choice.

103
00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.695
You can just- I can
give you 1000 bucks,

104
00:05:13.695 --> 00:05:20.375
for sure 1000 bucks or
we can make it a gamble.

105
00:05:20.375 --> 00:05:23.060
So a gamble so that I flip

106
00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:24.850
the coin and if it comes up

107
00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:27.440
heads I'm going to
give you 2,000 bucks.

108
00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.195
But if it comes up
tails you get nothing."

109
00:05:30.195 --> 00:05:34.290
So it's the same expected value.

110
00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:36.140
Either way the
expected amount I'm

111
00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.420
giving you is a 1000 bucks.

112
00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:40.829
But with that gamble,

113
00:05:40.829 --> 00:05:43.935
it's either zero or 2,000.

114
00:05:43.935 --> 00:05:46.530
So if you're risk
averse you'd say,

115
00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:47.865
"Well, just give
me the 1000 bucks.

116
00:05:47.865 --> 00:05:48.980
I don't want to take
the gamble with

117
00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:52.910
the same expectation just
give me the 1000 bucks."

118
00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:55.890
You can see that's going to

119
00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:59.670
come straight out of
that utility curve,

120
00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:01.755
with that bend to it.

121
00:06:01.755 --> 00:06:05.645
You're going to want just a
1000 bucks and not the bet.

122
00:06:05.645 --> 00:06:08.675
Because for
the simple reason that

123
00:06:08.675 --> 00:06:11.490
you get more out of the first

124
00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:13.905
thousand than out of
the second thousand.

125
00:06:13.905 --> 00:06:15.870
because here is
a decreasing utility,

126
00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:18.200
more out of the first thousand
than the second thousand.

127
00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.500
So you're really not going
to want to take that bet

128
00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.390
to risk losing the first

129
00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:25.690
thousand for the chance of
getting the second thousand.

130
00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:27.705
You're not going to
want to do that.

131
00:06:27.705 --> 00:06:31.215
So we would call
that risk averse.

132
00:06:31.215 --> 00:06:33.740
By the way, we can
be even a little

133
00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:35.720
more precise about this and

134
00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.760
maybe we'll get back
to this when we talk

135
00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:41.150
later about how
robo-advisors customize.

136
00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:45.470
If I want to know how
risk averse you are,

137
00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:51.050
I can learn about that by
asking you questions like this.

138
00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:54.210
I could say, "So you don't- if

139
00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:57.870
between 1,000 bucks and
this gamble of zero,

140
00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:00.630
2,000 you want the 1,000.

141
00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:04.960
Well, what if it's not a
thousand What if it's 990?

142
00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:09.495
Do you want 990 more
than the zero or 2,000?

143
00:07:09.495 --> 00:07:10.830
You do have a 980.

144
00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:12.710
How about 970?" So
I could just sort

145
00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:15.455
of go down to the point
we say way, stop.

146
00:07:15.455 --> 00:07:17.480
You'd rather, you're happy.

147
00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:21.530
You're ambivalent between getting

148
00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:25.110
970 bucks or zero and 2,000.

149
00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:29.090
So there's essentially,
there's this difference there.

150
00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:33.980
This 970 what we would call
your certainty equivalent.

151
00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:36.455
That's an economist
would call it.

152
00:07:36.455 --> 00:07:38.720
So there's a three
percent discount

153
00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:40.600
from the 1,000 that it's actually

154
00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.400
worth and the 970 it's worth to

155
00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.695
you because of
your risk aversion.

156
00:07:44.695 --> 00:07:48.400
That three percent difference
is an important number.

157
00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:51.175
It tells me how risk
averse you are.

158
00:07:51.175 --> 00:07:54.220
If you'd said, Not 970 but 940.

159
00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:56.710
Then, that's more risk
averse and that's

160
00:07:56.710 --> 00:08:00.219
information that I can use

161
00:08:00.219 --> 00:08:07.440
to customize my portfolio
suggestion for you.

162
00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:10.630
[inaudible] I will give you
something that's a little less

163
00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:14.460
risky for your money if
you said 940 versus 970.

164
00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:16.240
So we can get back to that.

165
00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.905
So the key point for now,

166
00:08:17.905 --> 00:08:22.415
is that people are generally
going to be risk averse.

167
00:08:22.415 --> 00:08:26.065
So just following
up on that thought,

168
00:08:26.065 --> 00:08:28.460
when you think about choosing

169
00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:31.385
a portfolio for
risk averse people,

170
00:08:31.385 --> 00:08:37.380
then one thing you could say
right away is that, Well,

171
00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:41.465
everyone likes more
expected return

172
00:08:41.465 --> 00:08:44.510
but they want less risk.

173
00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:47.615
One way you can sort of
be more formal than say,

174
00:08:47.615 --> 00:08:51.300
"For a given expected return

175
00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:55.710
you would want to have
the lowest risk. "

176
00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:57.360
Or putting another way,

177
00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:59.790
"For a given risk you want to

178
00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:03.255
have the highest
expected return."

179
00:09:03.255 --> 00:09:08.210
That's going to be the challenge
for a robo-advising app.

180
00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:09.365
How do you think about that?

181
00:09:09.365 --> 00:09:10.640
How do you think about for

182
00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:13.655
a given expected return
what would be

183
00:09:13.655 --> 00:09:18.560
the lowest risk for which you
could achieve that and for

184
00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:20.540
a given risk what's

185
00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:23.390
the highest expected
return you can get?.

186
00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:25.095
So in our next lecture,

187
00:09:25.095 --> 00:09:28.000
we will look at how Dr. Markowitz

188
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.550
looked at this problem
of minimizing

189
00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:34.280
risk for expected return
and how it is

190
00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:36.470
that robo advisors are

191
00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:39.750
going to bring this to
bear for their clients.
