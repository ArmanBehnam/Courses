1
00:00:04.205 --> 00:00:05.359
All right, well,

2
00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:09.810
we talked about the hard way to
accomplish mean variance optimization.

3
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.010
And I promised you an easier way and

4
00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.760
here's the easier way,
it actually really couldn't be easier.

5
00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.490
The easy way to accomplish mean
variance optimization is to just take

6
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:27.490
the value-weighted market index to
be an efficient portfolio, okay?

7
00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:32.460
So take the value-weighted market index
such as the S&amp;P 500, that's pretty much

8
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.565
a value-weighted market index here in
the US, to be an efficient portfolio.

9
00:00:37.565 --> 00:00:43.196
Okay, now this might sound like
just throwing up your hands like,

10
00:00:43.196 --> 00:00:44.815
okay, forget it.

11
00:00:44.815 --> 00:00:47.910
I'm not going to try to optimize.

12
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.335
But actually there are some
good economic reasons to

13
00:00:53.335 --> 00:00:58.715
believe that a value-weighted market
index, the broader the index,

14
00:00:58.715 --> 00:01:06.130
the better is going to be at
least reasonably efficient, okay.

15
00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.510
And so let me just sort of
sketch what those reasons are.

16
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:14.290
Once again if you want to see more math,
it's easy to look it up.

17
00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:15.860
I'm just going to sketch it for you here.

18
00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:18.990
Here's one reason to believe that.

19
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.200
And this is that there's a long
academic literature on this point.

20
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.806
Reason number one is, if you have
two efficient portfolios, right?

21
00:01:28.806 --> 00:01:32.914
So there's two portfolios, each of which
has this nice property that it's got

22
00:01:32.914 --> 00:01:35.980
the minimum risk for its expected return.

23
00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:40.460
And then you combine those portfolios,

24
00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.550
the combined portfolio Is
also inefficient portfolio.

25
00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.700
Mathematically that works out, okay?

26
00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.380
So, if and I know it's a big if here, but

27
00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.090
if everybody in the world
holds an efficient portfolio,

28
00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:03.600
then everybody's portfolio put together
is an efficient portfolio, okay?

29
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.990
Well, everybody's portfolio put together

30
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.730
is essentially the value-weighted
market index, right?

31
00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:10.820
That's sort of what it is.

32
00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:17.840
It's just all of the assets put together
according to their sizes, right?

33
00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.680
So you put all that together.

34
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.950
Well, that is everyone's
portfolio put together.

35
00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.900
And so if everyone has a mean
variance efficient portfolio,

36
00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.700
then their sum is going to
be mean variance efficient.

37
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.490
I think that's sort of the idealized
way that economists talk.

38
00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.270
We know that in fact,
none of us, probably,

39
00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.798
really have a truly mean
variance efficient portfolio.

40
00:02:38.798 --> 00:02:43.653
So that's a bit of a stretch,
but as a thought experiment,

41
00:02:43.653 --> 00:02:45.712
it certainly works out.

42
00:02:45.712 --> 00:02:50.186
And then, another point they make, and

43
00:02:50.186 --> 00:02:57.698
this is often how it's presented
in a finance class here at Wharton.

44
00:02:57.698 --> 00:03:01.684
Which is that if, now here's another if,

45
00:03:01.684 --> 00:03:06.350
that's not as big an if
as the previous one.

46
00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:13.400
If everybody can borrow, or lend,
at the risk-free rate, all right?

47
00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.530
Everybody can borrow or
lend at the risk-free rate, more or less.

48
00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:23.032
Then you can show that,
ultimately, It's optimal for

49
00:03:23.032 --> 00:03:29.644
everybody to hold risky assets in
the same proportional weights and

50
00:03:29.644 --> 00:03:34.168
then just lever up or
down depending on how risk

51
00:03:34.168 --> 00:03:39.286
averse they are using the risk-free rate,
right?

52
00:03:39.286 --> 00:03:44.187
So if you're very risk averse then you'd
put a little bit in the risky assets and

53
00:03:44.187 --> 00:03:46.032
a lot in the risk-free rate.

54
00:03:46.032 --> 00:03:47.388
If you really want risk,

55
00:03:47.388 --> 00:03:51.792
then you're going to borrow a lot at the
risk-free rate, you're going to lever up.

56
00:03:51.792 --> 00:03:55.858
Borrow money at the risk-free rate and
then lever way up and

57
00:03:55.858 --> 00:03:59.180
put a huge amount of money
in the risky assets.

58
00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.810
But the point is that you can see
that it's optimal in fact for

59
00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.520
everyone to hold the same portfolio

60
00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:11.380
of risky assets in the same proportional
weights and then just lever up or down.

61
00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.230
Okay, once again,
this is something you can look up.

62
00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.630
I'm not going to try to prove that now,
it will take way too long.

63
00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.059
But for
our purposes the point is that, okay,

64
00:04:21.059 --> 00:04:25.611
if everyone's holding the same assets in
the same weights, then everyone's holding

65
00:04:25.611 --> 00:04:29.460
once again by that same logic,
the value-weighted market index.

66
00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.561
They're all holding
the value-weighted market index,

67
00:04:32.561 --> 00:04:36.950
just sort of in different amounts, but
it's always the same relative weights.

68
00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:41.888
Okay, so
the point is when I say take the valuated

69
00:04:41.888 --> 00:04:46.706
market index,
being an efficient portfolio,

70
00:04:46.706 --> 00:04:50.810
this is a position that's defensible.

71
00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:56.714
Both of the arguments I gave obviously
are approximate, because we know

72
00:04:56.714 --> 00:05:03.028
that they're not exactly true statements
about people and how they invest.

73
00:05:03.028 --> 00:05:06.393
But they're approximate, and

74
00:05:06.393 --> 00:05:11.882
economists learn to live
with close enough, okay?

75
00:05:11.882 --> 00:05:16.270
So we're not saying that
the value-weighted market

76
00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:21.050
index is going to be exactly
mean variance efficient, but

77
00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:26.820
you can argue that it could easily
be in the neighborhood of it, okay?

78
00:05:27.935 --> 00:05:32.180
So that's one reason to take

79
00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.610
the value-weighted market index
to be an efficient portfolio.

80
00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:41.900
Another reason, which is very
different reason, is that an index

81
00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:47.960
is generally going to be
much cheaper to trade,

82
00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:52.870
cheaper to trade then individual assets.

83
00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:59.950
Okay, now when I see this I'm thinking
of the work of another famous economist,

84
00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:05.470
his name is George Ackerlof, and
he is professor at Berkeley.

85
00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:08.490
And he wrote a very famous paper,
the 1970,

86
00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:11.610
for which he also won the Nobel Prize.

87
00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:15.239
And this is a paper he called
The Market for Lemons.

88
00:06:15.239 --> 00:06:18.726
So take a look at, it's one of the most
famous papers in all of economic, and

89
00:06:18.726 --> 00:06:20.104
it's written very clearly.

90
00:06:20.104 --> 00:06:25.048
And what he's saying very clearly
in that paper is that when you and

91
00:06:25.048 --> 00:06:30.436
I want to trade and you know that I
have private information about the thing

92
00:06:30.436 --> 00:06:35.576
that we're trading, that is going
to make you nervous, all right?

93
00:06:35.576 --> 00:06:39.192
And what he shows in the paper is that,

94
00:06:39.192 --> 00:06:43.940
he tells this in the context of used cars,
right?

95
00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:45.490
I've got a car, I drive it around.

96
00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:47.390
I know things about it, you don't.

97
00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:50.180
You know that I know things
that you don't know, right?

98
00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:55.244
And he shows how the market could
completely evaporate all due to

99
00:06:55.244 --> 00:07:00.701
the fact that you worry about whatever
price you might offer the car.

100
00:07:00.701 --> 00:07:06.280
You worry about what would it mean, if I
were to accept the price that you offered?

101
00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:09.411
What would that mean about what I
really know about the car, okay?

102
00:07:09.411 --> 00:07:11.657
So he's writing about cars, but

103
00:07:11.657 --> 00:07:15.437
people appreciated that this
point applies anywhere.

104
00:07:15.437 --> 00:07:19.999
It applies in any context where we're
trading something where one of us might

105
00:07:19.999 --> 00:07:22.115
have private information, okay?

106
00:07:22.115 --> 00:07:28.749
So just take Dr. Ackerlof's point and
think about it in the context now,

107
00:07:28.749 --> 00:07:35.305
of putting on a portfolio that
the robo-advisor has proposed, right?

108
00:07:35.305 --> 00:07:40.130
If the portfolio of individual stocks,
then every time you go to buy

109
00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:44.870
one of those individual stocks,
the person on the other

110
00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:49.220
side of the trade is going to wonder
why are you buying the stock.

111
00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:52.340
Might you know something
that I don't know.

112
00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:54.140
Maybe, maybe not, right?

113
00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:59.060
The person on the other
side has to defend against

114
00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:04.640
the possibility that you are trading
due to some private information.

115
00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:09.054
And therefore is going to
charge you a transactions cost.

116
00:08:09.054 --> 00:08:15.000
He's going to charge you what we call in
the profession, a bid ask spread, right?

117
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.620
If you're buying,

118
00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:23.090
he's going to charge you a price higher
than you would get if you sold, right?

119
00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:24.938
That's the bid ask spread, okay?

120
00:08:24.938 --> 00:08:27.606
So the point is that individual assets,

121
00:08:27.606 --> 00:08:32.473
especially the more obscure it gets,
like the smaller the company it is,

122
00:08:32.473 --> 00:08:37.910
the more the other side is going to
charge you just to trade the asset.

123
00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:46.150
Okay, so that's what it's like to try to
put on a position in individual assets.

124
00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:49.070
But what if you're
trading the whole index?

125
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:51.565
What if you're trading
the whole index at once, okay?

126
00:08:51.565 --> 00:08:55.087
I'm not buying each of
the 500 stocks in the S&amp;P,

127
00:08:55.087 --> 00:08:59.460
I'm just buying the S&amp;P
index from somebody else.

128
00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:03.920
Well, now that worry is
going to be far smaller.

129
00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:08.685
Okay, when I'm buying
the S&amp;P 500 index from you,

130
00:09:08.685 --> 00:09:11.780
you're probably worrying a lot less.

131
00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:16.230
What do I know about the whole
index that you don't know?

132
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:18.170
I might know something, right?

133
00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:22.430
I might know something, I might be
the chair of the Federal Reserve, and

134
00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:27.650
maybe I do know something that you
don't know the way the market's going.

135
00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:32.700
And actually here's a fun fact,
who is George Ackerlof married to?

136
00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:35.461
Janet Yellen, who was the chair
of the Federal Reserve, right?

137
00:09:35.461 --> 00:09:37.864
How's that for
a power couple there, right?

138
00:09:37.864 --> 00:09:42.895
So what George Ackerlof is
telling us about trading

139
00:09:42.895 --> 00:09:48.043
is try to trade in a way that
the other side can see that

140
00:09:48.043 --> 00:09:53.549
you're probably not trading
on private information.

141
00:09:53.549 --> 00:09:57.291
And you're going to get better
transactions costs, okay?

142
00:09:57.291 --> 00:10:02.804
So trade of the index
versus the individual

143
00:10:02.804 --> 00:10:08.630
assets is going to be
cheaper in the long run.

144
00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:12.190
You're not going to have money going
out the window from your portfolio in

145
00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:17.640
transactions cost if you're trading
the index versus trade individual stocks,

146
00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:22.010
like not nearly as much, okay?

147
00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:27.940
So you can have an optimizer that
optimizes over individual assets.

148
00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:34.610
Or you could just take the value-weighted
index to be your optimal portfolio.

149
00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:40.150
You can also take a middle road here,
kind of a hybrid approach,

150
00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:45.010
where your optimizer is optimizing
over individual assets.

151
00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:47.700
But the assets themselves
that it's optimizing

152
00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:52.090
over are index portfolios, okay?

153
00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:59.210
So the S&amp;P could be one of those
indices that goes into the optimizer.

154
00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:03.448
There could be the indices for
other countries, right?

155
00:11:03.448 --> 00:11:08.980
One for Canadian stocks, one for
Mexican stocks, one for Chinese stocks.

156
00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:12.090
And you could have
different asset classes.

157
00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:16.187
One for Internet stocks, one for

158
00:11:16.187 --> 00:11:20.435
energy, one for cars, and so on.

159
00:11:20.435 --> 00:11:25.723
So you have indexes that you're
optimizing over so that way maybe you can

160
00:11:25.723 --> 00:11:30.925
get what you feel is a little more
diversification benefit than you're

161
00:11:30.925 --> 00:11:35.970
getting from just buying
the value-weighted index of everything.

162
00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:42.373
But still when you're putting
