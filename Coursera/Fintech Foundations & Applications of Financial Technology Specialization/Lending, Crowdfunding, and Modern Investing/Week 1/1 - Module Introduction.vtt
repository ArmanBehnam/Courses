Hi, I'm David Musto,

2
00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.980
I'm a professor here
at the Wharton School.

3
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.620
I'm chair of the finance
department and also helping

4
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.710
to run our new Fintech Center
here at the school.

5
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.175
Today's module is going to
be about robo-advising.

6
00:00:17.175 --> 00:00:20.385
The goal of this module
is to give you

7
00:00:20.385 --> 00:00:23.205
sort of the helicopter view of

8
00:00:23.205 --> 00:00:26.505
what it is that
robo-advisors are doing.

9
00:00:26.505 --> 00:00:28.320
What will you see
if you look under

10
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.150
the hood of a robo-advisor?

11
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.285
How they add value
for the customer,

12
00:00:33.285 --> 00:00:36.345
and some of the ways
that they can maybe use

13
00:00:36.345 --> 00:00:38.115
a big data approach to

14
00:00:38.115 --> 00:00:42.550
improve the service they're
delivering to the customer.
