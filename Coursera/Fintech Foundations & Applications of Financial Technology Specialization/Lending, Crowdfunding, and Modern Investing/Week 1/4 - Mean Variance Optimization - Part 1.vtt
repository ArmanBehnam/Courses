1
00:00:04.205 --> 00:00:08.652
All right, so, let's follow this train
of thought to it's logical conclusion.

2
00:00:08.652 --> 00:00:13.771
All right, so
our goal here is fixed expected return,

3
00:00:13.771 --> 00:00:20.021
minimize risk, or fix risk and
maximize expected return, okay.

4
00:00:20.021 --> 00:00:24.514
So before we get into this, we kind of
have to define our term, okay so when I

5
00:00:24.514 --> 00:00:29.743
say expected return, remember, expected
return, it's a mathematical concept.

6
00:00:29.743 --> 00:00:32.954
It's a probability weighted average,

7
00:00:32.954 --> 00:00:37.772
right, if there's a half chance
of return of 3% chance and

8
00:00:37.772 --> 00:00:42.031
half of return 5% then
the expected return is 4%.

9
00:00:42.031 --> 00:00:46.116
Even though of course, we know 4% isn't
going to happen, it's going to be 3 or 5,

10
00:00:46.116 --> 00:00:49.514
but expect return is 4, so
that's what I mean by expected return.

11
00:00:49.514 --> 00:00:54.289
The mathematical concept of
a probability witted average, okay.

12
00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:58.896
For risk, there's different
ways you can measure risk,

13
00:00:58.896 --> 00:01:02.375
the way that Harry Markowitz
measured it and

14
00:01:02.375 --> 00:01:06.793
the way that people continue
to measure it to today, for

15
00:01:06.793 --> 00:01:12.360
the most part, is with the mathematical
concept of variance, okay?

16
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.132
Variance is a term of
art to a statistician,

17
00:01:18.132 --> 00:01:23.904
variance is the expected squared deviation

18
00:01:23.904 --> 00:01:29.835
of the outcome from its expectation, okay?

19
00:01:29.835 --> 00:01:35.558
So the variance, in our little example
there, right, it was three or five,

20
00:01:35.558 --> 00:01:40.595
so that variance would be defined
by three or five relative to four.

21
00:01:40.595 --> 00:01:44.595
If we had instead two or six,
all right, two or six, well,

22
00:01:44.595 --> 00:01:47.807
same expectation, larger variance, right?

23
00:01:47.807 --> 00:01:52.601
So it's the expected squared deviation

24
00:01:52.601 --> 00:01:57.113
from that expected return, okay, so

25
00:01:57.113 --> 00:02:01.914
that is a standard measurement of risk.

26
00:02:01.914 --> 00:02:05.860
I don't want to go deep into the math
here, you can sort of look it up on your

27
00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.918
own if you're curious, but
that's what variance is.

28
00:02:08.918 --> 00:02:13.641
And then, the other term you'll
often hear is not the variance, but

29
00:02:13.641 --> 00:02:15.927
the standard deviation, okay?

30
00:02:15.927 --> 00:02:18.068
And the standard deviation, well,

31
00:02:18.068 --> 00:02:21.805
that turns out to be just the square
root of the variance, okay?

32
00:02:21.805 --> 00:02:24.649
So, talking about variance,
standard deviation,

33
00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:27.185
you're talking about
the same basic concept.

34
00:02:27.185 --> 00:02:32.022
It's just that the standard deviation is
the square root of the variance, okay?

35
00:02:32.022 --> 00:02:35.401
So, bear in mind when I'm talking
about risk and expected return,

36
00:02:35.401 --> 00:02:37.316
that's what I'll be talking about.

37
00:02:37.316 --> 00:02:41.863
Risk is variance,
expected return is this probability

38
00:02:41.863 --> 00:02:46.130
weighted average of the possible outcomes,
okay?

39
00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:51.330
So for a given expected return, we're
going to want to minimize variance and

40
00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.633
for a given variance we're
going to maximize expected return.

41
00:02:55.633 --> 00:03:00.694
That's why people refer to this
whole sort of body of work on

42
00:03:00.694 --> 00:03:07.692
this topic as mean variance optimization,
mean variance optimization, okay.

43
00:03:07.692 --> 00:03:12.734
And the key terminology in this area

44
00:03:12.734 --> 00:03:17.786
is an efficient portfolio, okay?

45
00:03:17.786 --> 00:03:23.283
We're looking for efficient portfolios,
and when someone says efficient portfolio,

46
00:03:23.283 --> 00:03:28.498
that means also something very specific,
it means what we've been saying, okay.

47
00:03:28.498 --> 00:03:33.531
Efficient portfolio is
a portfolio with that

48
00:03:33.531 --> 00:03:39.095
nice property that of all
portfolios with the same

49
00:03:39.095 --> 00:03:44.398
expected return it has least variants,
okay.

50
00:03:44.398 --> 00:03:49.227
So it's the most appealing from this
point of view of all portfolios with that

51
00:03:49.227 --> 00:03:53.104
expected return, or
of course the other way around, right.

52
00:03:53.104 --> 00:04:00.956
For all portfolios with it's variants it
has the highest expected return, okay?

53
00:04:00.956 --> 00:04:04.462
So that's an efficient portfolio,
and you can see why people

54
00:04:04.462 --> 00:04:09.396
call it an efficient portfolio, because
you're efficiently bearing risk, right?

55
00:04:09.396 --> 00:04:14.226
You're bearing the risk that you just
absolutely has to be born if you

56
00:04:14.226 --> 00:04:17.069
want that expected return, all right?

57
00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:19.632
So that's an efficient portfolio,
by the way,

58
00:04:19.632 --> 00:04:23.397
let me just because we could get confused
at this point, so I want to be clear.

59
00:04:23.397 --> 00:04:29.306
There are two ways that the idea of
efficiency shows up all the time

60
00:04:29.306 --> 00:04:34.369
in financial economics and
they're not the same idea.

61
00:04:34.369 --> 00:04:37.851
So you have efficient portfolios,
okay, which is what I just said,

62
00:04:37.851 --> 00:04:41.034
you also have the concept of
an efficient market which I'm sure

63
00:04:41.034 --> 00:04:44.479
you've heard about over the years,
right our markets efficient.

64
00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:50.143
And when people say our markets efficient,
what they're saying is,

65
00:04:50.143 --> 00:04:53.793
do markets reflect available information?

66
00:04:53.793 --> 00:04:59.311
Okay, so another way,
is it possible to beat

67
00:04:59.311 --> 00:05:05.424
the market by trading on
available information?

68
00:05:05.424 --> 00:05:09.911
If it is, then you would say markets
are not efficient, all right,

69
00:05:09.911 --> 00:05:12.590
that there's information out there and

70
00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:17.860
that yeah you could use to beat
the market so they're not efficient.

71
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:22.455
That's a different idea, okay, that's
not something that we're going to be

72
00:05:22.455 --> 00:05:26.653
worrying about here in this module,
the concept of market efficiency.

73
00:05:26.653 --> 00:05:30.003
This is an important concept, but

74
00:05:30.003 --> 00:05:34.856
what we care about here
is portfolio efficiency,

75
00:05:34.856 --> 00:05:39.025
that is the brass ring
of the robo advisor.

76
00:05:39.025 --> 00:05:46.607
Okay, so what Dr.
Markowitz accomplished back in the 50s,

77
00:05:46.607 --> 00:05:52.042
and what people have
built on over the years,

78
00:05:52.042 --> 00:05:56.334
is he laid out how mathematically,

79
00:05:56.334 --> 00:06:02.077
you can identify these
efficient portfolios.

80
00:06:02.077 --> 00:06:07.378
Okay, now I'm not going to walk
through all the math here,

81
00:06:07.378 --> 00:06:10.581
that's sort of beyond the scope,

82
00:06:10.581 --> 00:06:15.898
the actual details of the math
would take us a week right?

83
00:06:15.898 --> 00:06:20.809
And we don't really have that kind of
time, so let me just tell you what

84
00:06:20.809 --> 00:06:26.574
the inputs are here to this, the inputs
that you need in order to accomplish this.

85
00:06:26.574 --> 00:06:30.701
And if you're curious about the actual
sort of what's the algorithm,

86
00:06:30.701 --> 00:06:35.050
then you can certainly go look that up,
it's everywhere on the Internet.

87
00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:40.281
But so let's just talk about the inputs
here, the inputs you're going to need

88
00:06:40.281 --> 00:06:45.999
to put into your sort of optimizer that's
going to run Dr. Markowitz's algorithm.

89
00:06:45.999 --> 00:06:50.767
Are going to be number one,
the expected returns of all

90
00:06:50.767 --> 00:06:55.018
of the individual assets
that you are optimizing

91
00:06:55.018 --> 00:06:59.802
over all the things that
might go into your portfolio.

92
00:06:59.802 --> 00:07:04.625
You need the expected return of all
those things that you might have in

93
00:07:04.625 --> 00:07:05.883
your portfolio.

94
00:07:05.883 --> 00:07:09.752
Okay, and then on top of that,
for the risk part,

95
00:07:09.752 --> 00:07:14.370
you're going to need the variants,
remember the same idea.

96
00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:18.001
The variants of each one of those assets,
and also and

97
00:07:18.001 --> 00:07:23.663
this is absolutely crucial to the whole
thing, what they call the co-variances.

98
00:07:23.663 --> 00:07:30.190
The co-variances are how much
these assets move with each other.

99
00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:36.140
Okay, how much they move with each
other and if you think about it, that

100
00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:42.796
is going to be crucial to risk reduction
through buying a lot of assets, right?

101
00:07:42.796 --> 00:07:48.197
If I have two assets and
they move opposite to each other, okay,

102
00:07:48.197 --> 00:07:54.212
then I'd rather have both of them at
once than just one of them, right?

103
00:07:54.212 --> 00:07:57.748
Because their risks are going to
cancel each other out somewhat.

104
00:07:57.748 --> 00:08:00.897
And even if they don't move
opposite to each other,

105
00:08:00.897 --> 00:08:04.994
as long as they don't move together,
holding a lot of them at once.

106
00:08:04.994 --> 00:08:10.509
Generally, those those individual
movements of the individual

107
00:08:10.509 --> 00:08:17.137
assets are going to have a tendency to
wash out, to wash out on average, okay?

108
00:08:17.137 --> 00:08:21.989
So those covariance,
the co-movements between the assets

109
00:08:21.989 --> 00:08:26.182
are going to be a crucial
input into this algorithm.

110
00:08:26.182 --> 00:08:31.040
So you have expected returns, and
then the variances of the assets,

111
00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:35.984
and also these co-variances that
tell you about how much these things

112
00:08:35.984 --> 00:08:38.276
are going to move with each other.

113
00:08:38.276 --> 00:08:43.023
Okay, so
as they say the actual math is a slog, but

114
00:08:43.023 --> 00:08:49.579
coming out of the other side of this
math is going to be a portfolio with

115
00:08:49.579 --> 00:08:55.820
a lot less risk than the individual
components that went into it.

116
00:08:55.820 --> 00:09:01.413
And it's one of those things that maybe
it's obvious once you think about it,

117
00:09:01.413 --> 00:09:06.497
but, wouldn't we all want to write
one of those papers have some result

118
00:09:06.497 --> 00:09:11.687
that no one had thought of and
then it's obvious once you think about it.

119
00:09:11.687 --> 00:09:14.624
That was an amazing accomplishment of Dr.

120
00:09:14.624 --> 00:09:19.203
Markowitz, and it is everywhere
in the world that he surveys now.

121
00:09:19.203 --> 00:09:25.290
So, if you think about
applying this concept

122
00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:30.417
of mean variance optimization, Dr.

123
00:09:30.417 --> 00:09:35.556
Markowitz's algorithm in your app.

124
00:09:35.556 --> 00:09:39.531
Let me just say there's a there's
sort of a hard way and easy way,

125
00:09:39.531 --> 00:09:43.725
I'll talk about the hard way,
the sketch right now, the hard way and

126
00:09:43.725 --> 00:09:47.540
then in our next lecture I'll
talk about the easy way, okay.

127
00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:52.186
So, the hard way is that
you take a stand on what

128
00:09:52.186 --> 00:09:56.952
the expected returns are of
all of the different

129
00:09:56.952 --> 00:10:01.976
assets you're putting
into your black box here.

130
00:10:01.976 --> 00:10:07.608
What the expected returns are and
all those variances and co-variances and

131
00:10:07.608 --> 00:10:12.804
you run the program, and
you calculate these efficient portfolios.

132
00:10:12.804 --> 00:10:18.794
But of course, I'm saying it's hard
not because it's hard to do the math,

133
00:10:18.794 --> 00:10:23.006
I'm saying it's hard because
what you get out of that

134
00:10:23.006 --> 00:10:28.178
optimization is only as accurate
as what you put into it, right?

135
00:10:28.178 --> 00:10:32.823
If you really don't know what
the expected returns are of

136
00:10:32.823 --> 00:10:38.063
the different assets that you
were putting into your black box.

137
00:10:38.063 --> 00:10:41.086
Then you're just totally guessing,

138
00:10:41.086 --> 00:10:45.908
then what the output is only going to
be as good as your guess is.

139
00:10:45.908 --> 00:10:50.374
Okay, and that can be the tough part,
right, you think about well,

140
00:10:50.374 --> 00:10:52.686
what might go into this portfolio?

141
00:10:52.686 --> 00:10:57.623
Well, maybe shares of Facebook,
maybe shares of Apple,

142
00:10:57.623 --> 00:11:04.598
maybe shares of Walmart, or Ford, or
maybe an IPO that just happened yesterday.

143
00:11:04.598 --> 00:11:11.477
Maybe stocks from other countries,
other sorts of assets, gold futures,

144
00:11:11.477 --> 00:11:18.155
oil futures all sorts of things could
go in to this optimization, right?

145
00:11:19.595 --> 00:11:24.663
And that can be tough to say what
was the expected return of Facebook

146
00:11:24.663 --> 00:11:30.382
versus the expected return of Apple,
versus the expected return of Ford?

147
00:11:30.382 --> 00:11:35.247
All right, that's not so easy, okay,
generally speaking it's going to be

148
00:11:35.247 --> 00:11:38.956
a lot easier for
you to say something intelligent about,

149
00:11:38.956 --> 00:11:43.220
not those expected returns,
but those co-movements, right.

150
00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:45.950
That's something that
you actually can say,

151
00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:48.611
you can think about with
a lot more accuracy.

152
00:11:48.611 --> 00:11:55.902
I can kind of understand how Facebook
moves with Apple or with Google.

153
00:11:55.902 --> 00:12:03.523
I can understand how Facebook might not
move so tightly with Walmart or with Ford.

154
00:12:03.523 --> 00:12:05.015
And I can go to the data,

155
00:12:05.015 --> 00:12:09.138
I can measure those co-movements
with a lot of accuracy, okay?

156
00:12:09.138 --> 00:12:14.612
So, When I go into this optimization,

157
00:12:14.612 --> 00:12:17.777
it's a little hard to say much
about the expected returns,

158
00:12:17.777 --> 00:12:20.920
it's a lot easier to say
things about this co-movement.

159
00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:23.955
So you might take an approach to say look,
okay,

160
00:12:23.955 --> 00:12:27.965
I don't want to put a bunch of
guesswork into this optimization.

161
00:12:27.965 --> 00:12:34.141
So I'm going to say look,
let's just say for argument's sake,

162
00:12:34.141 --> 00:12:39.887
expected returns are all the same,
but the co-movements.

163
00:12:39.887 --> 00:12:44.486
Those are the things that I'm going
to estimate from the data and

164
00:12:44.486 --> 00:12:49.777
put in the optimization and that is
going to give me my optimal portfolio.

165
00:12:49.777 --> 00:12:53.999
So what I'm saying here is that,
as as a theoretical construct Dr.

166
00:12:53.999 --> 00:12:58.074
Markowitz's algorithm is very
helpful when you get close to it,

167
00:12:58.074 --> 00:13:00.983
you have to start making
some judgment calls.

168
00:13:00.983 --> 00:13:06.255
And sometimes for some practitioners,
the easiest judgment calls is to say look,

169
00:13:06.255 --> 00:13:11.543
I'm not going to make sort of wild guesses
about expect returns of different stocks.

170
00:13:11.543 --> 00:13:18.638
But I do have lots of information
to use about their co-movements,

171
00:13:18.638 --> 00:13:24.115
and that's going to be
the workhorse of the investment

172
00:13:24.115 --> 00:13:28.236
advice I'm giving my clients, okay?

173
00:13:28.236 --> 00:13:31.012
So that's one of the hard way,
and then in the next lecture,

174
00:13:31.012 --> 00:13:32.543
we'll talk about he easier way.
