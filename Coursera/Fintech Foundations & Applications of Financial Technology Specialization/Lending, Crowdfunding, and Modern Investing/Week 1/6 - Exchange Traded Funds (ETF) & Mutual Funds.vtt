1
00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:06.410
Okay, so where are we now?

2
00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.950
So we have just been
through the logic of

3
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.590
mean-variance optimization
and we started with

4
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.070
the premise of decreasing
marginal utility,

5
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.930
and follow that all the way to

6
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.480
the concept of
efficient portfolios,

7
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.550
and talked about
how you can sort of

8
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.890
do this the hard way
or the easy way.

9
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.025
The hard way maybe
has more potential

10
00:00:29.025 --> 00:00:32.760
to deliver a lot of
diversification benefit,

11
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.470
optimizing over lots of assets

12
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.190
but your output is only
as good as your input,

13
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.110
and you have to
bear that in mind.

14
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.610
We talked about the easier
approach of let's just say

15
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.880
the valuated market index is

16
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.400
efficient and just
leave it at that,

17
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.600
and there's some actual
justification for taking

18
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.565
that point of view or

19
00:00:55.565 --> 00:00:58.475
we can take the point of
view that, well, okay,

20
00:00:58.475 --> 00:01:04.130
it's a good idea to be
trading indices because of

21
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:13.635
the problem of
information asymmetries.

22
00:01:13.635 --> 00:01:16.170
Private information of raising

23
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.930
transactions costs as
Dr. Sokoloff showed.

24
00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.780
So if we're going to optimize
over individual assets,

25
00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.765
why not have those
individual assets be

26
00:01:26.765 --> 00:01:31.090
indices and then just
optimize over those,

27
00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.145
so we can still keep our
transactions costs down.

28
00:01:34.145 --> 00:01:35.810
So that's where we are and

29
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.820
what I want to talk
about next is,

30
00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.080
what are this assets that
we can optimize over,

31
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:47.240
that allow us to diversify
across indices and basically,

32
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.990
there are two types

33
00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.160
of assets that I want
to talk about here.

34
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.440
Number one is going to be

35
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.860
your basic open-end mutual fund,

36
00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:58.910
let's call it mutual funds.

37
00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.140
You're going to say mutual
fund but what I mean

38
00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.550
is an open-ended mutual fund,

39
00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.205
which I'll define in a second.

40
00:02:03.205 --> 00:02:06.385
Think about Fidelity Magellan,
that kind of fund.

41
00:02:06.385 --> 00:02:10.160
The other is going to be an
exchange traded fund with

42
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.965
this assets that are
now called ETFs.

43
00:02:13.965 --> 00:02:16.120
ETF, exchange traded fund.

44
00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.185
So those are the two things
I want to talk about.

45
00:02:18.185 --> 00:02:25.130
Those really are the main
workhorses of the robo advisor.

46
00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:26.240
It's going to be where they're

47
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.320
going to be putting your money.

48
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:32.690
So let's talk about each of
these and see how they work,

49
00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.250
and how they're going to

50
00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:35.990
be appealing to the robo advisor.

51
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.420
So first, mutual funds.

52
00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.530
So your open-end
mutual fund has been

53
00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.860
around since the 1920s.

54
00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.140
It's a very simple idea.

55
00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.280
So if I have a mutual fund,

56
00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.360
then I'm managing money
and if you want to

57
00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.680
invest with me, well,

58
00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.050
you can give me 10,000

59
00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.930
bucks of your money to

60
00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.090
manage and then I would
take your 10,000 bucks,

61
00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.500
I would put it in the fund.

62
00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.000
So now my fund is
gotten bigger by

63
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.490
10,000 bucks and I got
to go put your money to

64
00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:12.395
work by buying more shares or
whatever it is I'm trading.

65
00:03:12.395 --> 00:03:15.140
What you get, you're
going to get shares of

66
00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.580
the fund and at what price
you're going get shares?

67
00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.300
Well, I'm going to calculate

68
00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.800
the per share value
of my mutual fund.

69
00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.140
So I value the whole portfolio

70
00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.150
that I'm holding of
all the different things,

71
00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.140
value it at the end of
the day and come up with

72
00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.020
a dollar figure divided
by the number of

73
00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.365
shares outstanding of the fund,

74
00:03:39.365 --> 00:03:43.100
and that ratio is the value
per share of the fund,

75
00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.345
and that's the price that
you're going to pay.

76
00:03:46.345 --> 00:03:51.860
So that's your classic
open-end mutual fund.

77
00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.875
People call it open-end
because your money is going

78
00:03:54.875 --> 00:03:56.810
right in the fund
or coming out of

79
00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.670
the fund later when
you want to get out.

80
00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.090
Your investment is directly

81
00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.675
making the fund
bigger or smaller.

82
00:04:03.675 --> 00:04:05.180
Now, the mutual funds have

83
00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.175
been around for a long time now

84
00:04:07.175 --> 00:04:12.960
but this industry has changed
tremendously over the past,

85
00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.830
let's say, over the past
40 years but especially,

86
00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:18.600
let's say, just in
the past 10 years.

87
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.385
I would say 10 or 15 years.

88
00:04:20.385 --> 00:04:22.700
This industry has changed the

89
00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.015
most and the change I
am talking about is

90
00:04:26.015 --> 00:04:29.375
a transition from a world of

91
00:04:29.375 --> 00:04:33.065
active management to a world
of passive management.

92
00:04:33.065 --> 00:04:34.520
So when I say active management,

93
00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:35.870
that's what it sounds like.

94
00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.180
You give me your money and I am

95
00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.730
going to actively manage it.

96
00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.900
I'm going to figure out which
stocks are undervalued.

97
00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.235
I'm going to buy those.

98
00:04:46.235 --> 00:04:48.530
If they're overvalued,
I'm going to sell them.

99
00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.670
I'm moving your money around
the different possibilities,

100
00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:55.010
based on my research,

101
00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.110
my diligence that
I'm doing and with

102
00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:00.500
the goal of giving you
an enhanced return.

103
00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.090
I'm going to beat the market

104
00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.415
with my analysis and
my trading skill.

105
00:05:08.415 --> 00:05:10.265
So that's active management.

106
00:05:10.265 --> 00:05:13.460
That was sort of
the whole world of

107
00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:14.780
mutual funds if you go back

108
00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.270
40 years but especially recently,

109
00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:19.580
people have been moving instead

110
00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:24.130
into index investment and
for two reasons really.

111
00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:27.215
Number one, the track record

112
00:05:27.215 --> 00:05:33.710
of active managers has
not been good on average.

113
00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:34.920
So in a given year,

114
00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.760
the fraction of
active managers that beat

115
00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.960
the market is below half.

116
00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.375
Most of them don't
beat the market.

117
00:05:43.375 --> 00:05:46.610
Part of this of course is
they charge pretty big fees.

118
00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:49.820
You might pay
one percent per year to

119
00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:53.360
your active manager
to make his trades.

120
00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.340
Whereas, if you invested with

121
00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:58.760
an index fund they would
charge you far less, right?

122
00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.670
You put your money
just an S&P 500 index fund,

123
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:03.395
you're not paying one,

124
00:06:03.395 --> 00:06:04.910
hoping not paying
one percent, right?

125
00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:06.620
I hope you're not because
you can get that for

126
00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:09.770
less than a tenth of a percent.

127
00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:12.305
That is, these index funds

128
00:06:12.305 --> 00:06:14.240
they're not doing
much labor here.

129
00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.830
They're not doing
a lot of research.

130
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:17.330
They're not doing all this work.

131
00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.070
They would otherwise
charge you for.

132
00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:21.500
They also not trading
very much, right?

133
00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:22.880
Because they're just
buying the index.

134
00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.370
So it's all going to

135
00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:28.580
be a lot cheaper and
people have been

136
00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:31.700
convinced by that logic
and money is moving from

137
00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:35.210
active management
into indexing, okay?

138
00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:38.330
One thing that means
is that these days in

139
00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:43.685
the mutual fund space you
have a lot of choice,

140
00:06:43.685 --> 00:06:46.610
there are a lot of different
index funds out there.

141
00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:49.130
So just not say, don't take
my word for it go take

142
00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:52.580
a look at all the
offerings at Vanguard,

143
00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:57.170
Fidelity, whatever mutual
fund family you like.

144
00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:58.910
Take a look, you'll see a lot of

145
00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:02.495
different choices of index
funds; country index funds,

146
00:07:02.495 --> 00:07:07.310
industry index funds, socially
responsible index funds,

147
00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:09.350
where they have a screen,

148
00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:11.540
so screening in or screening out.

149
00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:14.075
Certain kinds of stocks based

150
00:07:14.075 --> 00:07:21.065
on some sense of what is
more ethical then what else?

151
00:07:21.065 --> 00:07:24.740
Lots of index funds that you
can choose from these days.

152
00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:27.350
Okay. Now so that's your
open a mutual fund,

153
00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:28.490
but let me just make a couple of

154
00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:30.350
points here about
opening mutual funds,

155
00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:34.535
I'm going to contrast with
the ETFs in a second.

156
00:07:34.535 --> 00:07:36.020
Okay. Notice that,

157
00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:38.210
when you trade with
an open-end mutual fund,

158
00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:40.250
you're putting money
in the fund so

159
00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:43.640
your investment makes
the fund trade, okay?

160
00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:46.850
Now that can be some amount of

161
00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:48.575
drain on the fund

162
00:07:48.575 --> 00:07:50.900
that people go in and out
and going in and out,

163
00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:52.220
makes the fund trade

164
00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:53.840
because it has
transactions costs, right?

165
00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.175
So there's that.

166
00:07:55.175 --> 00:07:56.720
There's also another thing
which is that,

167
00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:58.775
if you want to invest
in an open-end fund,

168
00:07:58.775 --> 00:08:02.240
there's only one time
of day that they trade,

169
00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.290
which is the end of the day.

170
00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:05.495
So if in the middle
of the day say, "Hey,

171
00:08:05.495 --> 00:08:09.710
I think now's the time
to get in the market."

172
00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:12.064
Well, you can make
an order for shares,

173
00:08:12.064 --> 00:08:13.430
but you're not actually

174
00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:15.335
buying shares until
the end of the day.

175
00:08:15.335 --> 00:08:17.450
So whatever happens
in the market for

176
00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:19.520
the rest of the day you're
not getting, right?

177
00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:22.220
You're getting in at
the end of the day.

178
00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:23.765
So bear that in mind too.

179
00:08:23.765 --> 00:08:27.590
Also, a given fund family
is not necessarily going to

180
00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:31.490
be accessible from
just any trading platform.

181
00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:34.700
Okay. Trading platforms
can be sort of

182
00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:36.755
signed up with
certain fund families

183
00:08:36.755 --> 00:08:38.330
and not other fund families,

184
00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:40.970
so you want to put
money some fund, well,

185
00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:43.400
if your platform doesn't have it,

186
00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:45.560
well, then it's
going to be tough.

187
00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:46.700
Not impossible, because you can

188
00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:49.250
contact the fund family directly.

189
00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:51.020
Well, you can do it,

190
00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:52.985
but it's just a bigger hassle.

191
00:08:52.985 --> 00:08:55.700
Finally, a mutual fund

192
00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:58.310
is generally going to have
a minimum investment.

193
00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:00.365
You can't very often put just a

194
00:09:00.365 --> 00:09:04.220
$100 into an open-end fund.

195
00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:06.095
They tend to have a minimum of,

196
00:09:06.095 --> 00:09:08.120
at Vanguard I think their minimum

197
00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:10.265
is 3,000 bucks for anything.

198
00:09:10.265 --> 00:09:11.630
You've got to have 3,000 bucks,

199
00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:14.105
if don't you're not putting
money in one of their funds,

200
00:09:14.105 --> 00:09:17.435
okay, until you can accumulate
that much cash. All right.

201
00:09:17.435 --> 00:09:20.360
So that's the world
of open-end funds.

202
00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:23.450
Now let's think about ETFs,
Exchange-Traded Funds.

203
00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:26.885
Now, as the name indicates,

204
00:09:26.885 --> 00:09:32.480
these are funds whose shares
trade on the exchange, okay?

205
00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:34.040
So they trade on the exchange.

206
00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:38.970
That means, when you
buy shares of an ETF,

207
00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:42.695
you're not putting
money in the fund,

208
00:09:42.695 --> 00:09:44.600
you're just buying shares from

209
00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:47.225
somebody else who's
selling them, okay?

210
00:09:47.225 --> 00:09:50.840
Your money goes to the seller
and you get the shares,

211
00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:53.915
but the fund itself is
sitting there untouched.

212
00:09:53.915 --> 00:09:57.800
Okay. Your trade is
of no consequence,

213
00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:00.800
direct consequence
to the fund itself.

214
00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:05.315
Okay. So you're not
making the fund trade.

215
00:10:05.315 --> 00:10:07.190
Now bear in mind,
there is going to

216
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:09.860
potentially be a transactions
cost on the market.

217
00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:12.530
So maybe it's going to
cost you a penny a share,

218
00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:14.975
maybe a few pennies a
share to make this trade.

219
00:10:14.975 --> 00:10:17.900
So there's a transactions
cost on the market,

220
00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:22.200
but you're not making
the fund trade itself, okay?

221
00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:25.820
Also, another difference
from the open-end fund is,

222
00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:28.445
because these shares are
trading on the exchange,

223
00:10:28.445 --> 00:10:33.170
you can go in and out whenever
the market is open, right?

224
00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:36.275
You can go in or out
whenever the market is open.

225
00:10:36.275 --> 00:10:38.480
You don't have to just wait
to the end of the day, right?

226
00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:40.625
So if you think right now,

227
00:10:40.625 --> 00:10:44.540
I think I like what's
happening in the market,

228
00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:45.620
I like this news that came out,

229
00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:47.450
I think now is
the time for trade,

230
00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:48.860
I can go in right now,

231
00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:51.005
or if I get worried right
now I can get out right now.

232
00:10:51.005 --> 00:10:53.315
So you can trade
whenever you want.

233
00:10:53.315 --> 00:11:00.380
Also, you could in principle
just buy or sell one share.

234
00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:02.450
Now that's an odd thing
to do in the market.

235
00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:05.240
I just as sort of
it's possible, right?

236
00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:07.415
If the share cost 100 bucks,

237
00:11:07.415 --> 00:11:10.910
you could just buy one share
and invest a 100 bucks.

238
00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:12.980
That is a doable thing,

239
00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:16.160
what's not a doable thing,
the Vanguard,

240
00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.840
there you would just
simply need 3,000

241
00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.895
bucks or you just not
investing at all, okay?

242
00:11:19.895 --> 00:11:21.410
So there's there's no minimum.

243
00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:24.260
Okay. Furthermore, because
it's trading on the exchange,

244
00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.170
you can access it from
any brokerage account.

245
00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:28.340
Any brokerage account you can

246
00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:30.995
trade stock trade and exchange.

247
00:11:30.995 --> 00:11:32.390
There's no problem, if you have

248
00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:33.800
a brokerage account
you will be able to

249
00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:37.340
trade any ETF trading at the US.

250
00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:40.220
Okay. So if you take

251
00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:43.550
a look at what these
robo-advisors are going to do,

252
00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:46.250
they're going to
focus on the ETFs.

253
00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:48.395
They're going to focus on
the ETFs because you have

254
00:11:48.395 --> 00:11:53.640
a whole range of
ETFs to choose from.

255
00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:57.710
You can go in and out whenever.

256
00:11:57.710 --> 00:12:04.730
ETF fees are even lower
than the index funds.

257
00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:06.380
For the most part,
they're lower than

258
00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:10.250
the index funds offered
by open-end funds, right?

259
00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:11.750
Because ETFs it's actually

260
00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:13.340
a little cheaper to run an ETF,

261
00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:16.535
it's logistics of it are
cheaper than an actual fund,

262
00:12:16.535 --> 00:12:18.380
they can charge
slightly lower fees.

263
00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:21.545
So the robo-advisors
optimizing over,

264
00:12:21.545 --> 00:12:25.080
for the most part, these is ETFs.

265
00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:29.150
Because the ETF fees
are so low, right?

266
00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:31.100
If you invested the robo-advisor,

267
00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:33.200
you are paying fees
on fees, right?

268
00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:35.780
You're paying fee to the
robo-advisor and you're

269
00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:38.725
paying a fee for the investment
that they put you in.

270
00:12:38.725 --> 00:12:40.520
But the fees on
the investments they

271
00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:42.290
put you in a really low, okay?

272
00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:46.055
So even you add
those two things together,

273
00:12:46.055 --> 00:12:52.010
you're not talking about
a lot much per year.

274
00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:53.330
You're not talking
about, for example,

275
00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:54.995
whole percent per year, right?

276
00:12:54.995 --> 00:12:58.145
Because both those fees
are pretty low, okay?

277
00:12:58.145 --> 00:13:01.640
There's just always more ETFs
coming out. All right.

278
00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:03.950
So if the robo-advisor

279
00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:05.060
wants to optimize over

280
00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:06.860
a wide range of
possibilities, well,

281
00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:12.020
there are about 200 new ETFs
rolled out every year,

282
00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:17.870
with just every possible
combination different sorts

283
00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:20.135
of indices that you
might want to aim for.

284
00:13:20.135 --> 00:13:27.770
So the robo-advisor can
sort of think at its level

285
00:13:27.770 --> 00:13:29.060
about how to allocate

286
00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:30.830
across these indices
and there's going to be

287
00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:35.615
an ETF there to make that work,

288
00:13:35.615 --> 00:13:37.295
to take that to the basket.

289
00:13:37.295 --> 00:13:39.680
So this is what you're
generally going

290
00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:41.960
to see in this space is that

291
00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:44.330
we're going to optimize with

292
00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:47.090
robo-advisor either you
take the valuate it

293
00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:49.085
indexes efficient approach or

294
00:13:49.085 --> 00:13:50.360
you take as other approach
you're going to

295
00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:54.290
optimize over indices and
if you look at ETFs space,

296
00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:55.985
there's an index for everything.

297
00:13:55.985 --> 00:13:58.980
So that's a feasible
thing to do too.
