1
00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:07.770
Robo-advisor doesn't
just pick a portfolio,

2
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.880
it picks the portfolio for you.

3
00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.210
It takes information
that you provide

4
00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.895
and turns it into
the right portfolio for you.

5
00:00:16.895 --> 00:00:20.049
Okay. We talked earlier about

6
00:00:20.049 --> 00:00:22.630
risk aversion and ways that

7
00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.030
you can measure risk aversion.

8
00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:27.130
You don't just have
to ask somebody,

9
00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:28.480
"Well, how risk averse are you?"

10
00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.930
You can ask them very targeted
questions that bring out

11
00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.570
their risk aversion in

12
00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.250
a way that's going to be
quantifiable and useful to you.

13
00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:40.705
Okay. So that's one thing.

14
00:00:40.705 --> 00:00:42.925
But another thing that's
probably going to be

15
00:00:42.925 --> 00:00:46.420
the most key
customizations they do,

16
00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.215
is going to be targeting,

17
00:00:49.215 --> 00:00:53.580
so where you are
on the life cycle.

18
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.120
Where are you now

19
00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.845
relative to when you
picture yourself retiring?

20
00:00:59.845 --> 00:01:02.360
Okay. So that's
going to be one of

21
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.540
the most important
customizations that they can do.

22
00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.370
There's going to be other things
too we can talk about,

23
00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.630
but this is going to be key here.

24
00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.030
Okay. Now, if you think about it,

25
00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.520
there's going to
be a real pattern

26
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.700
that you would expect in
life cycle investing.

27
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.180
Okay. These are the pattern
you would expect,

28
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.630
and this has been how
people thought about

29
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.810
life cycle investing forever

30
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.970
as long as people have been
saving for retirement,

31
00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.930
which is that more risk

32
00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.600
is more appropriate
when you're younger.

33
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.560
When your investment
horizon is far off,

34
00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.560
it's more appropriate to think
about taking a lot of risk

35
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.635
than when

36
00:01:50.635 --> 00:01:52.610
your investment horizon
is starting to approach,

37
00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:59.045
as retirement is starting
to be around the corner.

38
00:01:59.045 --> 00:02:03.260
So if you go back to
like the '50s or '60s,

39
00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.230
if you were going to
a financial advisor back then,

40
00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.420
there's a rule of thumb
that they love back then,

41
00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:09.410
and this was a standard thing

42
00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:10.955
they would say, "Well, look,

43
00:02:10.955 --> 00:02:14.660
you need to be adjusting

44
00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.580
your risk to where you are
relative to retirement.

45
00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.460
The rule was always,

46
00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:26.595
let's take your age in years,

47
00:02:26.595 --> 00:02:30.390
subtract that from 100

48
00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.810
and the result is going to be how

49
00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.000
much we put in equities.

50
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.860
So if you're 20,

51
00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.905
then we'll put
80 percent in equities.

52
00:02:39.905 --> 00:02:42.950
But once you're 60,

53
00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.320
it's only going to be
40 percent in equities.

54
00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.290
So just generally speaking,

55
00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.150
we are going to be taking down

56
00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.690
your equity exposure over
your life along that line."

57
00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:54.950
That was just a rule of

58
00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.175
thumb that people like
to follow back then.

59
00:02:57.175 --> 00:02:59.510
This is still pretty

60
00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.210
much the conventional wisdom
that people follow,

61
00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:06.769
that over time, if you're
investing for the long horizon,

62
00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:07.790
then you think "Well,

63
00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.605
I can put money in
something risky.

64
00:03:09.605 --> 00:03:11.390
Yes. It's risky. It's
going to go up and down,

65
00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.225
but over a long horizon,

66
00:03:13.225 --> 00:03:17.880
I should expect the ups
and downs to wash out."

67
00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.680
Okay. Now, I don't want

68
00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.240
to suggest to you that
you can count on that.

69
00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.650
If you think about
the defined benefit plans,

70
00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.745
we are talking about at
the top of this module,

71
00:03:31.745 --> 00:03:34.970
there's a lot of expectation

72
00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.900
there of risks evening
out over time,

73
00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.900
and it didn't quite
work out that way.

74
00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.090
They didn't even out nearly
as much as they'd hoped.

75
00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.550
So I don't want to
raise people's hopes

76
00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:49.150
too much that you
can count on that,

77
00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.290
but it's certainly more

78
00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.810
reliable at a longer horizon
than a shorter one.

79
00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.595
Okay. So in that long horizon,

80
00:03:55.595 --> 00:03:57.980
you ramp up the risk.

81
00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:03.060
As the horizon
shortens, you lower it.

82
00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.125
Okay. So this leads me to

83
00:04:06.125 --> 00:04:09.620
a product these days that
it's not robo-advising,

84
00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.890
but it's very popular and it

85
00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:17.260
gives you a sense of what
robo-advisors are doing.

86
00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.875
That is target date funds.

87
00:04:19.875 --> 00:04:24.395
Okay. Target date
funds are by far

88
00:04:24.395 --> 00:04:26.060
the most popular choice

89
00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.300
these days for
retirement savings.

90
00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.300
Okay. This is the basic idea

91
00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.340
the target date fund,
what are they doing?

92
00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.640
They're doing essentially
what I just said.

93
00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:46.500
So when you walk into
your job and they hand you,

94
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.495
they send you to
the website saying,

95
00:04:48.495 --> 00:04:50.490
"Okay, here are the choices.

96
00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.220
Click on these things,

97
00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.080
and click on the funds that

98
00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.880
you like and tell me
what percentage you want and

99
00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.500
which fund and that's where
your money is going to

100
00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.380
go once we start taking
out of your paycheck."

101
00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.090
The overwhelming
choice these days

102
00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.460
is the employee will say,

103
00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.955
"Okay, about when am
I going to retire?"

104
00:05:07.955 --> 00:05:11.809
If I'm right now starting
a job, right now,

105
00:05:11.809 --> 00:05:13.610
I might think, "I'm
probably going to

106
00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:17.960
retire something like 2065."

107
00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.670
All right. Something like that.

108
00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:22.070
So I would look and I say,

109
00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:25.645
"There is a 2065
target date fund."

110
00:05:25.645 --> 00:05:28.610
Okay. I'll just go with that,

111
00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:30.930
2065 target date fund.

112
00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:31.940
Just send all my money to

113
00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.955
the 2065 target date
fund, and that's it.

114
00:05:34.955 --> 00:05:36.800
That is a very,

115
00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.115
very popular choice these days.

116
00:05:39.115 --> 00:05:40.310
Just one and done.

117
00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:43.640
I just pick the 2065
fund and I'm all done.

118
00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.590
Now, what's going to happen
now that I chose that?

119
00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:49.685
Well, that fund is going to

120
00:05:49.685 --> 00:05:55.970
execute that life cycle
tilting that I just described.

121
00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:01.100
When you're way off from
retirement as you are now,

122
00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.410
it's going to put
you heavily into

123
00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:06.070
equities and a little
bit into bonds.

124
00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:08.070
Okay. Then over time,

125
00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:10.250
it's just going to follow a rule

126
00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:12.770
by which equity
investment goes down,

127
00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:15.470
bond investment goes up.

128
00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:17.045
Okay. Now, bear in mind,

129
00:06:17.045 --> 00:06:18.590
and we say target date,

130
00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:21.095
some people have gotten
confused with these funds.

131
00:06:21.095 --> 00:06:23.390
They think they hear
target and they

132
00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:26.285
think there's a target
amount at the end.

133
00:06:26.285 --> 00:06:27.830
If I invest in this,

134
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:31.790
I'm going to have enough money
to retire in 2065.

135
00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:33.650
That's not quite
what they're saying.

136
00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:35.165
They're targeting that date,

137
00:06:35.165 --> 00:06:38.705
they're following
a rebalancing rule

138
00:06:38.705 --> 00:06:42.200
that targets that date of 2065.

139
00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.580
But how much are you're
going to have then?

140
00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:45.740
That's really going to depend on

141
00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.105
what happens with the market.

142
00:06:47.105 --> 00:06:50.870
This confusion was a big deal

143
00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:53.135
back during the financial crisis.

144
00:06:53.135 --> 00:06:55.850
If you think about
in 2008 or 2009,

145
00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:59.855
market went way down and whatever

146
00:06:59.855 --> 00:07:04.450
your target date fund had
in equities at that time,

147
00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:08.740
well, they were exposed
to that return.

148
00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:10.250
If you were sitting
and thinking that

149
00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:11.780
there's a definite
amount of money

150
00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:13.400
that you're going to
get at retirement and

151
00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.110
now you see your bounce
go way down,

152
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:17.960
well, know there's not
a definite amount of money.

153
00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.030
They're following a rule,

154
00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:23.255
that rule is keyed
to your life cycle,

155
00:07:23.255 --> 00:07:26.420
but the market is still
going to do what it does,

156
00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:28.930
and you're still going to
be exposed to the risk.

157
00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:32.875
Okay. So to illustrate this,

158
00:07:32.875 --> 00:07:35.540
let me show you some numbers that

159
00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:38.845
I pulled off of
Vanguard's website.

160
00:07:38.845 --> 00:07:41.910
Okay. What I did was,

161
00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:46.005
they have a disclosure,

162
00:07:46.005 --> 00:07:51.045
which shows all of
their target date funds,

163
00:07:51.045 --> 00:07:55.595
and they show for each target
date fund how they have

164
00:07:55.595 --> 00:08:00.325
allocated the assets
of that fund.

165
00:08:00.325 --> 00:08:03.625
As you see on this screen here,

166
00:08:03.625 --> 00:08:07.720
you have target date
funds for 2065.

167
00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:10.565
That's the furthest out date

168
00:08:10.565 --> 00:08:13.490
that you can get targeted
fund for and then 20,

169
00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:14.945
then it's set every five years.

170
00:08:14.945 --> 00:08:17.165
So 2060, 2045, and so on,

171
00:08:17.165 --> 00:08:19.745
all the way down to 2015,

172
00:08:19.745 --> 00:08:21.680
which would be people who are

173
00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:25.880
just about to retire or
something like that.

174
00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:27.350
At this point, people who

175
00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:28.970
thought they were
going to retire in

176
00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:32.255
2015 back when they invested
in the fund earlier.

177
00:08:32.255 --> 00:08:35.280
Then they also have a fund
I've put at the very end here,

178
00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:36.740
which is the fund they have for

179
00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:38.630
people who are currently retired.

180
00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:42.130
Okay. So I've lined them all
up and color-coded them,

181
00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:43.595
so you can see

182
00:08:43.595 --> 00:08:47.585
the tilting of the assets
that I'm talking about.

183
00:08:47.585 --> 00:08:50.210
So in this chart here,

184
00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:54.050
you see the dark
blue at the bottom,

185
00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:56.135
that's their allocation to

186
00:08:56.135 --> 00:08:59.735
the valuated US equity portfolio.

187
00:08:59.735 --> 00:09:02.090
The orange is their allocation to

188
00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:05.245
evaluated international
equity portfolio.

189
00:09:05.245 --> 00:09:09.230
Okay. So the blue plus
the orange is essentially

190
00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:14.570
Vanguard's view of
the world market portfolio.

191
00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:19.560
You can see that if you're
invested 2065 funds.

192
00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:21.395
So your means you're
really young person,

193
00:09:21.395 --> 00:09:22.820
you're just starting your job,

194
00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:26.670
you're like 90 percent
percent in equities,

195
00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:29.730
and a little bit that 10
percent there in bonds.

196
00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:31.910
You see it basically
stays there for

197
00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:35.385
a while until you get to 2040.

198
00:09:35.385 --> 00:09:38.010
So about 25 years later,

199
00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:41.270
it starts to taper you

200
00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:44.960
off of the equities that
goes down every EC,

201
00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:48.140
every time as you go from
one fund to the next,

202
00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:49.790
representing people
who are closer

203
00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:50.900
and closer to retirement.

204
00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:52.385
As you go left to right here,

205
00:09:52.385 --> 00:09:54.770
you see that the allocation to

206
00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:57.680
that equity market portfolio
is going down,

207
00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:00.365
starts at 90, ends up
all the way at 30.

208
00:10:00.365 --> 00:10:01.690
So those even in retirement,

209
00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:03.725
they still got you in the
market a little bit there.

210
00:10:03.725 --> 00:10:06.335
Even in retirement, you're
still in the market sum,

211
00:10:06.335 --> 00:10:09.800
but you're deeply into
the fixed income,

212
00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:13.815
the bond portion, which is
the gray and the yellow.

213
00:10:13.815 --> 00:10:16.880
The light blue at the top
is basically cache.

214
00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:21.230
So you can see that life cycle
investing there.

215
00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:25.765
So there is a very simple
example of customizing

216
00:10:25.765 --> 00:10:31.850
your portfolio allocation to

217
00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:34.290
where you are in the life cycle.

218
00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:38.510
Let me point out
one more thing, which is that,

219
00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:40.720
what's Vanguard doing as they

220
00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:43.320
about efficient portfolios here,

221
00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:48.290
you're seeing that easy approach
they mentioned before.

222
00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:50.525
Remember I said,
the easiest way to think about

223
00:10:50.525 --> 00:10:52.730
mean-variance efficient
portfolios is

224
00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:55.005
that the market portfolio

225
00:10:55.005 --> 00:10:58.850
of evaluated index of
everything is more or

226
00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:02.670
less an efficient portfolio,

227
00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:04.850
and then you lever up and down

228
00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:07.700
your investment in
that market portfolio.

229
00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:09.740
Well, that's what
Vanguard is doing.

230
00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:10.805
If you look at that graph,

231
00:11:10.805 --> 00:11:12.395
that's exactly what
Vanguard is doing.

232
00:11:12.395 --> 00:11:15.740
Basically, this 60-40 mix of

233
00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:17.840
domestic versus
international stocks

234
00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.530
is the market portfolio.

235
00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:22.375
All they're doing
over time is just,

236
00:11:22.375 --> 00:11:27.470
you're investing more or less
in that market portfolio,

237
00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:30.620
and then putting the rest
essentially in something

238
00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:34.085
like other risk-free rate or
any case the bond return.

239
00:11:34.085 --> 00:11:40.830
So that is the essence
of robo-advising.

240
00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:46.320
They are a customized portfolio
that is taken to account,

241
00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:48.720
just one key factor,

242
00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:49.730
which is how close are you to

243
00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:51.440
retirement and coming up with

244
00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:57.430
a customized retirement plan
on that basis.
