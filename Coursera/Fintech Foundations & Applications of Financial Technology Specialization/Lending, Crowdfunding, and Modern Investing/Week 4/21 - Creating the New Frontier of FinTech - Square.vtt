00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.705
Hi, my name is Jackie Reses.

2
00:00:03.705 --> 00:00:06.510
I am the Capital lead of Square.

3
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:09.690
Square is a financial services
company that started with

4
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.370
payments and then evolved across

5
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.395
a broad ecosystem of products.

6
00:00:13.395 --> 00:00:17.220
The products can range
from point of sale,

7
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.680
both horizontal point of sale and

8
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:20.940
vertical points of sale that

9
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.980
could serve retailers
specifically,

10
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.020
or restaurants specifically, or

11
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.660
services companies that
take appointments.

12
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.060
Then, there's a breadth
of products that also

13
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.970
serves small businesses
like invoices,

14
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.170
loyalty cards, gift
cards, capital, payroll.

15
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.635
So it's really
this huge seller ecosystem

16
00:00:42.635 --> 00:00:45.595
to support the growth
of small businesses.

17
00:00:45.595 --> 00:00:46.910
In addition to that, there's

18
00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.055
a second ecosystem
that we've built

19
00:00:49.055 --> 00:00:53.285
and that's the ecosystem
around Square Cash App.

20
00:00:53.285 --> 00:00:56.630
For Cash App, there
is an ecosystem of

21
00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.320
over 15 million monthly
users who have used

22
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.550
the cash card and built

23
00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.520
cash accounts in
order to move money,

24
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:08.400
peer-to-peer payments,
use a debit card.

25
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.880
There's an incredible amount
of utility for

26
00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.315
consumers on that set
of products as well.

27
00:01:14.315 --> 00:01:16.220
There are three things
that I think are

28
00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.245
really interesting about Square.

29
00:01:18.245 --> 00:01:21.080
First, the ecosystem is

30
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.270
fascinating and it's

31
00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.925
the ecosystem around
financial services.

32
00:01:24.925 --> 00:01:27.350
Square started in
payments and then evolved

33
00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.470
the business far beyond into

34
00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.380
a breadth of products
that continue to create

35
00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.890
an ecosystem for small
businesses around the country.

36
00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.279
Second, it's an incredibly
disruptive company,

37
00:01:40.279 --> 00:01:42.785
and in every aspect
of the product,

38
00:01:42.785 --> 00:01:45.050
it has disrupted, and created,

39
00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:46.790
and invented a new way

40
00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.560
of thinking about
financial products,

41
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.720
which makes it
really interesting.

42
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.770
Then, third, Square sits at

43
00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.980
a really interesting place
as it relates to

44
00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.930
economic empowerment
and bringing the

45
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.335
underserved into
the financial system.

46
00:02:02.335 --> 00:02:04.995
If you think about
the creation of Square,

47
00:02:04.995 --> 00:02:07.310
which was the very
first white dongle

48
00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:08.730
and credit card reader,

49
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:10.730
the purpose of that product was

50
00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:12.920
not to read a credit card,

51
00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.690
it was to bring people into

52
00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.080
the financial system who might
not have been able to ever

53
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.970
take credit cards
in their business

54
00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.490
before because they're
able to now have

55
00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:27.500
an easy mobile device that
is simple to use and handy.

56
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.755
It meant more than just
the ability to take

57
00:02:30.755 --> 00:02:33.080
credit card for
so many small businesses

58
00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.625
when the company was started.

59
00:02:34.625 --> 00:02:36.630
So when Square was started,

60
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.960
it was trying to solve
the problem that

61
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.660
small businesses couldn't
take credit cards.

62
00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.490
What that actually meant

63
00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.980
is that they couldn't
make the sale.

64
00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.055
So, let me step back and
explain what that means.

65
00:02:49.055 --> 00:02:51.050
Ten years ago, there was

66
00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.360
no mobile payment system
for credit cards.

67
00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.550
Jack and Jim, the two founders of

68
00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.540
Square created a little white
dongle that's now somewhat

69
00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.880
iconic as being perceived

70
00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.350
as such a core design of Square.

71
00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.350
That dongle plugged into

72
00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.200
the headphone jack
of a mobile device.

73
00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.395
What that enabled a small
business to do was two things.

74
00:03:15.395 --> 00:03:18.995
First, they could take
the credit card, very simple.

75
00:03:18.995 --> 00:03:20.180
Within a few minutes,

76
00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.660
they were able to get up and
running and have access to

77
00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.760
the payment system very simply

78
00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.205
in a mobile device that
they might already own.

79
00:03:28.205 --> 00:03:31.310
The second thing it enabled
them to do was actually

80
00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:32.960
get into the financial system

81
00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.690
so that they could make the sale.

82
00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.290
Prior to Square, the way

83
00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.980
credit card companies worked
is that it took weeks of

84
00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:46.035
getting access to
a seller's personal data.

85
00:03:46.035 --> 00:03:48.620
In order to be given
a credit card account,

86
00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.245
they had to be
underwritten for risk.

87
00:03:51.245 --> 00:03:53.830
With Square, we really changed

88
00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:56.230
the paradigm of what
risk looks like

89
00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:57.920
so that a seller was able to

90
00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.840
be on-boarded onto the system

91
00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.480
immediately and only removed from

92
00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.700
the system if
anything looked off.

93
00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.545
So that was a total change
in risk behavior.

94
00:04:09.545 --> 00:04:13.070
Yeah, I think there are
four interesting dynamics

95
00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:16.245
happening in FinTech today.

96
00:04:16.245 --> 00:04:18.680
First, there's a disaggregation

97
00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.120
between the data and
the data source.

98
00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.530
So you're seeing
interesting businesses

99
00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.840
built around APIs that have

100
00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.585
really separated
the customer experience

101
00:04:29.585 --> 00:04:31.655
and the backend sources of data.

102
00:04:31.655 --> 00:04:34.070
I think that'll be
really interesting as

103
00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.410
different combinations
of data and

104
00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.630
end-user tools are pulled

105
00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.600
together to create
a great experience.

106
00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.675
Second, user-interface
so much cleaner.

107
00:04:45.675 --> 00:04:49.250
We're very used to financial
apps that are complicated,

108
00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.905
lots of words, hard to use.

109
00:04:51.905 --> 00:04:54.710
I think that is
completely changing with

110
00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:59.330
very simple apps that
consumers can easily use.

111
00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.970
Next and related
is really design.

112
00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.940
You're seeing a lot of
design first products.

113
00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.780
It's making a huge difference
in the ability to use them.

114
00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.550
I think they're getting a lot of

115
00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.240
consumer residents
across the country.

116
00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.545
Then, last, slightly
different topic,

117
00:05:15.545 --> 00:05:17.190
but the ideas around

118
00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.880
blockchain are having
a significant impact

119
00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.920
on the invention of

120
00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.455
infrastructure related
to the financial system.

121
00:05:24.455 --> 00:05:26.660
As we see transactions

122
00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:29.770
changing around the world and
evolving around the world,

123
00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.660
you'll start to see more
blockchain technology deployed

124
00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:34.145
across lots of different

125
00:05:34.145 --> 00:05:37.080
financial companies
around the world.

126
00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:40.370
I think business models and banks

127
00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:44.555
will have a significant
change over time.

128
00:05:44.555 --> 00:05:47.570
If you look at two of
the big core businesses today,

129
00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:49.804
wealth management and lending,

130
00:05:49.804 --> 00:05:51.305
both of them are seeing

131
00:05:51.305 --> 00:05:52.490
a significant amount of

132
00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:54.470
interest from fintechs
who are really

133
00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:59.585
disrupting the user experience
and the product flow

134
00:05:59.585 --> 00:06:01.220
of both of

135
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:05.960
those significantly impactful
industries within finance.

136
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.465
Over the course of 20 years,

137
00:06:08.465 --> 00:06:12.765
I would expect to
see models changing,

138
00:06:12.765 --> 00:06:16.040
the consumers having more power

139
00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.710
in how their product is used,

140
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:20.120
and having the products look more

141
00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.219
beautiful and easy to use,

142
00:06:22.219 --> 00:06:25.820
far more than they are
today where they still are

143
00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:29.540
incredibly cumbersome
in most cases.

144
00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:32.495
I think the one fundamental
issue that will remain

145
00:06:32.495 --> 00:06:34.085
within banking is that there's

146
00:06:34.085 --> 00:06:36.125
always going to be
a cost to capital.

147
00:06:36.125 --> 00:06:38.570
I think banks do

148
00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:41.150
have an edge around
regulatory compliance,

149
00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.280
the way they operate in terms of

150
00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.785
their scale and
the cost of capital.

151
00:06:46.785 --> 00:06:49.040
They're going to have to
work with that advantage

152
00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.995
to figure out how they
evolve over time.

153
00:06:51.995 --> 00:06:54.860
One of the biggest challenges
we're facing right

154
00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:58.205
now is related to privacy.

155
00:06:58.205 --> 00:07:00.380
There's a lot of
interest in looking at

156
00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:02.150
privacy law around the world.

157
00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:03.740
We've seen a lot of changes with

158
00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:07.225
the introduction
of GDPR in Europe.

159
00:07:07.225 --> 00:07:09.140
The challenge that
we're facing in

160
00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:10.730
the United States
is that there is

161
00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:12.350
a very significant interest in

162
00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:14.420
pursuing some type of

163
00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:18.605
legislation and regulatory
regime around privacy,

164
00:07:18.605 --> 00:07:20.420
yet it's being adopted and

165
00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:22.940
evaluated on
a state-by-state basis.

166
00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:24.640
It's hard to have

167
00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:27.470
national level products when

168
00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:30.725
you could have such variation
from state to state.

169
00:07:30.725 --> 00:07:32.780
I think the challenge is going to

170
00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:34.760
be how to deal with building

171
00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:38.660
legislation and momentum on
a national level so that we

172
00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:40.400
can create one regime that makes

173
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:43.025
sense for all of
the United States.

174
00:07:43.025 --> 00:07:45.320
I think there are
a few things that are

175
00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:47.975
really important and
understanding in fintech.

176
00:07:47.975 --> 00:07:51.455
First is the idea of
product development.

177
00:07:51.455 --> 00:07:54.694
It's a combination of
engineering and design

178
00:07:54.694 --> 00:07:58.780
and having an appreciation for
how the two work together.

179
00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:01.190
I think that's
absolutely critical for

180
00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:03.545
working in any company today.

181
00:08:03.545 --> 00:08:05.600
The second thing is understanding

182
00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.730
blockchain and cryptocurrency,

183
00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:11.165
and really delving
into understanding

184
00:08:11.165 --> 00:08:13.220
the infrastructure
and the impact that

185
00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:15.620
it could have on a company.

186
00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:19.370
Then, last, I think AI

187
00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:23.000
is going to change
almost every job out there.

188
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.995
So having an appreciation
for and learning about

189
00:08:27.995 --> 00:08:29.180
AI is going to be

190
00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:33.605
supercritical in
any financial education.

191
00:08:33.605 --> 00:08:37.010
I think one of the most
interesting things about

192
00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:40.035
fintech today is that no amount

193
00:08:40.035 --> 00:08:43.340
of historical skill base
will actually

194
00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:47.285
help you in creating
something that's disruptive.

195
00:08:47.285 --> 00:08:50.195
So it doesn't matter
what you did in school,

196
00:08:50.195 --> 00:08:51.560
where you worked right after

197
00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:55.150
school or how you think
about what you want to do.

198
00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:58.250
It's really about the creativity
and your willingness to

199
00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:01.055
invent in terms of

200
00:09:01.055 --> 00:09:04.430
whether someone is going to
be successful in fintech.

201
00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:07.970
Most of the models that we
see today are fairly new,

202
00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:13.850
and so having more of
a mindset around growth

203
00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:16.640
and a mindset around
invention is far

204
00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:20.610
more important than anything
else a person could have.
