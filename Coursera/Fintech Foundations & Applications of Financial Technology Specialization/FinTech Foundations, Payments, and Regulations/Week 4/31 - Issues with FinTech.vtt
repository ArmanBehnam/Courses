1
00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.450
Financial technology can solve

2
00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:05.070
a lot of problems that exist in

3
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:06.690
the financial sector with respect

4
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.655
to both consumers and firms.

5
00:00:08.655 --> 00:00:11.520
For example, it can help
those who don't have access

6
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.250
to the traditional
banking sector be

7
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.680
able to get access to
financial services at

8
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.100
lower costs than
expensive alternative providers,

9
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.875
and from the perspective of
entrepreneurs and firms,

10
00:00:22.875 --> 00:00:26.115
it can help new businesses

11
00:00:26.115 --> 00:00:28.170
who might not have
access to sources of

12
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.020
funding from traditional
financial institutions

13
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.550
be able to crowd fund

14
00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.800
at relatively low cost in order

15
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.395
to fund their new enterprises,

16
00:00:37.395 --> 00:00:39.170
but that's not to say
that there aren't

17
00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.660
also problems that
exist with respect to

18
00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.924
financial technology
service providers

19
00:00:43.924 --> 00:00:46.729
and new challenges for regulators

20
00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:49.040
as they think through how
best to intervene and to

21
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.535
help facilitate the growth
of these markets.

22
00:00:52.535 --> 00:00:54.830
The potential for a data breaches

23
00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:56.540
and cybercrime attacks is

24
00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:57.800
one area in which

25
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.025
financial technology fields
especially vulnerable.

26
00:01:01.025 --> 00:01:05.180
According to the FBI's
Internet crime report in 2017,

27
00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.710
cybercrime cost the US
almost $1.5 billion.

28
00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.040
As more consumer information
is stored on the

29
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.220
Cloud and more financial
technology is happening,

30
00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.520
and services are being
provided to consumers on

31
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.410
their personal electronic
devices like their smartphones,

32
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.115
concerns about cyber hacking
dominates significantly.

33
00:01:28.115 --> 00:01:30.020
As the technology innovators

34
00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.820
have at their disposal
to try to better

35
00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.345
the lives of consumers
improve significantly,

36
00:01:35.345 --> 00:01:37.250
so too does the technology that

37
00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.010
hackers and cyber criminals
can rely upon to

38
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.230
prey on consumers'
information and

39
00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:46.145
regular use of financial
technology innovations.

40
00:01:46.145 --> 00:01:47.840
One case study that's quite

41
00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.550
helpful to see the issues posed

42
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:50.930
by data breaches and

43
00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.420
potential cyber
criminality is of course,

44
00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.940
Equifax is recent exposure to

45
00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.500
hackers of its customer's
personal information.

46
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.150
Equifax technology
allows consumers to

47
00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.550
interface what
their credit scores online,

48
00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.460
and stores personal and
consumer information

49
00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.310
on its web-based
platform service.

50
00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.280
The enterprise technology
that Equifax relied upon

51
00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.380
how to vulnerability
which was identified

52
00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.690
months before the breach
but not fixed,

53
00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.140
and so hackers were able to
steal personal information of

54
00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.755
approximately half of
the United States population.

55
00:02:24.755 --> 00:02:27.170
That means that hackers
were able to get access to

56
00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.000
social security
numbers for around

57
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.805
a 143 million US citizens.

58
00:02:31.805 --> 00:02:33.590
The regulatory response to

59
00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.350
the Equifax data breach
was quite swift.

60
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.840
Senator Elizabeth
Warren co-sponsored

61
00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.280
a bill that would try and give

62
00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.730
the Federal Trade Commission

63
00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.730
more direct
supervisory power over

64
00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.290
credit reporting agencies like

65
00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.620
Equifax and the ability
to levy fines.

66
00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.590
The Equifax example
is the salient one,

67
00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.480
both because it's a very

68
00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.390
large data breach the
implicates around half of

69
00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.270
the population of the United
State and because it was

70
00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.150
relatively easily avoidable
data breach given that

71
00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.010
this vulnerability
was known but not

72
00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.295
fixed for months
leading up to the hack.

73
00:03:06.295 --> 00:03:07.910
However, this is far from

74
00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.050
the only instance of the
cyber criminality and

75
00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.750
fraudulent stealing of consumers

76
00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:15.950
personal information that is

77
00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.645
made available by financial
technology service providers.

78
00:03:19.645 --> 00:03:21.995
Large financial institutions are

79
00:03:21.995 --> 00:03:25.285
often the targets of
these Internet hacks,

80
00:03:25.285 --> 00:03:29.090
those like JP Morgan Chase
and eBay and T-Mobile,

81
00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.465
and online payment structures
like, Target and Apple,

82
00:03:32.465 --> 00:03:35.270
and there's a question
for how regulators

83
00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:38.375
should think about harnessing
the power of technology,

84
00:03:38.375 --> 00:03:40.400
and allowing for innovation in

85
00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.370
these new sectors while
simultaneously being

86
00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.490
cognizant of the fact
that protecting

87
00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:50.199
consumer information is
a difficult and important task,

88
00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:53.320
and so if consumers
transacted less online,

89
00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.340
there would certainly
be less ability and

90
00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.430
less concern that their personal
information could be so

91
00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.320
easily stolen by those with

92
00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.695
expertise in cyber criminality
but on the other hand,

93
00:04:03.695 --> 00:04:05.480
financial services
provision would be less

94
00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.625
efficient and less able to serve

95
00:04:07.625 --> 00:04:10.250
a large swath of
the population both

96
00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.640
here in the United States but
much more globally as well,

97
00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.700
and so the inherent
question here is how

98
00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.040
to weigh the benefits
of innovation and

99
00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.415
the benefit of broads
financial inclusion

100
00:04:22.415 --> 00:04:26.630
through financial technology
service providers against

101
00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.770
the nature of criminal threats
that will inevitably occur

102
00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.300
as more and more of

103
00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.395
our personal transacting
is happening online.

104
00:04:36.395 --> 00:04:41.930
The idea of data breaches
or cyber criminality while

105
00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.790
heightened in the context of

106
00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.850
financial technology are
not really new problems.

107
00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:48.425
It's always been a concern that

108
00:04:48.425 --> 00:04:50.195
individuals could get access to

109
00:04:50.195 --> 00:04:52.745
personal information
in ways that are

110
00:04:52.745 --> 00:04:56.065
undesirable and likely
to harm consumers,

111
00:04:56.065 --> 00:04:58.550
but financial technology
also creates

112
00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.620
a set of problems
that are really quite

113
00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:05.465
unique to these new
innovative platforms and pose

114
00:05:05.465 --> 00:05:07.010
a special confusion for

115
00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:08.990
regulators who have
yet to have to

116
00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.000
deal with the concerns that

117
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.160
are being implicated
in these markets.

118
00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.340
So for example, recently,

119
00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.810
cryptocurrency investors
were locked out of a

120
00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.260
$190 million after the founder of

121
00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.499
a particular Canadian exchange

122
00:05:23.499 --> 00:05:26.030
died prematurely without making

123
00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:28.655
provisions for
the future viability

124
00:05:28.655 --> 00:05:31.630
of this particular
cryptocurrency.

125
00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.940
Now, the main idea
of a crypto asset is

126
00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:36.740
its a de-centralized ledger to

127
00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.945
allow for anonymous transacting,

128
00:05:38.945 --> 00:05:42.185
and while this creates tremendous
benefits for consumers

129
00:05:42.185 --> 00:05:44.510
and makes financial
intermediation

130
00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:46.070
much more decentralize,

131
00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:47.510
it also creates quite unique

132
00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:48.950
problems that wouldn't occur,

133
00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:51.795
for example, if
Jamie Diamond passed away,

134
00:05:51.795 --> 00:05:53.880
the CEO of JP Morgan Chase,

135
00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.490
perhaps there will
be turbulence at

136
00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:57.080
the firm but the bank would

137
00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.545
roughly continued to function
as normal, and instead,

138
00:06:00.545 --> 00:06:03.080
the death of a cryptocurrency
exchange founder

139
00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.380
unexpectedly practically
means that large sums

140
00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.080
of money can
effectively disappear.

141
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.500
There would be no such
concern at a bank that

142
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:15.830
deposits of individuals
or of firms

143
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:19.370
would magically disappear
even if the founder of

144
00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:21.350
one of these large
financial institutions

145
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:24.055
was to pass away prematurely.

146
00:06:24.055 --> 00:06:27.395
Another divergent example

147
00:06:27.395 --> 00:06:29.705
involves peer-to-peer
lending schemes.

148
00:06:29.705 --> 00:06:31.775
The nature of
peer-to-peer lending

149
00:06:31.775 --> 00:06:33.890
is individuals apply for a loan

150
00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:35.930
and that loan is given to them

151
00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:38.180
by the peer-to-peer
lending platform,

152
00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.010
and then repackaged and sold

153
00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:42.410
to the other side of the platform

154
00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:44.690
which the nature of
peer-to-peer lending

155
00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:47.120
makes it sound like it's
another peer of yours,

156
00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.530
but in reality it tends to

157
00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:51.175
be large institutional investors,

158
00:06:51.175 --> 00:06:53.140
and in this particular context,

159
00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:54.725
the loans that were being resold

160
00:06:54.725 --> 00:06:56.915
didn't meet the buyer's criteria.

161
00:06:56.915 --> 00:07:00.230
The buyer in this case was
Jeffrey's bank but they were

162
00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:02.690
doctored by the peer-to-peer
lending platform

163
00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:04.385
to make it appear that they did,

164
00:07:04.385 --> 00:07:06.980
and this became
a cause for concern of

165
00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:09.890
the FTC in their context
of Lending Club,

166
00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:11.150
and eventually led to

167
00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:14.030
the resignation of
Lending Club CEO.

168
00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:16.490
One very interesting
case study that

169
00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:18.560
illustrates the unique
problems posed by

170
00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.050
financial technology has to do of

171
00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:24.410
course with Bitcoin and
particularly this Silk Road.

172
00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:27.950
The idea behind Bitcoin
is it allows for

173
00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:31.205
anonymous and fast transacting

174
00:07:31.205 --> 00:07:34.955
between consumers for
a variety of goods,

175
00:07:34.955 --> 00:07:38.195
essentially any kind of good
that you could conceive up.

176
00:07:38.195 --> 00:07:39.650
The anonymity is quite

177
00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:41.990
desirable to those who
value their privacy,

178
00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:43.610
and would prefer
that their exchange

179
00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:46.255
happen on a
de-centralized ledger.

180
00:07:46.255 --> 00:07:48.230
The concern though with

181
00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:50.690
such technology is that
it can be used for

182
00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:53.090
nefarious activities
as is the case with

183
00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:56.000
the Silk Road where
transactions would occur.

184
00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.130
For example, illegal drugs
on what is called the

185
00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:03.860
dark net through the use

186
00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:07.430
of Bitcoin and other
crypto assets.

187
00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:10.580
Estimate suggested
that around 70 percent

188
00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:12.560
of the transactions
that occurred on

189
00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:14.915
the so-called Silk Road involved

190
00:08:14.915 --> 00:08:17.810
illegal activities
such as drug trading.

191
00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:19.700
This suggest the need for

192
00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:20.960
more regulation and

193
00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:23.465
also more direct
intervention in this space,

194
00:08:23.465 --> 00:08:25.370
and points to the idea that it is

195
00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:27.950
important for us to
develop use cases or

196
00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:29.660
think through what the use cases

197
00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:31.820
for crypto assets maybe that

198
00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:34.040
simultaneously
improve the lives of

199
00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:36.800
consumers and allow us
to transact more easily,

200
00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:38.525
more quickly, more efficiently,

201
00:08:38.525 --> 00:08:41.255
but also preserve a role for

202
00:08:41.255 --> 00:08:45.110
and provide a venue for
appropriate regulation,

203
00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:48.500
and control over
activities that we may be

204
00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:50.720
concerned might happen outside of

205
00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:53.950
the traditional financial space.
