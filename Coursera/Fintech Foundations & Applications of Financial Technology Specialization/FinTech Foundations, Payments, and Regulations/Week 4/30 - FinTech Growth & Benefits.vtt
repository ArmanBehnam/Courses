1
00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:03.975
Since the global
financial crisis,

2
00:00:03.975 --> 00:00:05.880
financial technology
has emerged as

3
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.745
a leading industry for
innovation and growth.

4
00:00:08.745 --> 00:00:11.340
The number of financial
technology companies

5
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.055
founded annually has
grown significantly,

6
00:00:14.055 --> 00:00:21.210
from around a 178 in 2008
to around 700 in 2014.

7
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.370
By the year end 2016,

8
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:26.250
there were over 1000 firms
that classified themselves as

9
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.610
financial technology
firms operating globally.

10
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:31.110
The total investment in

11
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.360
financial technology
companies has

12
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.415
grown five-fold since 2014,

13
00:00:36.415 --> 00:00:39.050
from around 18.9 billion in

14
00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.035
2013 to around 110
billion in 2018.

15
00:00:44.035 --> 00:00:46.070
The number of investment
deals involving

16
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.050
financial technology
firms has more

17
00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.690
than doubled in
the last five years.

18
00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.890
Over a 100 billion dollars
of new investment money has

19
00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.560
flown into financial
technology firms

20
00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.935
since the financial crisis.

21
00:00:59.935 --> 00:01:02.179
An interesting way to understand

22
00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:04.595
the growth in
financial technology

23
00:01:04.595 --> 00:01:06.890
as an area for investment and

24
00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.170
also for consumer attention,

25
00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.580
is to leverage the power of

26
00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.120
technology to study
attention in this space.

27
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.130
So what we've done here is
we've looked at Google trends

28
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.555
for the search term
FinTech over time.

29
00:01:19.555 --> 00:01:22.670
What you'll see is there's
a significant uptake

30
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.185
in consumer attention around
financial technology firms,

31
00:01:28.185 --> 00:01:29.270
or firms relating to

32
00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.220
financial technology that has

33
00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.620
occurred in the last five years.

34
00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.599
As these trends illustrate,

35
00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:38.420
financial technology has
really become a hot space

36
00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.220
from consumer attention as

37
00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.425
well in investment perspective.

38
00:01:42.425 --> 00:01:45.375
Storied financial firms
like Goldman Sachs,

39
00:01:45.375 --> 00:01:47.930
individuals like
Warren Buffett are

40
00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.760
substantially investing in

41
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.895
the financial technology space.

42
00:01:51.895 --> 00:01:55.460
Emerging superpowers
like China and India,

43
00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.620
are leveraging
technology to improve

44
00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.450
the attractiveness
of their country

45
00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.660
for investment and
entrepreneurship.

46
00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.110
Trying to take an incredibly

47
00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.629
inclusive and innovative
stand towards

48
00:02:05.629 --> 00:02:07.760
new kinds of industries and

49
00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.070
new kinds of
disruptive technology,

50
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.810
in a way that makes the
regulatory burdens that exist

51
00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.150
here in the United States
and in other countries that

52
00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.015
have taken a less permissive
stand towards FinTech,

53
00:02:20.015 --> 00:02:22.400
less attractive countries from

54
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.915
the perspective of
entrepreneurs in these spaces.

55
00:02:25.915 --> 00:02:30.230
Developing countries those
like Latin America and Africa,

56
00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.450
are really hoping
to use the power of

57
00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.240
technology to be able
to provide more to

58
00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.510
their citizens and to better
serve consumers who have

59
00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.440
traditionally lacked access
to basic financial services.

60
00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.620
The real benefit of
financial technology is

61
00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.130
that it improves banking
access for consumers.

62
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.410
Mobile banking
allows consumers to

63
00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.420
interact with banks conveniently,

64
00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.055
for example those who live
far from traditional banks.

65
00:02:57.055 --> 00:03:01.070
Crowdfunding allows
entrepreneurs without access to

66
00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:05.345
conventional loans to fund
their new businesses,

67
00:03:05.345 --> 00:03:07.010
to be able to get funding for

68
00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.685
these businesses from
crowdsourcing investments.

69
00:03:11.685 --> 00:03:13.610
In the United States today,

70
00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.760
around 20 percent of
consumers are reportedly

71
00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.005
underbanked and around 7 percent

72
00:03:19.005 --> 00:03:21.525
of consumers are
entirely unbanked.

73
00:03:21.525 --> 00:03:24.145
This means that
unbanked consumers who have

74
00:03:24.145 --> 00:03:27.035
no access to the traditional
financial sector,

75
00:03:27.035 --> 00:03:29.630
and underbanked consumers
who may have access to

76
00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.310
the traditional financial sector

77
00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.140
but tend regularly to turn

78
00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.000
to expensive financial services

79
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.710
provider alternatives like

80
00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:40.525
payday lenders and check
cashing facilities.

81
00:03:40.525 --> 00:03:42.530
For these consumers,
a real benefit

82
00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:43.850
of FinTech is the ability

83
00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:47.195
to create a much more
inclusive financial sector.

84
00:03:47.195 --> 00:03:50.240
One that is able to best
serve and cheaply serve

85
00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.650
consumers in a secure
and efficient way.

86
00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.390
In the United States,
it's relatively rare in

87
00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.125
that only 7 percent of consumers
in the US are unbanked.

88
00:04:00.125 --> 00:04:01.550
These numbers are significantly

89
00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:03.410
higher in developing countries,

90
00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.240
where consumers
don't have access to

91
00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.820
traditional financial
service providers but

92
00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.490
incidentally often
do have smartphones.

93
00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:14.060
So being able to provide
more financial services to

94
00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.040
consumers through
the technologies

95
00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.305
that they already have access to,

96
00:04:18.305 --> 00:04:20.090
will be a way to
create a globally

97
00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:22.160
more inclusive financial sector,

98
00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.170
and to bring the efficiencies of

99
00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:26.930
technological innovation
to populations

100
00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.870
that need them the most.

101
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.675
Another real benefit of
financial technology providers,

102
00:04:32.675 --> 00:04:34.700
is that they bring
more efficiency

103
00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.185
to the financial sector.

104
00:04:36.185 --> 00:04:37.670
For example, there are financial

105
00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:39.800
technology innovators who through

106
00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.150
payment apps or remittance

107
00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.640
services or
crowdfunding platforms,

108
00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:44.870
have made it much easier,

109
00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.535
and faster, and cheaper,

110
00:04:46.535 --> 00:04:50.820
to be able to get access to
basic financial services.
