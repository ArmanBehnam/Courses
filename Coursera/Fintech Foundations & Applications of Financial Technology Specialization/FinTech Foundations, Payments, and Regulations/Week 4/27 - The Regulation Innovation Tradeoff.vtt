00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:04.350
In general, I like to
think about what I

2
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.260
call the regulation-innovation
trade-off.

3
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.810
So the key balancing act

4
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.360
will have to have in
our minds is that

5
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.419
innovation is good and
financial technology

6
00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:18.630
has the power to
serve consumers well,

7
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.060
and make the markets
function more

8
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.670
efficiently but on
the other hand,

9
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.230
we worry that as we've

10
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.110
regulated the financial sector
more aggressively,

11
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:29.850
there's a tendency to move

12
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.310
traditional activity outside of

13
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.010
the more regulated spaces and

14
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.670
into some of these less
regulated environments,

15
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.665
and so just to be quite
clear about this,

16
00:00:41.665 --> 00:00:43.340
I think that regulation can

17
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.770
ensure consumer safety and can

18
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.810
reduce the risks substantially

19
00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.825
of market crises
like the recession,

20
00:00:50.825 --> 00:00:53.630
and overall societal
pain that ensues

21
00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.135
from these black swan events.

22
00:00:57.135 --> 00:00:58.590
On the other hand

23
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.100
the regulation does
hinder the growth and

24
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.540
innovation by creating

25
00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.925
bureaucratic hurdles
to innovation,

26
00:01:04.925 --> 00:01:09.045
by creating bureaucratic
hurdles to advance.

27
00:01:09.045 --> 00:01:12.150
It may also as
George Stigler was worried,

28
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.530
benefit incumbent firms and

29
00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.090
tend to transfer risk in
the manner we've described

30
00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.160
from regulated areas
of the market

31
00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.370
to less regulated shadow sectors.

32
00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.850
Innovation helps companies
create new products in

33
00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.480
a safe and responsible way
that is going to best serve

34
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.970
consumers and allow
them to profit from

35
00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.385
this substantial
technological advances

36
00:01:34.385 --> 00:01:36.755
that have occurred
in recent eras.

37
00:01:36.755 --> 00:01:38.150
On the other hand though,

38
00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.415
there are real risks
of innovation.

39
00:01:40.415 --> 00:01:43.070
The fact that consumers
aren't particularly

40
00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.770
aware of the risks that
emerge in these markets,

41
00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.330
things like security and

42
00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.070
cyber crime risks that we'll get

43
00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.220
a chance to discuss here.

44
00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.440
It's interesting from
a conceptual perspective before

45
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.380
we dig deeply into
financial technology regulation

46
00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.960
specifically to think about
how we as consumers in

47
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.910
these markets tend to view

48
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.530
the desirability or the
usefulness of regulation broadly.

49
00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.660
This Gallup poll illustrates

50
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.820
that concerns about
regulation have actually

51
00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.090
risen since the early 1990s
about overly burden

52
00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.435
in some regulation
with consumers voicing

53
00:02:20.435 --> 00:02:22.910
distrust in government's
ability to best

54
00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.970
police these markets as
well as concerns that

55
00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.410
bureaucratic red tape can

56
00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.575
hinder significant
advancements that

57
00:02:30.575 --> 00:02:32.360
occur in other countries with

58
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.825
less stringent
regulatory frameworks.

59
00:02:35.825 --> 00:02:37.700
What's interesting
and important for

60
00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.620
us to keep in mind is that,

61
00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.349
regulation involves
the restriction

62
00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:44.285
of industries ability to engage

63
00:02:44.285 --> 00:02:46.265
in certain practices to

64
00:02:46.265 --> 00:02:49.415
hopefully best serve
consumers in these markets.

65
00:02:49.415 --> 00:02:50.840
Remember that this involves

66
00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.925
two different classes
of consumers.

67
00:02:52.925 --> 00:02:54.470
On the one side consumers who

68
00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.390
are consuming
particular products,

69
00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:57.950
on the other side those

70
00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.570
who work in the
industries that are

71
00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.590
being regulated who in
essence are also consumers.

72
00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.900
Regulation is meant
to help consumers by

73
00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.540
protecting them against risks

74
00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.825
that emerge in different markets,

75
00:03:10.825 --> 00:03:13.280
but regulation can also ill-serve

76
00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.340
consumers by making
certain markets less

77
00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.830
competitive and
providing incumbents or

78
00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.725
tremendous advantage
in those faces.

79
00:03:21.725 --> 00:03:23.180
This was of course the concern if

80
00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.015
George Stigler and one that
manifests itself today

81
00:03:26.015 --> 00:03:28.010
with respect to for example

82
00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.090
occupational licensing
in the United States.

83
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.770
The percentage of
occupations that require

84
00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:37.070
a state license in
order to participate

85
00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:38.625
in that occupation have

86
00:03:38.625 --> 00:03:41.100
increased from less than
five percent of workers in

87
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.555
the early 1950s to a quarter
of all workers in 2015.

88
00:03:45.555 --> 00:03:48.200
Jobs that require
such licenses range from

89
00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.200
jobs you would expect things
like physicians and lawyers,

90
00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.649
but also very intense
licensing requirements

91
00:03:54.649 --> 00:03:56.900
for occupations like barbers and

92
00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.090
manicurists and the expectation

93
00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.220
that they re-license
themselves with

94
00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.890
tremendous regularity
in order to remain

95
00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:08.215
licensed practitioners in
these particular occupations.

96
00:04:08.215 --> 00:04:11.120
The existence of
these licensing requirements

97
00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.820
does many things from
their perspective of consumers.

98
00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.260
On the one hand, it makes

99
00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.930
these occupations
more expensive to

100
00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:19.790
work in and as a result makes

101
00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:22.550
the prices that consumers
pay for their manicures,

102
00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.965
and for their haircuts higher

103
00:04:24.965 --> 00:04:27.815
but it also hurts
individuals who work

104
00:04:27.815 --> 00:04:29.900
in these occupations because it

105
00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.840
reduces worker mobility
and tends to increase

106
00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.960
inequality and provides
a stark barrier

107
00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.700
to entry for individuals who

108
00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.680
seek to participate in

109
00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.840
these particular industries as

110
00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.580
a way for career advancement.
