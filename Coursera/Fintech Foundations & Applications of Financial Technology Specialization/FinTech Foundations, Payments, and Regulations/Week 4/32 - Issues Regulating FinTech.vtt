1
00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:08.530
As we've discussed, FinTech is a broad and
really quite difficult to define industry.

2
00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.200
It covers banking,
credit cards, securities,

3
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.470
cryptocurrencies, lending,
investment advising, and much more.

4
00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:23.620
In regulating new technologies associated
even with these existing industries,

5
00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:27.290
often requires thinking about
a new framework for regulation and

6
00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:30.440
also who should bear
the responsibility for

7
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.630
supervising and
intervening in these particular markets.

8
00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.950
Another issue besides the breath with
which regulators have to think about

9
00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:45.100
a regulatory framework, involves the fact
that inherently we are thinking about

10
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.340
regulation in an industry and in a space
that is evolving incredibly rapidly.

11
00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:57.650
Alfred Kahn the Nobel laureate said this
with respect to regulation generally.

12
00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:03.595
That it almost was an inevitable game
of Whac-A-Mole, what is Whac-A-Mole?

13
00:01:03.595 --> 00:01:05.780
Well, for those of you who don't know,

14
00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.730
it is a fantastic arcade game where
a bunch of holes come out of a wall.

15
00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:14.556
And in essence you, the player, has a
mallet and when one of a mole comes out of

16
00:01:14.556 --> 00:01:18.955
one of these holes, you hit the mole
with the mallet as fast as you can.

17
00:01:18.955 --> 00:01:22.916
And then another mole comes out of another
hole and kind of the objective of this

18
00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:27.290
particular game is to hit as many moles
as you can in a certain period of time.

19
00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.220
Why is this a good analogy for
the regulatory space?

20
00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.170
Well, you worry that when you
restrict one particular kind of

21
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:42.100
practice of a financial institution or
a financial technology provider.

22
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.230
Then inevitably, another sort of very
similar practice is going to emerge and

23
00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:51.795
the regulator is kind of going to always
be playing catch up with respect industry.

24
00:01:51.795 --> 00:01:55.300
And that's especially true
with respect to FinTech,

25
00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.220
where the entire nature
of this industry involves

26
00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.150
leveraging new technologies in
innovative ways successfully.

27
00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.100
And so it's kind of inevitable
that regulators will be one step

28
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.920
behind the innovators and

29
00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.590
have difficulty figuring out how
best to supervise in this setting.

30
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.220
Alfred Kahn, of course, didn't think
that this was a reason not to regulate.

31
00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.660
He had a very clever analogy for what he
thinks of the role of a regulator that can

32
00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.620
help enlighten us with respect
to financial technologies.

33
00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.770
More broadly, his view for
regulation was that just as a sort of

34
00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.410
as industry is clever and there will
inevitably be holes in the dike,

35
00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.950
dike is like a container for
water let's say.

36
00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.740
The role of the regulator is to, as there
will always be holes that emerge in

37
00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.680
the dike, there will always be
new fingers that sprout for

38
00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.270
the regulator to sort of try and
restrict water from flowing out.

39
00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:55.286
And so the point is, that regulator have
to and the industry will always evolve and

40
00:02:55.286 --> 00:02:59.299
financial technology in particular
will always reform itself.

41
00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:04.146
And adjust to sort of work around
regulatory frameworks in ways that our

42
00:03:04.146 --> 00:03:06.825
profit maximizing for institutions.

43
00:03:06.825 --> 00:03:11.320
But what regulators must do is they must
be clever and thoughtful and adept and

44
00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.960
quick in responding to new risks
as they emerge in these markets.

45
00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.200
Another issue with respect to
financial regulation broadly and

46
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.980
financial technology regulation
specifically, is that we

47
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.670
are struck by the fact that these
markets are actually inherently global.

48
00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.000
And if there's no sort of global
coordination around regulatory framework,

49
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.750
this becomes quite difficult even for
countries which decide that it's

50
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:43.310
important to pay attention to risks as
they build up in these new sectors.

51
00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.803
So for example, if there is very strict
regulation of new financial technology

52
00:03:47.803 --> 00:03:50.150
service providers in the United States,

53
00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.921
which tends to be on one side of
the spectrum in these discussions.

54
00:03:53.921 --> 00:03:57.941
Then there's concern that first
innovation will gravitate outside of

55
00:03:57.941 --> 00:03:59.390
the United States.

56
00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:04.006
But second, the risks that build
up in other countries with

57
00:04:04.006 --> 00:04:08.716
respect to financial technologies
that the US doesn't have

58
00:04:08.716 --> 00:04:13.539
jurisdiction over may still harm
consumers in the US market.

59
00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:17.838
And so how do we deal with the fact
that risks are really global rather than

60
00:04:17.838 --> 00:04:19.825
national in financial markets.

61
00:04:20.835 --> 00:04:24.207
Here in the United States with
respect to financial regulation,

62
00:04:24.207 --> 00:04:26.660
a few points seem quite relevant.

63
00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:27.940
First as we've discussed,

64
00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.820
financial regulation encompasses
a broad swath of different industries.

65
00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.600
These industries are currently regulated
by distinct regulatory agencies

66
00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.100
with different mandates and
different standards for

67
00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:44.210
what they deem acceptable and
promoting of financial stability.

68
00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.660
I happened to work at the White House
in the aftermath of the crisis and

69
00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:55.510
as we were conceiving of the new post
crisis financial regulatory framework.

70
00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:59.810
What was hoped for and
conceived of as a massive

71
00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:04.740
innovation was to create a structure where
one particular regulator was kind of

72
00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:09.370
in charge of overseeing the entire
financial services industry.

73
00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:14.360
In reality, individual regulators still
maintain significant power over regulating

74
00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.240
their particular domains.

75
00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:20.550
And in many industries, participants
are required to meet the standards of

76
00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.519
a swath of different financial regulators.

77
00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:28.070
For example,
the SEC deals with investment advising,

78
00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:32.380
the Federal Reserve deals with retail
banking, and the consumer protection

79
00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:37.070
bureau is the consumer facing
arm of the regulatory framework.

80
00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:41.103
This means that sort of large financial
institutions are beholden into

81
00:05:41.103 --> 00:05:42.445
the Federal Reserve but

82
00:05:42.445 --> 00:05:46.826
also must meet the mandates of the Bureau
of Consumer Financial Protection.

83
00:05:49.102 --> 00:05:53.434
This creates a real question over
who is best suited to regulate

84
00:05:53.434 --> 00:05:57.010
financial technology service providers.

85
00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:00.940
Perhaps most naturally the answer to
this question depends on the nature of

86
00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.470
the financial technology
that we're thinking about.

87
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:06.410
For example, if it's Bank of
America's new mobile app that

88
00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:08.810
allows you to deposit
checks on your phone.

89
00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:12.400
Well, perhaps the Federal Reserve is
already regulating Bank of America and so

90
00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:13.250
it's natural for

91
00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:17.430
them to also supervise this new
kind of technological development.

92
00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:19.740
Or maybe it's
the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau,

93
00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:23.360
because the concerns that we would have
with these new financial innovations

94
00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:28.160
are primarily that they will be abused or
misused or deceptively advertised

95
00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.300
to consumers who are customers
of these financial institutions.

96
00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:37.360
But there are real concerns with having
such a fragmented regulated system.

97
00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:41.460
Two concerns that we had at the White
House with respect to the financial

98
00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:47.170
regulatory framework were first that
having such different authorities be

99
00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:52.090
responsible for different aspects of the
financial sector meant that information

100
00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:56.530
would get stuck with one regulator and
not find its way to the other.

101
00:06:56.530 --> 00:07:01.589
Even though together these two different
agencies set of impact information

102
00:07:01.589 --> 00:07:06.195
might hint at risks building up in
a particular sector of the economy.

103
00:07:06.195 --> 00:07:10.398
And so there was a concern about the lack
of ability of information to flow very

104
00:07:10.398 --> 00:07:12.025
freely between regulators.

105
00:07:12.025 --> 00:07:16.549
There's also a concern that from the
perspective of industry if you could be

106
00:07:16.549 --> 00:07:21.071
regulated through a state banking charter
or you could be regulated through

107
00:07:21.071 --> 00:07:25.099
a federal banking charter your
incentives are a structure to try and

108
00:07:25.099 --> 00:07:28.560
find the regulator who's
going to be easiest on you.

109
00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:32.680
There's empirical evidence that is
exactly what financial firms do.

110
00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:36.968
So it seems quite important to create
a regulatory structure that allows for

111
00:07:36.968 --> 00:07:40.921
information to flow freely, and
discourages the short of regulation

112
00:07:40.921 --> 00:07:45.548
shopping, that we know is commonplace
among sophisticated financial players.
