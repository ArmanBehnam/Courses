00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.635
I would be remiss in
this discussion of

2
00:00:04.635 --> 00:00:07.740
financial technology regulation
to not say a word or

3
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.265
two about the
emergence of RegTech.

4
00:00:11.265 --> 00:00:14.640
The idea behind
RegTech is that it

5
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.820
is actually financial
technology that helps

6
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.360
financial institutions
address regulatory challenges

7
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.760
and facilitates the delivery of

8
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.520
and the ability of
these institutions to comply

9
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.225
with existing regulatory
requirements.

10
00:00:30.225 --> 00:00:34.395
RegTech was created in order
to address challenges that

11
00:00:34.395 --> 00:00:36.360
arise from compliance in

12
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.060
risk management and things
like data reporting,

13
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.280
and is especially useful for

14
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.200
nascent financial firms who
don't yet have the capacity

15
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.975
internally to be able to

16
00:00:47.975 --> 00:00:51.770
create these sorts of
technologies for their own use.

17
00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.960
Some examples of
RegTech providers

18
00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.790
include companies like Suade,

19
00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.240
a software platform that allows
financial institutions to

20
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.580
process granular data and
output the required regulatory,

21
00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.320
calculations risks and reports

22
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.765
that financial regulators demand.

23
00:01:08.765 --> 00:01:13.425
Another example is
RegTech provider called Trulioo,

24
00:01:13.425 --> 00:01:15.620
which provides
ID verification for

25
00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.379
companies like PayPal,
Stripe, and Amazon,

26
00:01:18.379 --> 00:01:20.000
and helps them comply with

27
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.250
new know-your-customer
and anti-money

28
00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:23.870
laundering rules that have

29
00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.315
become of significant
importance in

30
00:01:26.315 --> 00:01:30.025
a significant regulatory burden
for these institutions,

31
00:01:30.025 --> 00:01:33.680
particularly in the aftermath
of the financial crisis.

32
00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.460
Looking forward, as we
think of the future of

33
00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:38.990
financial technology and

34
00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.385
financial technology
regulation specifically,

35
00:01:42.385 --> 00:01:44.480
it's important for us to
think about whether we

36
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.400
should regulate FinTech as

37
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.710
an industry in and
of itself or whether

38
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.350
FinTech comprises
a series of industries

39
00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.315
depending on whether it involves

40
00:01:53.315 --> 00:01:55.580
traditional financial
services providers

41
00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:56.840
doing new things,

42
00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.730
new financial services providers

43
00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:00.245
doing traditional things,

44
00:02:00.245 --> 00:02:04.310
or is totally new means of
transacting and means of

45
00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:05.990
exchange that didn't exist in

46
00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.825
the financial system previously.

47
00:02:08.825 --> 00:02:11.120
It's also important
that we be aware

48
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.490
that the kinds of
choices we make about

49
00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.155
regulation in this industry

50
00:02:15.155 --> 00:02:17.319
are inevitably going to impact

51
00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:19.850
the decisions the
entrepreneurs make with

52
00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.000
respect to where they locate
and where they innovate,

53
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.460
the ability of consumers
to be protected

54
00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.085
from new risks that
emerge in these markets,

55
00:02:28.085 --> 00:02:30.170
and the ability of
consumers to be able to

56
00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.450
benefit and leverage the power of

57
00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.705
new financial technology
to serve them in ways that

58
00:02:35.705 --> 00:02:38.240
existing financial
institutions prior to

59
00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.975
this FinTech revolution
were simply unable to.

60
00:02:41.975 --> 00:02:44.510
It's also important for
regulators to bear in

61
00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.210
mind that financial regulation,

62
00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.850
and particularly financial
technology where

63
00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.640
so much of the transacting
happens on the Internet,

64
00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.965
which is inherently
a global platform,

65
00:02:54.965 --> 00:02:57.395
would be best served
by regulation

66
00:02:57.395 --> 00:03:00.050
through a singular
global framework.

67
00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:01.760
Of course, this sort of history

68
00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.800
of financial regulation doesn't

69
00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.540
provide a lot of optimism for

70
00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.775
this being the
inevitable outcome.

71
00:03:07.775 --> 00:03:09.080
If anything, the
fact that there are

72
00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.880
a myriad financial
regulators even

73
00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.710
within the United States suggests

74
00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:14.810
the difficulty of being able to

75
00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.960
create a singular framework
for regulation,

76
00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.060
but it would be very helpful

77
00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.250
both from the perspective
of industry as it

78
00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:23.690
looks to operate across

79
00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.930
the world and from the
perspective of consumers as they

80
00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.210
look to be protected
no matter where the firm that

81
00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:31.885
provides them financial
services operates.

82
00:03:31.885 --> 00:03:33.470
It'll be helpful
for us to be able

83
00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:34.970
to create technologies and

84
00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.615
industries that are really
regulated in a uniform way.

85
00:03:38.615 --> 00:03:40.850
It's also important
for us to bear in

86
00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.250
mind that whatever choices
we make with respect

87
00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:44.285
to the regulation of

88
00:03:44.285 --> 00:03:46.829
new financial services providers

89
00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:49.250
and incidentally
whatever choices we make with

90
00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:50.570
respect to the regulation of

91
00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:53.075
traditional financial
services providers

92
00:03:53.075 --> 00:03:55.069
is inevitably going to encourage

93
00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:57.755
the growth of and push out of

94
00:03:57.755 --> 00:04:00.530
the regulated financial
sector activity

95
00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.515
that used to exist in this space.

96
00:04:02.515 --> 00:04:05.070
So one concern about over

97
00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:06.740
regulation or one concern

98
00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:08.720
about overly burdensome
regulation in

99
00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.730
this setting is that
we are going to

100
00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.280
push activity outside of a sector

101
00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.810
which we understand and have

102
00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.930
some framework for
regulating into sort of

103
00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:19.820
the shadow banking sector where

104
00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.005
our ability to manage
risk is much less strong.

105
00:04:23.005 --> 00:04:27.050
So as regulators and interested
audiences in this space,

106
00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.510
it's important for us
to understand that when

107
00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.000
we trade off in
the context of regulation,

108
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.890
it's not just trading off between

109
00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:35.510
innovation on one side and

110
00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:37.310
consumer protection on the other.

111
00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:38.510
But in fact striking

112
00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:43.040
the right balance not

113
00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.320
having overly
cumbersome regulation,

114
00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.230
that's going to encourage
activity to fly out of

115
00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:49.910
the regulated sector and

116
00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:51.710
pose a threat to
financial stability,

117
00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.420
but one that we don't
have a good handle

118
00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.980
on how best to address.
