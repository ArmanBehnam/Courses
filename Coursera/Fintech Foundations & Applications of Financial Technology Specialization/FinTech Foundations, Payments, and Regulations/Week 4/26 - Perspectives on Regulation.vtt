00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.820
In this module,
we're going to spend

2
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.550
some time trying to
think about how we

3
00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:07.650
regulate financial technology and

4
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.440
actually what is
financial technology before we

5
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.080
can get to the
regulatory frameworks

6
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.630
that are going to make
the most sense in this setting.

7
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.140
I want to start very broadly
and try and understand

8
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.739
the theoretical criticisms
around regulation period,

9
00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:24.540
and then try and understand

10
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.510
the concerns and
the innovations that we've made

11
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.640
with respect to
financial regulation in

12
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.280
particular since
the Great Recession.

13
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.600
I then want us to focus on
exactly what FinTech is,

14
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.805
why it's growing,
how it's growing,

15
00:00:37.805 --> 00:00:39.380
and also how different countries

16
00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.060
have approached the regulation of

17
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.370
financial technology
and what lessons

18
00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.145
that can teach us in
the future going forward.

19
00:00:46.145 --> 00:00:50.755
The traditional
like Chicago style,

20
00:00:50.755 --> 00:00:54.845
economic view of regulation
has been a suspicious one.

21
00:00:54.845 --> 00:00:57.170
So George Stigler
who famously won

22
00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.950
the Nobel Prize for the theory
of Economic Regulation,

23
00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.625
made the following observation.

24
00:01:03.625 --> 00:01:06.820
"Regulation may be actively
sought by an industry,

25
00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.555
or it may be thrust upon it.

26
00:01:08.555 --> 00:01:12.109
As a rule regulation is
acquired by the industry

27
00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:15.880
and is designed and operated
primarily for its benefit.

28
00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.140
At worst, regulation hinders

29
00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.035
growth and innovation
through bureaucracy."

30
00:01:21.035 --> 00:01:23.990
This Stiglerion perspective is

31
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.155
a bit about the nature
of regulatory capture.

32
00:01:27.155 --> 00:01:30.470
So because regulation
will be made

33
00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:31.985
by government regulators

34
00:01:31.985 --> 00:01:34.070
even well-intentioned regulators,

35
00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.410
those entities with resources

36
00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.600
like large financial institutions

37
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.820
who can lobby and
persuade the regulators

38
00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.190
that their concerns
are incredibly valid,

39
00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.710
can use regulation as a tool

40
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.460
to try and conform regulations

41
00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.480
so it is best equipped to

42
00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.005
deliver precisely what
the industry requests.

43
00:01:54.005 --> 00:01:56.540
This can mean both
under regulating

44
00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.220
financial institutions or in

45
00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.545
general under
regulating industry.

46
00:02:00.545 --> 00:02:01.865
But it can also mean

47
00:02:01.865 --> 00:02:04.910
aggressive regulation
in certain settings for

48
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.115
the purpose of keeping incumbents

49
00:02:07.115 --> 00:02:10.310
with significant market power
in these domains,

50
00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.400
and making it more difficult
for new competitors to

51
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.620
emerge and comply with
existing regulatory burdens.

52
00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.280
Milton Friedman view of
regulation is very similar.

53
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.030
His point made very
vividly is that,

54
00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.380
"Corruption is
government intrusion into

55
00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.250
market efficiencies in
the form of regulations."

56
00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.680
So the view is that
the market functions

57
00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.689
well, it functions freely,

58
00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:38.570
and regulation is going
to just come in and muck

59
00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.690
up a well-functioning market
and for the purpose

60
00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.305
of advantaging certain
industry participants

61
00:02:45.305 --> 00:02:49.325
who are best able to control
the regulatory process.

62
00:02:49.325 --> 00:02:51.470
This view of regulation
is certainly

63
00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.300
not shared by all and certainly

64
00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.130
not voiced by regulators in

65
00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.595
the aftermath of
the financial crisis,

66
00:02:57.595 --> 00:02:59.900
which many view as
the byproduct of

67
00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.600
an overly lax regulatory
framework with

68
00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.405
respect to large
financial institutions

69
00:03:05.405 --> 00:03:08.390
and financial intermediaries
more broadly.

70
00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:09.740
Christine Lagarde has made

71
00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:11.195
the point that regulation fields

72
00:03:11.195 --> 00:03:13.640
especially necessary in sectors

73
00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.289
like the financial sector,

74
00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:17.840
where large scale crises in

75
00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.750
this sector like
the Great Recession can expose

76
00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.120
entire countries
around the globe to

77
00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.365
substantial and significant
catastrophic effects,

78
00:03:27.365 --> 00:03:30.700
if there is in fact a crisis
like the recession.

79
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.275
This is distinct from failures in

80
00:03:33.275 --> 00:03:35.120
a particular industry
which is less

81
00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.064
connected than
the banking sector,

82
00:03:38.064 --> 00:03:40.820
and less attached to
every single decision and

83
00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.385
every single choice
that consumers

84
00:03:43.385 --> 00:03:46.010
and firms make with respect
to the investments that they

85
00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.390
choose for themselves in

86
00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.355
the businesses that they operate.

87
00:03:49.355 --> 00:03:52.070
Elizabeth Warren made
this observation

88
00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:54.635
with respect to
the financial crisis that

89
00:03:54.635 --> 00:03:56.630
although in other industries

90
00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.670
more conventional
consumer industries

91
00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:59.750
like car industries,

92
00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.805
toys, aspirin, meat, toasters,

93
00:04:01.805 --> 00:04:04.115
the analogy that
chooses quite vividly,

94
00:04:04.115 --> 00:04:06.440
nearly every product
sold has passed

95
00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.300
basic safety regulations well in

96
00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.460
advance of being
marketed and sold.

97
00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:12.350
But consumer credit tends to

98
00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:16.430
be what she calls
a buyer-beware, wild west,

99
00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.290
which is especially surprising

100
00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.660
given Christine regards
observation that

101
00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.085
crises in financial markets
have the potential to create

102
00:04:25.085 --> 00:04:30.140
real systemic consequences
for the globe as a whole.

103
00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:33.200
Interestingly, industry is
also quite understanding of

104
00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.510
the need for good and
thoughtful regulation

105
00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:37.120
in financial markets.

106
00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.130
Jamie Dimon the CEO of J.P.
Morgan makes the point that,

107
00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:42.290
good regulation should
simultaneously be

108
00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:45.185
conducive to business and
to consumer protection,

109
00:04:45.185 --> 00:04:47.180
allowing businesses
to innovate and

110
00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.760
create structures that
will be advantageous

111
00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.280
to consumers without
worrying about having to

112
00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.830
comply with overly
burdensome regulation,

113
00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:55.880
but simultaneously

114
00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.800
protecting consumers
from the risks that

115
00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.280
they encountered in
the Great Recession.

116
00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.490
George Soros makes
the point that the problem

117
00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.730
with the Milton Friedman
conception of markets being

118
00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:10.850
freely operational and
regulation being a means

119
00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:14.390
of corrupt interference in
well-functioning markets,

120
00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:18.025
is that in his conception
markets in fact are imperfect.

121
00:05:18.025 --> 00:05:20.645
So you'd need regulation,

122
00:05:20.645 --> 00:05:23.330
but of course regulators
are also imperfect.

123
00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:27.944
So the regulatory process
requires simultaneous adaption,

124
00:05:27.944 --> 00:05:31.430
both by industry and by
regulators to come to a set of

125
00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.230
processes that are going to well

126
00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:36.150
protect consumers
in these markets.
