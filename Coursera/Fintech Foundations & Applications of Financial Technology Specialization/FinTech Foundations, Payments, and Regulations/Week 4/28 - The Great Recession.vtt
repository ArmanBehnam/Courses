00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:05.430
As we've talked about
regulation is helpful from

2
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.500
the perspective of
a consumer because it

3
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.900
creates safer product markets.

4
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.280
On the other hand,

5
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.460
it discourages innovation
and makes it easier for

6
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.165
incumbents to control
some of these markets.

7
00:00:18.165 --> 00:00:20.330
So in thinking about
this trade-off,

8
00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.000
we need to weigh
the enhanced benefit to

9
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.910
consumer safety with
the losses that consumers

10
00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:26.990
suffer from markets

11
00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.840
that aren't perfectly functioning
or markets that aren't

12
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.000
sufficiently innovative
as they would

13
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.745
be if they were less
heavily regulated.

14
00:00:34.745 --> 00:00:36.320
There's of course a reason to

15
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.270
think that financial regulation

16
00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.870
is different than regulation
of products more generally.

17
00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.030
As we've discussed
the losses that come

18
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.460
from financial crises
are large and

19
00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.710
widespread and born by

20
00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.515
entire communities
and entire countries,

21
00:00:52.515 --> 00:00:54.830
not just by particular
consumers of

22
00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.495
one kind of product
that malfunctions, let's say.

23
00:00:58.495 --> 00:01:00.260
The Great Recession provides a

24
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.685
quite a helpful case study

25
00:01:01.685 --> 00:01:03.590
about the nature
of risks that can

26
00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.410
emerge in financial markets
and the harm that can be

27
00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.470
caused to consumers when
these markets go awry.

28
00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.240
The losses of the Great Recession

29
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.175
were large and widespread.

30
00:01:13.175 --> 00:01:14.600
In the US alone,

31
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.615
over eight million Americans
lost their jobs,

32
00:01:17.615 --> 00:01:20.595
eight million American homes
were foreclosed upon,

33
00:01:20.595 --> 00:01:23.325
2.5 million businesses
were closed,

34
00:01:23.325 --> 00:01:25.310
there was a 12 percent decline

35
00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.560
in median real family income,

36
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.265
a 40 percent decline in
median real net worth,

37
00:01:31.265 --> 00:01:35.180
and a 4.3 percent
decline in real GDP.

38
00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.265
These are substantial
decreases in

39
00:01:37.265 --> 00:01:40.230
the wealth of the United
States as a whole.

40
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.190
But also are born primarily by

41
00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.875
actual real American consumers

42
00:01:45.875 --> 00:01:48.200
who lost their jobs
or found their homes

43
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.410
foreclosed upon with
little ability to remedy

44
00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.900
the situation and recover

45
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.480
the losses that they had
suffered during the crisis,

46
00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.220
in often instances because

47
00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.680
of no malfeasance of their own.

48
00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.090
In the United States,

49
00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:03.799
the most significant post-crisis

50
00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:05.570
financial reform was the passage

51
00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.370
of the Dodd-Frank
Wall Street Reform

52
00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.515
and Consumer Protection Act.

53
00:02:09.515 --> 00:02:13.370
Even the name of the Dodd-Frank
Act in and of itself,

54
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.220
illustrates the dual
priorities that regulators

55
00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.910
had in the aftermath of
the financial crisis.

56
00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.100
The focus certainly
was on creating

57
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.145
a financial sector that
was better functioning,

58
00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:26.509
that was better regulated,

59
00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:28.190
and less likely to
suffer the kind of

60
00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.870
systemic collapse that had

61
00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.300
occurred and had
been brought about

62
00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.480
and exacerbated by the recession.

63
00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.760
But simultaneously,
the focus was on

64
00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.830
consumer protection
and making sure

65
00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.280
that in the future consumers
had better information and

66
00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.680
more information about
the kind of risks that were

67
00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.110
associated with
their financial products,

68
00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:49.670
and a way by which to voice

69
00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.490
their grievances to regulators in

70
00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.080
the case that consumers felt that

71
00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.475
financial institutions we're
not serving them well.

72
00:02:57.475 --> 00:02:59.450
A very significant reform

73
00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.070
following the crisis was in fact

74
00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.369
the creation of the Consumer
Financial Protection Bureau,

75
00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:07.010
whose entire mandate
is to regulate

76
00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.650
these institutions from
the perspective of

77
00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.080
consumers to supervise
these institutions

78
00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.940
to pass rules and require them to

79
00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.160
comply with behaviors that are

80
00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.770
going to best serve consumers,

81
00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.875
and be sure to read
these markets of unfair,

82
00:03:21.875 --> 00:03:25.240
abusive, and deceptive
acts and practices.

83
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.730
Another significant
reform following

84
00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.060
the crisis in the banking sector
in the United States,

85
00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.160
was to drastically
increase the amount of

86
00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.680
capital banks are
required to hold in

87
00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.990
order to engage in
business practices like

88
00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:42.400
lending to small businesses
and lending to consumers.

89
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.650
As a result of
these interventions,

90
00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.865
large financial
institutions are today

91
00:03:46.865 --> 00:03:49.700
much better capitalized
than they were before

92
00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.310
the crisis and much
better equipped to

93
00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.310
whether the next crisis
whenever it will hit.

94
00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.140
This is a substantial improvement

95
00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.870
relative to the pre-crisis
financial system.

96
00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.770
Additionally, we've
created a framework for

97
00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:05.900
regular annual stress-testing of

98
00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.760
large banks to make sure that

99
00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.170
they're going to be able to hold

100
00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.180
sufficient capital to withstand

101
00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.190
the next crisis and tailoring

102
00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.760
the capital requirements that
they're required to hold to

103
00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:17.930
new risks that emerge in

104
00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.200
financial markets
as time progresses.

105
00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.700
But importantly, as we've

106
00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.500
made substantial improvements on

107
00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:25.880
the regulatory framework for

108
00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.315
a traditional financial
institutions,

109
00:04:28.315 --> 00:04:30.590
we've also created incentives

110
00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.470
for activity that
used to happen in

111
00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.275
this regulated traditional
financial sector

112
00:04:36.275 --> 00:04:38.690
to shift out of
the traditional sector

113
00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.790
and instead be initiated by

114
00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:44.045
less regulated shadow
banking entities,

115
00:04:44.045 --> 00:04:45.380
who are able to perform

116
00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.920
these services at
much cheaper costs.

117
00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.250
A recent paper by Brian Chen,

118
00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:51.930
Sam Hanson and Jeremy Stein,

119
00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.370
a former governor of
the Federal Reserve Bank,

120
00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.810
note that, to a large extent,

121
00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:59.225
big financial institutions
have gotten out

122
00:04:59.225 --> 00:05:01.670
of the business of
small business lending,

123
00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:05.060
perhaps because of the
increased in regulatory burden

124
00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.900
required to be able to
participate in this market.

125
00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.620
One of the consequences of
this movement has been that

126
00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.050
traditional small
business lending is now

127
00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.870
being done by the
less-regulated, nonbank sector.

128
00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:19.160
In fact, these authors

129
00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.140
observed that in places
where big banks have

130
00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:22.370
left the business of

131
00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:24.740
small business lending
most substantially.

132
00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.980
Peer-to-peer lenders like
Prosper like Lending Club,

133
00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:30.260
have come in to fill
the void that's been

134
00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.085
left by these financial
institutions.

135
00:05:33.085 --> 00:05:37.190
The concern is that if
this activity is being driven

136
00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.410
out of the traditional
financial sector

137
00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:41.300
and into shadow banks, well,

138
00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.190
the traditional financial
sector at least has

139
00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:45.350
some regulatory
framework but as they

140
00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:47.300
exist currently and
as we're going to

141
00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.640
talk about over the course
of this series,

142
00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:53.375
it's unclear that
the shadow banking sector has

143
00:05:53.375 --> 00:05:56.180
either a framework or
regulation in place

144
00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:00.210
to ensure the safety and
stability of these markets.
