00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:05.070
Before we think about how to regulate
FinTech, I think it's quite important for

2
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:11.150
us to come to an understanding of what, if
many things, we think FinTech actually is.

3
00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.975
In the years following the financial
crisis, entrepreneurs saw the need for

4
00:00:14.975 --> 00:00:19.085
new types of financial businesses
including the creation of low cost ways

5
00:00:19.085 --> 00:00:24.605
to invest, household savings, platforms
that make it easy to borrow money

6
00:00:24.605 --> 00:00:28.075
from one another rather than with
the use of a commercial bank.

7
00:00:28.075 --> 00:00:33.505
Faster payment methods, mediums to crowd
fund projects and entrepreneurial startups

8
00:00:33.505 --> 00:00:39.680
and low cost ways to transfer
money abroad or across consumers.

9
00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:46.500
And so what of the following to you feels
like a financial technology innovation?

10
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.290
An app that allows you
to deposit checks via

11
00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:55.330
your smartphone to a traditional financial
institution like Bank of America?

12
00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.620
A new peer to peer lending platform,
something like Lending Club,

13
00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.110
where you can borrow funds theoretically
from your next-door neighbor, in reality,

14
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.040
from large institutional investors who
purchase these loans from Lending Club?

15
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:15.430
A website that makes it easier to do
international remittance transfers?

16
00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.360
A entirely new medium of
exchange of value, like Bitcoin?

17
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.910
The use of what are now thought
of as traditional platforms,

18
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.080
but historically very new
platforms like Facebook,

19
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.160
to facilitate the process
of consumer payments.

20
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.500
So in reality,
it's quite interesting to try and

21
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:42.020
place some of these financial
innovations on a bit of a spectrum from

22
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:48.620
totally new ideas and new kinds of
businesses, things like Bitcoin,

23
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:54.820
to traditional businesses, things like
Bank of America, getting involved in and

24
00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.680
taking advantage of new technologies
that exist in the world.

25
00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.850
I think it's quite useful to think about
financial technologies as involving

26
00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.780
sort of business practices and
financial institutions.

27
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.320
And the relative newness
kind of varies depending

28
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.550
on the particular products
that we're talking about.

29
00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.370
So if we take the example of Bank of
America creating a mobile platform.

30
00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.390
Well, Bank of America is at this point
a traditional financial institution

31
00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.630
that's getting involved in
a traditional banking practice,

32
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.470
the deposit of checks, but
doing so with a new technology.

33
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.890
You can contrast that to someone like
Facebook getting involved in payments.

34
00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.940
Again Facebook is
a traditional business but

35
00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.930
not a traditional
financial business at all.

36
00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.680
And payments are a traditional
sort of activity that

37
00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.640
financial institutions engage in but
of course not in this way.

38
00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.240
To take a third example, if we think of
someone like Lending Club, they're getting

39
00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:01.800
involved in a traditional financial
practice, which is consumer lending.

40
00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.340
But they're doing so
with an entirely new platform.

41
00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.525
And so the reason why it's important
to bifurcate the layers of

42
00:03:09.525 --> 00:03:12.325
newness in financial technology

43
00:03:12.325 --> 00:03:17.285
is because the kind of regulatory
framework we will want to adopt will be

44
00:03:17.285 --> 00:03:22.850
a byproduct of the existing regulation
that already exists in that space.

45
00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:27.170
So, when you think about traditional
financial institutions doing traditional

46
00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.190
financial activities,
albeit with new technologies,

47
00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.250
the sort of new regulatory framework
that you have to conceive up for

48
00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:41.030
that setting is much less extreme than
in the case of something like bitcoin,

49
00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:47.300
which involves an entirely new
as a class in accents entirely

50
00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:53.370
new business practices that regulators
really having conceived of in the past.

51
00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.900
And so they kind of, it's almost
a misnomer where this whole mergal

52
00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.960
is almost a misnomer as we think about
financial technology regulation.

53
00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:07.079
Because the kind of regulation that
we're going to need to conceive

54
00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:09.606
of is inherently going
to be a byproduct of

55
00:04:09.606 --> 00:04:14.470
the particular practice that we're
considering a new financial technology.

56
00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.196
Even the name FinTech is quite
useful as a sort of guidepost for

57
00:04:18.196 --> 00:04:21.360
the kind of technology
that we're thinking about.

58
00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:25.789
Of course it just involves the contraction
of financial and technology.

59
00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.685
At first, FinTech referred to
technology that tended to improve

60
00:04:30.685 --> 00:04:33.990
back-end systems at traditional
financial institutions.

61
00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.720
Things like these mobile apps that
large banks had managed to develop

62
00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.070
that provide tremendous convenience and

63
00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:44.410
real amenities to the consumers
that bank with these institutions.

64
00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:48.300
But with the emergence of entirely new
players in businesses like lending,

65
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.860
like investing,
like crowdfunding, payments and

66
00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:56.020
much more, the definition of FinTech has
necessarily been significantly broadened.

67
00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:01.470
And again it's this breadth that is going
to make regulation quite challenging.

68
00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:06.930
Because while we tend to talk about and
tend to think about FinTech as one thing,

69
00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:11.880
one group, they include these
well-regulated sort of well-established

70
00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.240
firms who are used to doing
financial service provision,

71
00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.260
like the JP Morgans of the world

72
00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:24.139
that are doing totally new things like
launching their own cryptocurrency.

73
00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:30.420
FinTech also involves startups
doing existing finance differently.

74
00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:34.310
Things like Venmo in the payment space,
or Prosper and

75
00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:40.370
Lending Club in the lending space, or robo
advisors in the investment advising space.

76
00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:43.280
And they involve startups
disrupting the way we think about

77
00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.430
the financial system altogether.

78
00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:49.842
Things like these decentralized
blockchain based marketplaces.
