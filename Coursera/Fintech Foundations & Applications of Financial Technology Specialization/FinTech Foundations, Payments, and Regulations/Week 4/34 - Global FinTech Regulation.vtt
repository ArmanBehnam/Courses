00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.454
In the FinTech space
particularly globally,

2
00:00:04.454 --> 00:00:08.565
there's been a lot of discussion
of regulatory sandboxes.

3
00:00:08.565 --> 00:00:12.440
So what exactly is
a regulatory sandbox?

4
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.120
Well, what is the sandbox?
Let's start there.

5
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.040
A sandbox for those
of you who don't

6
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.500
know is a small space that has

7
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.300
a bunch of sand in it where

8
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.255
kids go to play during
lunch or recess.

9
00:00:24.255 --> 00:00:25.940
The idea is that they use

10
00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.000
their imagination and
then create sand castles,

11
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.780
and tunnels, and enjoy
playing with their peers.

12
00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.420
The term regulatory
sandbox actually

13
00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.960
comes from the sandbox
that kids play in.

14
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.810
The idea behind
a regulatory sandbox is in

15
00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.755
this imaginative
environment of play.

16
00:00:45.755 --> 00:00:47.600
Innovators have the freedom to

17
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.790
explore and think
about new solutions,

18
00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.530
and new products to

19
00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.115
existing problems that exist
in markets without being

20
00:00:55.115 --> 00:00:58.070
overly burden by
regulatory frameworks that

21
00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.160
are more appropriate
for mature industries.

22
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.365
One idea of how to think

23
00:01:03.365 --> 00:01:05.720
about the regulation of
financial technology going

24
00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.690
forward and one idea that's
been proposed roughly

25
00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.210
between the Euro areas,

26
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.310
the United States, and

27
00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.130
Hong Kong is to come
together to form

28
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.280
a global financial technology
sandbox to provide

29
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.200
a reprieve for new and
emerging industries and new,

30
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.850
and emerging firms
who seek to innovate

31
00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.205
and provide financial services to

32
00:01:31.205 --> 00:01:33.710
consumers in ways that
they haven't before,

33
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:34.850
and to seek to provide

34
00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.740
financial services
to consumers who

35
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.190
have traditionally been left
out of the financial sector.

36
00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:41.960
I thought it would
be useful to think

37
00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.970
about how a few
countries outside of

38
00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.830
the United States
have thought about

39
00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.835
the approach to
regulation of FinTech.

40
00:01:48.835 --> 00:01:51.200
In Australia, FinTechs are

41
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.450
regulated by the Australian ASIC,

42
00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.420
the Australian Securities
and Investment Commission.

43
00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.140
The idea behind ASIC is that
it is focused on helping

44
00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.880
FinTech companies
think through which

45
00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.340
licenses and regulations
apply to them,

46
00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.100
and making sure that
both consumers and

47
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.570
investors are protected when

48
00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:10.120
dealing with these new firms.

49
00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:13.940
ASIC created a regulatory
sandbox for FinTechs.

50
00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.810
The idea behind the sandbox
was that for up to 12 months,

51
00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.615
new financial firms could operate

52
00:02:20.615 --> 00:02:23.420
and test products that
they hope to bring

53
00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.970
to a broader market
without needing

54
00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.470
a credit license from

55
00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.240
the Australian
financial authorities.

56
00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.545
The UK is attempting to create

57
00:02:32.545 --> 00:02:36.250
a global FinTech sandbox
with the help of helping

58
00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.740
financial technology
companies who

59
00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.470
have cross-border
ambitions grow in

60
00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.260
a way that is safe for
consumers but also

61
00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.270
facilitates the emergence
of these new industries.

62
00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.540
The UK's had
significant success with

63
00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.000
respect to its
regulatory sandbox.

64
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.610
The idea behind
each sandbox is that it

65
00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.790
partners with firms that
meet a set of requirements,

66
00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.400
and allows those
particular institutions

67
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.530
to test products without

68
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.870
complying with the full set
of regulations that are

69
00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.590
typically required of
financial services providers.

70
00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.870
In order to conduct these tests,

71
00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.060
these new firms work
very closely with

72
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.350
UK regulators in order to

73
00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.930
make sure consumers are
sufficiently protected.

74
00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.449
Additionally, these firms
are given a reprieve

75
00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:23.780
from regulatory enforcement
actions against

76
00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.630
them for not being
able to comply with

77
00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:27.860
different requirements that are

78
00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.975
required of more mature firms.

79
00:03:29.975 --> 00:03:33.620
After the testing period has
expired for the sandbox,

80
00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.630
financial technology
companies have

81
00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.750
the opportunity to think
about whether they want to

82
00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.209
continue to provide
this service or modify

83
00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:44.485
it as the company
becomes more mature.

84
00:03:44.485 --> 00:03:46.820
Singapore has also adopted

85
00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:50.480
a regulatory sandbox to enable
financial innovators and

86
00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.795
existing financial
technology players to use

87
00:03:53.795 --> 00:03:55.910
this opportunity
to experiment with

88
00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.895
innovative financial
products or services.

89
00:03:58.895 --> 00:04:02.150
The idea behind
the regulatory sandbox is

90
00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.360
to under the guidance of
regulatory supervision,

91
00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.885
test new financial
technology products,

92
00:04:08.885 --> 00:04:11.540
and determine whether
they're well suited,

93
00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.120
and likely to solve
an existing problem that

94
00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.150
exists in the
financial marketplace.

95
00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.820
China is an example of
a country that has taken

96
00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.500
a relatively loose approach to

97
00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.065
regulation over
financial technology.

98
00:04:24.065 --> 00:04:27.050
Their attitude is to think
of the whole country as

99
00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:28.820
a regulatory sandbox where

100
00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.815
new technologies can be tested,

101
00:04:30.815 --> 00:04:33.560
and new ideas can be
implemented without

102
00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.010
concern over a significant
litigation threat,

103
00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.450
or concerned that you would run

104
00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:41.215
awry of financial regulators.

105
00:04:41.215 --> 00:04:44.630
However, some regulation has
indeed been implemented.

106
00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.660
The Ministry of Industry
and Information Technology

107
00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.400
has begun to produce ratings

108
00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.440
for blockchain products and

109
00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.990
Beijing has banned
initial coin offerings,

110
00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:55.250
and blocked websites that

111
00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.880
offer cryptocurrency
trading services.

112
00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.030
This interventions
have been mostly with

113
00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.060
respect to blockchain
but in general,

114
00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.310
China has tried to
really encourage

115
00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:07.425
the growth of innovation
in financial technology,

116
00:05:07.425 --> 00:05:10.055
and tried to encourage

117
00:05:10.055 --> 00:05:12.740
entrepreneurs who are
developing in this space to

118
00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.680
locate it in China where
they'll have access to

119
00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.875
significant testing for
new financial technologies,

120
00:05:18.875 --> 00:05:21.545
and also be able to
think about how best to

121
00:05:21.545 --> 00:05:25.325
scale up the industries
that they're developing.

122
00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:29.000
The experience of
financial technology regulation

123
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.250
both here in the US and abroad,

124
00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:33.379
provides some very
useful takeaways

125
00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:35.240
for thinking about
the development of

126
00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.700
a regulatory framework
that's cogent and

127
00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:40.510
well suited to protect consumers.

128
00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:42.080
Here in the US, some of

129
00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.360
the struggles we've
had with respect to

130
00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.970
the OCC FinTech charter
as well as in

131
00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:48.770
the pre-crisis period
with respect to

132
00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:50.945
financial regulation
more generally,

133
00:05:50.945 --> 00:05:53.030
illustrate that clearly defining

134
00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:55.370
internal regulatory
authority is are

135
00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:57.350
truly necessary step for

136
00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:00.230
a coherent financial
technology regulation.

137
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:02.419
This could mean
practically deciding

138
00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:06.365
which regulatory body is
best suited to be in charge

139
00:06:06.365 --> 00:06:08.555
of financial
technology regulation

140
00:06:08.555 --> 00:06:11.840
broadly or it could mean
embracing the fact that

141
00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.994
different kinds of
financial technology providers

142
00:06:15.994 --> 00:06:19.310
operate in different spaces
and are differently mature,

143
00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:21.770
and so the regulatory
framework has to be

144
00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:25.625
heterogeneous to adjust for
these varied properties.

145
00:06:25.625 --> 00:06:28.280
The experience of
regulatory sandboxes

146
00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.380
essentially across the globe,

147
00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:32.750
particularly in
the United Kingdom,

148
00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:35.300
have been found to
increase the value and

149
00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:38.090
the capabilities of
participating firms,

150
00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:40.010
providing the opportunity for

151
00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:42.290
these firms to
develop and innovate,

152
00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:44.990
and play in
this sandbox framework

153
00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:47.090
while also protecting
and safeguarding

154
00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:49.910
consumers against
risks that emerged

155
00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:53.630
from nascent industry players.

156
00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:57.050
The experience of China
shows both the benefits and

157
00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:58.940
the pitfalls of having
a loose approach

158
00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:01.460
to financial
technology regulation.

159
00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:04.070
The absence of regulation
has certainly sparked

160
00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:07.235
a boom in existing
financial technology and

161
00:07:07.235 --> 00:07:10.130
encourage innovators
to relocate or to do

162
00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:13.130
business significantly in
China where essentially,

163
00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:15.125
the whole country
many think of as

164
00:07:15.125 --> 00:07:18.260
a regulatory sandbox
with respect to

165
00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.830
news FinTechs but
the lack of oversight in

166
00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:24.290
these markets also give rise to

167
00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:26.840
scams and high risk
financial models,

168
00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:28.160
and make it difficult for

169
00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.410
regulators to have
a framework by which to

170
00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:34.700
intervene in these new industries
if they've relinquished

171
00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:37.220
regulatory authority
at the get-go in

172
00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:40.360
order to encourage them to
develop in the country.

173
00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.470
For all the experience of

174
00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:44.690
financial technology
regulation and

175
00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:47.449
the experience of financial
regulation more broadly,

176
00:07:47.449 --> 00:07:49.400
suggests that
the best case scenario

177
00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.230
for regulators going
forward would be

178
00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:52.400
the true development of

179
00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:55.945
a global framework for
regulation in the space.

180
00:07:55.945 --> 00:07:58.520
The country's
specific requirements

181
00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.710
for different financial
services providers

182
00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:02.540
are complicated given that

183
00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:05.195
financial markets are
incredibly global,

184
00:08:05.195 --> 00:08:07.580
and so having
different requirements

185
00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:09.950
in different countries
in which you operate is

186
00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:11.960
burdensome from
their perspective of

187
00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:14.900
industry but also creates
tremendous incentives for

188
00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:19.070
gaming requirements in order
to pick the country's or

189
00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:21.500
the regulatory authorities
that are going to be most

190
00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:24.575
friendly to your
risk-taking activities.

191
00:08:24.575 --> 00:08:26.840
One bright note for the future of

192
00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:30.245
financial technology regulation
is the suggestion that

193
00:08:30.245 --> 00:08:34.070
new global regulatory sandboxes

194
00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:36.110
be considered to facilitate

195
00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:38.495
both singular framework for

196
00:08:38.495 --> 00:08:42.530
the regulatory compliance
for these nascent firms,

197
00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:45.950
but also to facilitate
cross-border growth of

198
00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:47.750
these new industries that have

199
00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:52.350
significant potential to
help best serve consumers.
