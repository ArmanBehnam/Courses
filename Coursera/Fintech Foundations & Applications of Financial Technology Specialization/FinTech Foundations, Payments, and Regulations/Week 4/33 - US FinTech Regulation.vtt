1
00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.650
Different countries have
adopted different approaches

2
00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.815
with respect to the regulation
of financial technology.

3
00:00:07.815 --> 00:00:10.770
Peer-to-peer lending
illustrates the wide variety of

4
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:14.040
regulatory approaches adopted
by different localities.

5
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.530
For example, in
Germany and France,

6
00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.715
peer-to-peer platforms
are regulated like banks.

7
00:00:19.715 --> 00:00:22.320
In the United States,
that's not the case because

8
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.260
to be a bank you must
also make deposits.

9
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.960
Regulation falls to the SEC and

10
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.580
these activities are treated
like securities issuances.

11
00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.265
Some countries like Japan and

12
00:00:34.265 --> 00:00:37.610
Israel outright prohibit
peer-to-peer lending and

13
00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.460
don't allow consumers in
those markets to have access to

14
00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.000
these kinds of
new financial technologies.

15
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.235
We're going to talk
a little bit about

16
00:00:46.235 --> 00:00:48.260
approaches to financial
regulation here in

17
00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.840
the United States as well
as in other countries and

18
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.205
kind of compare and contrast
a variety of approaches.

19
00:00:54.205 --> 00:00:56.060
Here in the United States,

20
00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.490
perhaps motivated
by concerns that

21
00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.760
regulation would happen in
a haphazard manner across

22
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.030
a variety of regulatory
agencies rather than in

23
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.160
a consistent way that
provide its sort

24
00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.800
of broad faint framework
for the industry.

25
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.990
In 2018, the Office of the

26
00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.300
Comptroller of
the Currency, the OCC,

27
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.680
and the US Treasury

28
00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.405
announced that they
would begin accepting

29
00:01:17.405 --> 00:01:19.940
applications for
special bank charters,

30
00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.240
particularly for FinTechs.

31
00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.780
Eligibility for these new OCC

32
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.120
special FinTech charters would be

33
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.400
restricted to financial
technology service providers

34
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.570
who do not take deposits,

35
00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:33.590
otherwise they would just be

36
00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.480
regulated as traditional banks,

37
00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.950
but otherwise engaged in

38
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.690
the business of
banking, for example,

39
00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:39.800
by lending money to

40
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.670
consumers through
peer-to-peer platforms.

41
00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.080
The reaction of
state regulators to

42
00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.330
this sort of suggestion
by the OCC for

43
00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:48.920
a national banking charter for

44
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.200
financial technology
providers was

45
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.215
swift and deeply concerned.

46
00:01:54.215 --> 00:01:56.550
In 2017, the Conference of

47
00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.855
State Bank Supervisors
sued the OCC

48
00:01:59.855 --> 00:02:02.420
alleging that it lacked
the statutory authority to

49
00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.080
charter nondepository financial
technology companies.

50
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.184
The Conference of State Bank
Supervisors was concerned

51
00:02:09.184 --> 00:02:12.350
that the operation of
a federal banking charter with

52
00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.125
respect to these
nondepository institutions

53
00:02:15.125 --> 00:02:17.450
would make it impossible
for them to impose

54
00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:18.935
higher standards on

55
00:02:18.935 --> 00:02:21.500
financial technology service
providers who impose

56
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.870
unique risks with respect

57
00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.485
to the consumers in
their particular states.

58
00:02:26.485 --> 00:02:28.340
That's sort of
the charitable view of

59
00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.030
the concerns that
the State Bank Supervisors had.

60
00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.650
Another set of
interpretations is simply

61
00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.770
an example of regulatory
turf wars where states

62
00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.450
didn't want to provide
the ability to

63
00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.730
regulate or restrain
themselves from the ability

64
00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:41.870
to intervene in

65
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.010
these particular financial
technology providers.

66
00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.125
Well, of course, there
are problems with

67
00:02:48.125 --> 00:02:51.130
the idea of an OCC
FinTech Charter.

68
00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.450
There are, of course,

69
00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.490
benefits from creating
a single structure that is

70
00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.410
responsible for the regulation of

71
00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.385
these new and
emerging industries.

72
00:03:00.385 --> 00:03:02.570
The issues of not having

73
00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.430
a single framework
responsible for

74
00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.695
regulation are well illustrated
by a series of examples.

75
00:03:08.695 --> 00:03:11.922
Currently, new digital
payments firms or

76
00:03:11.922 --> 00:03:15.169
cryptocurrencies in the
current regulatory environment

77
00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:17.420
are regulated both under

78
00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.970
the Federal Banking
Security Act and so have to

79
00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.950
register with
the Treasury as well as

80
00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.235
gain state licenses
in order to operate.

81
00:03:24.235 --> 00:03:27.200
There is no national consensus
on the ability of

82
00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.510
peer-to-peer platforms to operate

83
00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.715
in different states
across the country.

84
00:03:31.715 --> 00:03:33.800
LendingClub is able to operate in

85
00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.590
more states than prosper
and there are states

86
00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.950
where individuals can take
out loans from LendingClub

87
00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.450
but not purchase loans and be on

88
00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.660
the other side of
these transactions.

89
00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.980
These sorts of differences
create opportunities

90
00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.200
for regulatory arbitrage
on the behalf

91
00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.955
of firms and also create

92
00:03:49.955 --> 00:03:52.010
a set of restrictions
that are very difficult

93
00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.050
to comply with from
their perspective of

94
00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.255
new and emerging industries

95
00:03:56.255 --> 00:03:58.015
and new and emerging

96
00:03:58.015 --> 00:04:00.710
financial services
providers who would

97
00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:02.060
like some clarity about

98
00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.745
what requirements they have
to meet in order to operate

99
00:04:04.745 --> 00:04:06.770
but don't have
the resources to be able

100
00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:09.770
to meet high regulatory burdens

101
00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:12.290
that are differential depending
on the state in which

102
00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.900
they seek to do business
or gain new customers.
