00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.540
I wanted to take
a moment to thank you so

2
00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.880
much for listening
to these modules

3
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.860
that we've done on
payments and on

4
00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.025
the regulation of
the financial technology sector.

5
00:00:11.025 --> 00:00:13.590
These are incredibly
important questions

6
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:14.685
as we think about

7
00:00:14.685 --> 00:00:16.200
globally how best we

8
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.360
address regulatory
challenges in this space,

9
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.190
and I'm thrilled that

10
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.400
you listened this far
in this discussion,

11
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.840
and hope that you
learn something,

12
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.390
and you can carry it forward
in your work in the future.

13
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.460
Best of luck, and thank
you so much again.
