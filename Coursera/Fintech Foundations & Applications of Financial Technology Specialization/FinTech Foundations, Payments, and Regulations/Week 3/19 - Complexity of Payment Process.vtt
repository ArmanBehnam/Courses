1
00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:05.110
One problem in
the payment network system

2
00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:06.385
is that it involves

3
00:00:06.385 --> 00:00:08.980
a really complicated series of

4
00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.745
transactions that need
to be authorized,

5
00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:15.460
authenticated, clear,
and settle in a process

6
00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:16.510
that at least in

7
00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.570
current iterations is
not at all in real time.

8
00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.480
Let's think about what
happens when you use

9
00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.645
your credit card as
a means of transacting.

10
00:00:25.645 --> 00:00:29.470
So you go to the local grocery
store and you give the

11
00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:35.020
grocer your credit card to
purchase a $100 of groceries.

12
00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.765
The merchant then has to send

13
00:00:37.765 --> 00:00:40.450
those credit card details to

14
00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.870
the merchants acquiring bank.

15
00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.100
The merchants acquiring bank is

16
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.295
responsible for
getting the funds from

17
00:00:49.295 --> 00:00:54.575
the card holders issuing
bank back to the merchant.

18
00:00:54.575 --> 00:00:56.300
So the acquiring bank,

19
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.860
the merchant's bank then

20
00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.154
forwards those
credit card details

21
00:01:00.154 --> 00:01:02.060
to the credit card network

22
00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.625
let's say MasterCard
in this setting,

23
00:01:04.625 --> 00:01:07.970
and then MasterCard goes
to the customer's bank,

24
00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.519
the issuing bank and then request

25
00:01:10.519 --> 00:01:14.005
payment authorization
for that transaction.

26
00:01:14.005 --> 00:01:16.300
Next the issuing bank,

27
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.650
the customer's bank has to verify

28
00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.060
the card information that it

29
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.705
receives from
the credit card network.

30
00:01:22.705 --> 00:01:25.250
If customer funds are available

31
00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.410
for that transaction it has to

32
00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:28.940
send an approval code to

33
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.195
the merchant via
the same series of channels.

34
00:01:32.195 --> 00:01:35.570
Through the initial card
network MasterCard in

35
00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.055
this case back to the acquiring
bank the merchant's bank,

36
00:01:40.055 --> 00:01:43.700
then back through
the acquirer to the merchant,

37
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.430
and then the merchants
payment terminal

38
00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.210
collects all the approvals
from this complicated process

39
00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.090
and approves the
transaction providing

40
00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.085
the customer with the sales slip

41
00:01:55.085 --> 00:01:57.845
to complete this purchase.

42
00:01:57.845 --> 00:02:00.140
At this point the transaction

43
00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.939
has been approved
by the customer,

44
00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:05.020
but no funds have
actually exchanged hands.

45
00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.180
Now the merchant is going to
have to send the batch of

46
00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.280
approved transactions back to

47
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.575
his bank, the acquiring bank.

48
00:02:12.575 --> 00:02:15.935
The acquiring bank then has
to forward that approval

49
00:02:15.935 --> 00:02:17.680
back to the credit card network,

50
00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.805
MasterCard for settlement.

51
00:02:19.805 --> 00:02:21.650
The credit card network has to

52
00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.840
send every approved
transaction to

53
00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.800
the appropriate issuing bank,
the customer's bank.

54
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.980
Then the customer's bank
is going to have

55
00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.990
to transfer the funds back to

56
00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.990
the acquiring bank
routing it through

57
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.910
the credit card network through

58
00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.370
a series of complex transactions,

59
00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.425
each of which has a fee

60
00:02:42.425 --> 00:02:45.575
for the participating
institution.

61
00:02:45.575 --> 00:02:48.020
At this point the transaction has

62
00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:49.850
been approved but no funds have

63
00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.680
actually been transferred between

64
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.690
the cardholder and the merchant.

65
00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.705
So now the merchant
is going to send

66
00:02:56.705 --> 00:02:59.405
notice of the
approved transaction

67
00:02:59.405 --> 00:03:01.835
to his bank, the acquiring bank.

68
00:03:01.835 --> 00:03:04.835
The acquiring bank is
then going to send

69
00:03:04.835 --> 00:03:07.160
that approval along to

70
00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.780
the card network MasterCard
for settlement in this case.

71
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.500
The card network sends

72
00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.900
every approved transaction to
the customers issuing bank,

73
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.405
and then the issuing
bank transfers funds

74
00:03:20.405 --> 00:03:23.900
through the card network
to the acquiring bank,

75
00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.640
and the acquiring bank,

76
00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.040
the merchant's bank
provides the merchant

77
00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:33.095
those funds to complete
this particular transaction.

78
00:03:33.095 --> 00:03:37.130
Know how many different
participating institutions are

79
00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.335
required just to get

80
00:03:39.335 --> 00:03:43.070
an exchange from the card holder
to the merchant,

81
00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:46.220
for purchase of a retail good
in this setting.

82
00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.170
Compare this complexity with

83
00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.450
the simple cash transaction where

84
00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.880
the card holder has a $100 bill,

85
00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.820
and provides it to the merchant
in order to pay for

86
00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:59.220
the groceries set she requires.

87
00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.430
Perhaps unsurprising given

88
00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.000
this incredibly complicated
chain of transactions,

89
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.460
but in the United States
today we are

90
00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:10.565
far from a real time
payment system.

91
00:04:10.565 --> 00:04:12.770
This means that every piece of

92
00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:14.900
this transaction chain takes

93
00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.500
significant time in order
to settle or clear.

94
00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.320
So it takes time for
merchants to be able to get

95
00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.790
the funds that they are owed

96
00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:24.920
when consumers make transactions.

97
00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.630
It also is unclear from
the consumer's perspective,

98
00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:29.905
for the merchant's perspective,

99
00:04:29.905 --> 00:04:31.535
even the bank's perspective

100
00:04:31.535 --> 00:04:33.140
whether the funds are actually

101
00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.030
available to be dispersed at

102
00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.610
the time when
the transaction is made.

103
00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.145
This is a noted, this
is a problem that

104
00:04:40.145 --> 00:04:42.380
exists in the United
States more so

105
00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.270
than interestingly
in countries with

106
00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.330
better real-time payment
systems like China,

107
00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.790
and one that
the Federal Reserve is

108
00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.085
quite attuned to and
paying attention to.

109
00:04:52.085 --> 00:04:54.500
Recently, Lael
Brainard governor on

110
00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.470
the Federal Reserve Board
noted that consumers and

111
00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:00.050
businesses expect to
be able to send and

112
00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.825
immediately receive payments
at anytime of the day,

113
00:05:02.825 --> 00:05:04.485
on any day of the year.

114
00:05:04.485 --> 00:05:07.340
Given that our economy
is a 24/7 one,

115
00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.105
it is important for the payment
structure to be as well.

116
00:05:11.105 --> 00:05:13.730
This is why she advocates that

117
00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:15.620
the Federal Reserve
in the private sector

118
00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:16.850
come together to

119
00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:20.315
try and make investments in
real-time payments to create

120
00:05:20.315 --> 00:05:22.010
a more secure and more

121
00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:24.530
efficient payment structure
for the future.

122
00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:27.170
Most existing real-time
payment systems

123
00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:30.500
around the world offer
instantaneous 24/7,

124
00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.100
interbank electronic transfer
fund services that can

125
00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:35.780
be initiated through a variety of

126
00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.760
channels like on your smartphone,

127
00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.405
or through a digital wallet,
or through the web.

128
00:05:40.405 --> 00:05:42.135
In such a scheme,

129
00:05:42.135 --> 00:05:44.570
low value real-time
payment requests

130
00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.070
can be initiated that

131
00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:49.940
enables instantaneous
payment fund transfer,

132
00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:52.850
and a secure transaction
that can be done with

133
00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:57.030
much less complexity than
in our current scheme.
