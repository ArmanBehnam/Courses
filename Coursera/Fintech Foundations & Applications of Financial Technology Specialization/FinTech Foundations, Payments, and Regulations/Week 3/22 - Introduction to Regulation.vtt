1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.885
Typically, regulation
of payment systems

2
00:00:03.885 --> 00:00:07.140
focuses principally
on issues of first,

3
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.469
fairness, by disallowing
certain practices

4
00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.110
that feel unfair or abusive.

5
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.950
Issues of transparency,
by making the fees

6
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.750
and rates associated with credit

7
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.715
and debit cards more transparent,

8
00:00:20.715 --> 00:00:23.625
so consumers understand how
much they're actually paying,

9
00:00:23.625 --> 00:00:25.860
and consumers understand how

10
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.155
much merchants are
actually getting.

11
00:00:28.155 --> 00:00:30.255
Issues of overall risk,

12
00:00:30.255 --> 00:00:32.160
by ensuring that for example,

13
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.880
consumer credit is
appropriately allocated so that

14
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.860
systemic risk of

15
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.910
overall financial crisis
is substantially reduced.

16
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.130
Following the financial crisis,

17
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.415
there has been
quite substantial regulation

18
00:00:46.415 --> 00:00:47.870
of both debit and

19
00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.740
credit cards along the lines
of the issues of fairness,

20
00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:55.225
transparency, and systemic risks
that we've discussed.

21
00:00:55.225 --> 00:00:57.820
With respect to debit cards,

22
00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.290
in the decade leading up
to the financial crisis,

23
00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.420
the fastest growing source
of revenue for

24
00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.165
financial institutions was from

25
00:01:05.165 --> 00:01:07.910
fees that they collected
from their customers.

26
00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:10.279
These fees included for example,

27
00:01:10.279 --> 00:01:13.280
overdraft fees that are
charged to consumers

28
00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.490
who unwittingly overdraw
on their accounts.

29
00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.735
When overdraft was first
introduced as a product,

30
00:01:20.735 --> 00:01:24.380
the way that banks decided
whether they would complete

31
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.370
the transaction and charge
consumers an overdraft fee,

32
00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.440
or decline the
transaction and simply

33
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:32.975
refuse to let it be

34
00:01:32.975 --> 00:01:35.360
processed with this
payment instrument,

35
00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.040
was on a case-by-case basis

36
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.320
determined by the nature
of the consumer

37
00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.300
that they were dealing
with and also the nature

38
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.780
and size of the
transaction itself.

39
00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.190
In the decade leading
up to the crisis,

40
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.535
what banks realized
with the help of

41
00:01:48.535 --> 00:01:51.175
third-party vendors who
emerged in this space,

42
00:01:51.175 --> 00:01:52.700
was that, overdraft could be

43
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.560
a really profitable
revenue source

44
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.435
for financial institutions.

45
00:01:56.435 --> 00:01:58.970
If they instead of discouraging

46
00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.610
consumers from relying on
overdraft for example,

47
00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.350
by in some instances declining

48
00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.650
these transactions or on
a case-by-case basis,

49
00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.370
instead encouraging consumers
to turn to overdraft as

50
00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:12.980
a product with a series of

51
00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.430
practices that we now think
of as rather nefarious.

52
00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.440
For example, what became

53
00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.355
commonplace in the period
leading up to the crisis,

54
00:02:22.355 --> 00:02:24.305
was for banks to order

55
00:02:24.305 --> 00:02:26.300
your transactions in
a way that made it

56
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.305
most likely for you to incur
the maximal overdraft fees.

57
00:02:30.305 --> 00:02:32.030
For example, imagine that

58
00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.040
you wake up in
the morning and you're

59
00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.600
the kind of consumer who tends to

60
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.380
transact with your debit card
with some frequency.

61
00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.530
You start the day with $10
in your checking account,

62
00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.665
and you go to Starbucks
to buy a $5 latte.

63
00:02:44.665 --> 00:02:49.890
Then you go to let's say
IKEA to buy a $100 couch.

64
00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.180
Well, by the time you're IKEA

65
00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.279
transaction has been processed,

66
00:02:53.279 --> 00:02:55.575
you've overdrawn your account,

67
00:02:55.575 --> 00:02:57.080
which means you're liable for

68
00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.565
an overdraft fee for
your IKEA transaction.

69
00:03:00.565 --> 00:03:02.150
What banks did though and were

70
00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:03.980
able to do since we did not

71
00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.150
have and still do not have

72
00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.445
a real-time payment
structure in this country,

73
00:03:07.445 --> 00:03:10.550
is they reordered the processing
of your transactions.

74
00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.525
So they first process
your IKEA transaction,

75
00:03:13.525 --> 00:03:15.350
depleting your checking account

76
00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.300
entirely and then they

77
00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.220
process your Starbucks
transaction.

78
00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.820
So what chronologically should
be one overdraft incident,

79
00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.340
now thanks to the processing
order that the bank has

80
00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.745
selected has become two
expensive overdrafts.

81
00:03:28.745 --> 00:03:31.340
Practices like these
resulted in overdraft

82
00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.980
being a very significant
source of revenue for

83
00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.970
financial institutions and
one they relied on with

84
00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:43.045
the great success for their
debit card using customers.

85
00:03:43.045 --> 00:03:44.820
In the aftermath of the crisis,

86
00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.315
popular attention
focused significantly

87
00:03:47.315 --> 00:03:50.525
on overdraft as
a nefarious bank practice.

88
00:03:50.525 --> 00:03:52.850
There were a series of
New York Times articles

89
00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:54.590
that lamented the
fact that consumers

90
00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.480
would regularly pay $40 for

91
00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.975
their morning latte
rather than $5,

92
00:03:58.975 --> 00:04:01.515
when they incurred
a $35 overdraft fee

93
00:04:01.515 --> 00:04:04.220
attached to their
$5 debit purchase.

94
00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.200
This is again especially

95
00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.960
troubling as
a distributional matter.

96
00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.650
Only 10 percent of consumers
are responsible for

97
00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.000
around 85 percent of overdraft
revenue that's generated.

98
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.490
This means that, there are
frequent overdrafters,

99
00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:23.055
those who overdraft
with great regularity,

100
00:04:23.055 --> 00:04:25.520
tend to subsidize
the existence of things

101
00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.565
like free checking accounts
for the rest of us.

102
00:04:28.565 --> 00:04:31.980
These consumers are
disproportionately low income,

103
00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.110
less financially sophisticated,

104
00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.430
prone to the kind of mistakes
that result in overdraft.

105
00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.070
But also, mechanically more
likely to overdraft because

106
00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.985
they simply have less funds
in their checking accounts.

107
00:04:42.985 --> 00:04:45.700
Concerned about
overdraft as a practice,

108
00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.710
also related to the fact
that people simply did not

109
00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.120
realize that they were about to

110
00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.935
overdraw and bear
these expensive fees.

111
00:04:52.935 --> 00:04:56.060
Around 70 percent of customers
who were surveyed reported

112
00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.120
that they wish that these
transactions had been declined,

113
00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.320
rather than completed with
the significant overdraft fee.

114
00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.700
In response, what
regulators chose

115
00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.995
to do in the aftermath
of the crisis,

116
00:05:06.995 --> 00:05:10.040
was change the default
rules around overdraft.

117
00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.780
Prior to the financial crisis,

118
00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:13.835
100 percent of consumers
were basically

119
00:05:13.835 --> 00:05:17.150
automatically opted into
overdraft protection,

120
00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.075
as it is referred to
again rather ironically,

121
00:05:20.075 --> 00:05:22.730
which means that they're
eligible for incurring

122
00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:25.160
these overdraft fees
when they overdraw

123
00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.650
their accounts either
by transacting,

124
00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:29.690
or by withdrawing
money from the ATM,

125
00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:33.310
that they don't actually have
sufficient funds to cover.

126
00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:35.630
In the aftermath of
the crisis before

127
00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:38.810
the banks are able to levy
these overdraft fees,

128
00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:41.014
consumers are now
required to affirmatively

129
00:05:41.014 --> 00:05:43.910
opt in to banks
overdraft protection..

130
00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:46.850
This has reduced the share
of customers that are even

131
00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:50.610
capable of incurring overdraft
fees from 100 percent,

132
00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:53.249
so essentially all of
US bank customers,

133
00:05:53.249 --> 00:05:56.355
to around 15 percent
of customers,

134
00:05:56.355 --> 00:05:58.280
and decreased overdraft revenues

135
00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.840
substantially for
financial institutions.

136
00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.160
The largest financial
institutions

137
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.720
who realized that overdraft is

138
00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.150
a notorious product and
that these practices are

139
00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:11.165
frowned upon by their customers
and much more broadly,

140
00:06:11.165 --> 00:06:14.990
responded to this regulation
by embracing it and even

141
00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:18.900
going beyond the requirements
of the new default rules.

142
00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:23.270
In some instances, by
eliminating overdraft entirely

143
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:27.710
as a product and no longer
charging consumers high costs,

144
00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:31.460
instead declining these
transactions if they occur.

145
00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:35.285
Some banks offer instead
for consumers the ability

146
00:06:35.285 --> 00:06:39.085
to rewind expensive overdrafts,

147
00:06:39.085 --> 00:06:42.860
not charging consumers
a high overdraft fee if they're

148
00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:46.930
able to replenish
their accounts within 24 hours,

149
00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:50.710
and cover the cost of the
transaction that they had made.

150
00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:54.230
Concerned observers of
the debit card industry

151
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:56.120
and overdraft in particular,

152
00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:57.795
suggests that the new opt in

153
00:06:57.795 --> 00:07:00.305
rules haven't actually
gone far enough.

154
00:07:00.305 --> 00:07:01.610
This is a point made by

155
00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:04.100
legal academics
like Lauren Willis,

156
00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:06.335
Ryan Bubb, and Richard Pildes.

157
00:07:06.335 --> 00:07:09.880
These academics point out that,

158
00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:12.335
if you look to see
the consumers who have

159
00:07:12.335 --> 00:07:16.010
affirmatively opted into
banks overdraft protection,

160
00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:18.060
they are disproportionately
the low-income,

161
00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:20.510
less financially
sophisticated consumers,

162
00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:21.590
who tended to generate

163
00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:24.880
the most overdraft revenue
in the previous era.

164
00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:28.950
The interpretation of these
legal academics of this fact,

165
00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:30.965
is that financial
institutions are

166
00:07:30.965 --> 00:07:33.965
aggressively targeting
low income consumers

167
00:07:33.965 --> 00:07:36.650
for opting into overdraft
because these are

168
00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:37.880
the consumers that actually

169
00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:40.375
generate overdraft revenue
for the bank.

170
00:07:40.375 --> 00:07:43.460
An alternative explanation
for the fact that

171
00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:47.059
these customers tend to opt
in to overdraft protection,

172
00:07:47.059 --> 00:07:49.010
is that these customers simply

173
00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:51.260
like overdraft as a product and

174
00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.570
appreciate the ability
to be able to complete

175
00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:55.850
their transactions without having

176
00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:58.290
to find another means of payment,

177
00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:00.050
things like going
to a payday lender

178
00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:02.475
to be able to withdraw
the funds they need,

179
00:08:02.475 --> 00:08:05.645
to let say get groceries for
their children that evening.

180
00:08:05.645 --> 00:08:08.075
The series of critics around

181
00:08:08.075 --> 00:08:11.460
overdraft protection that
Bubb, Pildes, Willis,

182
00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:13.715
set of critiques advocate that

183
00:08:13.715 --> 00:08:16.790
essentially in the new
overdraft default rules,

184
00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:20.315
you're pitting very sophisticated
financial institutions

185
00:08:20.315 --> 00:08:22.940
against unsophisticated
consumers.

186
00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:26.155
So no matter what
default rules you set,

187
00:08:26.155 --> 00:08:28.700
the large financial institutions
are inevitably going to

188
00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:29.990
prevail because they are

189
00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:32.930
much more sophisticated actors
in this setting.

190
00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:36.035
These academics suggest that
what we need in overdraft

191
00:08:36.035 --> 00:08:39.475
is to ban this predatory
practice altogether,

192
00:08:39.475 --> 00:08:41.990
and instead no longer
allow banks to

193
00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:44.540
offer overdraft protection
for consumers,

194
00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:48.769
since there are
other cheaper alternatives

195
00:08:48.769 --> 00:08:51.905
available to consumers to
get access to these funds,

196
00:08:51.905 --> 00:08:54.589
albeit alternatives that
might be less desirable

197
00:08:54.589 --> 00:08:58.240
because they take longer
to try and initiate,

198
00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:59.900
things like calling
up your bank and

199
00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:02.575
setting up an overdraft
line of credit.

200
00:09:02.575 --> 00:09:04.625
An alternative to the approach

201
00:09:04.625 --> 00:09:07.040
advocated by critics
of overdraft who say

202
00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:08.960
that the default rules
haven't gone far enough

203
00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:11.195
and we should ban
the product altogether,

204
00:09:11.195 --> 00:09:13.790
is to simply alert consumers to

205
00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:16.430
the high cost of overdrafting in

206
00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:18.740
the moment before
they actually make

207
00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:21.905
the decision to bear
an overdraft fee.

208
00:09:21.905 --> 00:09:24.019
We know that disclosure generally

209
00:09:24.019 --> 00:09:26.060
tends to be complicated and

210
00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:31.295
less useful as an intervention
with respect to consumers.

211
00:09:31.295 --> 00:09:33.440
Because no one really reads

212
00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:37.220
their long contract with
a financial institution,

213
00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:40.580
which lists on Page 28 of

214
00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:44.690
37 that they're likely to
bear an overdraft fee of $30,

215
00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:46.805
if they overdraft their account.

216
00:09:46.805 --> 00:09:49.780
So that kind of disclosure is
not going to be effective,

217
00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:51.140
but the kind of disclosure that

218
00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:52.910
can be effective is alerting

219
00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:54.740
consumers when they're inline

220
00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:56.825
buying their Starbucks
in the morning,

221
00:09:56.825 --> 00:09:58.070
that if they complete

222
00:09:58.070 --> 00:10:00.290
this transaction with
their debit card there in

223
00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:03.965
fact likely to incur
a $35 overdraft fee.

224
00:10:03.965 --> 00:10:05.540
Since consumers who bear

225
00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:07.940
overdraft fees disproportionately
report that they

226
00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:09.620
would rather those
transactions had been

227
00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:11.900
declined than
completed with a fee,

228
00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:14.060
this would discourage
overdrafting

229
00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:16.250
by the consumers who
don't actually want

230
00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:18.380
to complete those transactions
and would prefer

231
00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:20.540
to pay with a different
means of payment,

232
00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:22.670
or not get their latte
that morning at all,

233
00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:24.815
but still allow
the availability of

234
00:10:24.815 --> 00:10:27.005
overdraft for consumers
who rely on it

235
00:10:27.005 --> 00:10:29.300
as a means of being
able to complete

236
00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:32.380
purchases that they wouldn't
be able to otherwise.

237
00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:34.880
I call this approach a salience

238
00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:37.145
shock for consumers
and have in mind

239
00:10:37.145 --> 00:10:39.560
a text message that
you would receive when

240
00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:41.990
you're in that line at
Starbucks telling you that,

241
00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:43.760
"If you pay with
your debit card and complete

242
00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:44.930
this transaction is going to

243
00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:47.300
charge a high overdraft fee."

244
00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:49.580
I have reason to believe
that this will be

245
00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:52.505
an effective way of discouraging
overdraft incidence.

246
00:10:52.505 --> 00:10:55.370
In the UK, they've
adopted such an approach,

247
00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:58.370
where they alert consumers
via text message when

248
00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:00.125
their account balances
are getting low and

249
00:11:00.125 --> 00:11:02.510
overdraft fees are
likely to be incurred,

250
00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:04.460
and they find that
this approach decreases

251
00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:09.900
overdraft incidence by
around 25 percent for consumers.
