1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.710
Given the substantial concerns
about the fairness of

2
00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.500
payment markets both
to consumers who

3
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.470
don't tend to transact
with rewards cards,

4
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:12.390
also to merchants
who tend to bear

5
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.060
high fees for processing
these transactions,

6
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:16.715
as well as general concerns

7
00:00:16.715 --> 00:00:19.010
about the efficiency
of transacting with

8
00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:20.720
these payment instruments given

9
00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.580
how complicated the series of

10
00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.010
transactions is required to

11
00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:27.620
actually settle and clear
these transactions,

12
00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.290
as well as general concerns
about, for example,

13
00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:33.180
consumer fraud that we spent
less time talking about,

14
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.580
but of course are implicated in

15
00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.770
situations when
consumers transact with

16
00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.810
payment instruments and provide

17
00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:42.530
their credit card information
to e-commerce platforms and

18
00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.050
merchants more broadly
in ways that allow for

19
00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:46.670
that information
to potentially be

20
00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.760
stolen and fraudulently used.

21
00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.180
So given this myriad problems

22
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.665
that exist in these markets,

23
00:00:52.665 --> 00:00:55.280
there is of course
tremendous potential for

24
00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.045
new financial technologies to
come in as real disruptors.

25
00:00:59.045 --> 00:01:02.210
Incidentally,
the existence of credit

26
00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.540
and debit cards as a means
of payment are in and of

27
00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.370
itself earlier examples of

28
00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.890
financial technology
innovations that moved

29
00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.470
us away from less efficient
means of transacting,

30
00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.290
for example, with cash and check.

31
00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.090
So here we are, we're now
innovating further as we think

32
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.920
towards what the future holds

33
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.680
for financial transactions
more broadly.

34
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.150
This is a space that

35
00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.700
large financial institutions
are actually spending

36
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.340
traditional financial
institutions are

37
00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.175
spending significant
energy investing in.

38
00:01:34.175 --> 00:01:35.630
As you'll see, here these are

39
00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.150
massive investments by
the likes of Goldman Sachs,

40
00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.560
Citi, JPMorgan, Bank of
America and many others.

41
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.105
Of course, the existence

42
00:01:44.105 --> 00:01:47.450
of digital assets like
Bitcoin as a means of

43
00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.030
transacting may well play into

44
00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.795
the future of financial
technologies around payments,

45
00:01:53.795 --> 00:01:56.330
as may well digital platforms

46
00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.415
for things like
peer-to-peer lending which

47
00:01:58.415 --> 00:02:00.320
allow credit needs that consumers

48
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.275
have to be met quickly
through transacting,

49
00:02:03.275 --> 00:02:06.830
for example, through a
financial technology app

50
00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.360
rather than by having

51
00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.950
to go to a traditional
lender or a bank

52
00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.865
to be able to take out
some of these loans.

53
00:02:13.865 --> 00:02:16.415
I want to conclude with
just a few examples

54
00:02:16.415 --> 00:02:18.560
on around payment innovation.

55
00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.679
We talked a little bit about
stores like Starbucks,

56
00:02:21.679 --> 00:02:25.165
who are creating payment apps
to avoid credit swipe fees.

57
00:02:25.165 --> 00:02:27.480
Additionally,
technologies like Ripple,

58
00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.090
which allow for consumers to

59
00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.190
send money globally
using the power of

60
00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.700
blockchain in a way
that is secure and has

61
00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.530
fewer payments attached to it

62
00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.740
than traditional
remittance technologies.

63
00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.190
As well as low or
no cost applications that allow

64
00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.460
for consumers to be able to
pay bills and make purchases,

65
00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.070
transfer money to
other user and make

66
00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.065
payments stores through
the use of their smartphones.

67
00:02:53.065 --> 00:02:56.140
Of course, as all this
technology is developed,

68
00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.899
it is becoming easier to
transact and cheaper to transact

69
00:02:59.899 --> 00:03:01.730
through the use of
your digital platform

70
00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.025
like your iPhone or your Android.

71
00:03:04.025 --> 00:03:05.360
There's a concern that some of

72
00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.700
these technologies may
disadvantage those who don't

73
00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.980
have access to
smartphones to be able to

74
00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.880
complete their transactions
in this manner.

75
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.460
Of course, this is not a reason
to discourage innovation,

76
00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:18.020
but rather a reason
to think about

77
00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.700
the distributional
effects of some

78
00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.120
of these technological
advancements and how

79
00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.670
it's possible to use
the leverage the power of

80
00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.730
technology to make
financial technology more

81
00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.250
broadly available to
consumers who don't

82
00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.960
currently have access to some
of these great innovations.

83
00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.530
Looking forward, there are

84
00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.380
several questions that we
must think about as we think

85
00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.555
through both the structure
of payments and

86
00:03:41.555 --> 00:03:44.630
also how best to
intervene as regulators,

87
00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.805
as policymakers, as academics is

88
00:03:46.805 --> 00:03:50.585
interested consumers
in this space.

89
00:03:50.585 --> 00:03:52.220
One is, should payments be

90
00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.260
regulated in a way
that's distinct than

91
00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:55.520
they're regulated today and

92
00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.620
particularly should we
try and think about

93
00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.900
some global framework for

94
00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.280
financial regulation in
this particular manner?

95
00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.600
The other is, what exactly does

96
00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.670
the future of payments
look like and what are

97
00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.130
the best ways that
technology can help make

98
00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:13.550
these transactions happen
seamlessly and securely,

99
00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.530
and advantage both consumers and

100
00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.385
merchants in these markets?

101
00:04:18.385 --> 00:04:21.320
Finally, how do we
think about engaging

102
00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.885
with the kind of
security risks of

103
00:04:23.885 --> 00:04:27.410
payment innovations when
you are transacting on

104
00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.120
your phone for every purchase

105
00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.770
you make in your day-to-day life.

106
00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.150
Do you worry about what

107
00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:33.800
happens and how do we
make sure that you're

108
00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.825
secure information
is not going to be

109
00:04:35.825 --> 00:04:38.140
easily stolen by
those around you?

110
00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:39.890
Of course, like bio-metric

111
00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:42.409
are two-factor
authentication devices

112
00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:44.660
are being considered as

113
00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.970
solutions to many
of these problems.
