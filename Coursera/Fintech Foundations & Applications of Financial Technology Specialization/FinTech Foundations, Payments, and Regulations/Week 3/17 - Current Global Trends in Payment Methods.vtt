1
00:00:01.543 --> 00:00:06.406
It wasn't too long ago that check was
the most common non-cash form of payment.

2
00:00:06.406 --> 00:00:11.793
In the early 1990s, almost 90% of non-cash
transactions were done with check.

3
00:00:11.793 --> 00:00:16.286
Checks have declined significantly over
the last three decades, as debit and

4
00:00:16.286 --> 00:00:19.310
credit card usage has really exploded.

5
00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.560
Cash is still the most common means
of purchase in the US, however,

6
00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.440
its share is declining quickly.

7
00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.420
And by 2022, we anticipate that

8
00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.010
there's going to be a growth in new kinds
of payment instruments, like eWallets,

9
00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.690
that FinTech technologies
are developing continuously.

10
00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.040
There are interesting distributional
aspects to who transacts with

11
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.950
what kind of payment instrument.

12
00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.540
Cash is predominantly used
by low-income consumers,

13
00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.860
often who don't have access to credit
cards as a mean of transacting.

14
00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.860
Debit cards are most commonly
used by low and middle-income

15
00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.880
consumers who have access to a debit
card because they have a bank account.

16
00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.870
But don't transact with credit either
because they don't have a credit card.

17
00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:07.290
Or because they don't feel comfortable
transacting with means of payment that

18
00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.680
couples borrowing from a bank or
a financial institution with transacting.

19
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.450
Credit cards are predominantly used
by higher-income consumers who have

20
00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.830
access to really attractive rewards cards
and use them as a means of purchase.

21
00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.110
Since the financial crisis, debit usage
has actually dominated credit usage.

22
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.624
One reason that people think this may
be is because especially millennial

23
00:01:32.624 --> 00:01:36.336
consumers are still operating
in the shadow of the crisis and

24
00:01:36.336 --> 00:01:39.337
worry about taking on too
much credit card debt.

25
00:01:39.337 --> 00:01:44.972
However, in the future, going forward, the
belief is that credit will dominate debit.

26
00:01:44.972 --> 00:01:48.056
And that new payment instruments,
like eWallets and

27
00:01:48.056 --> 00:01:52.470
Apple Pay, are really going to
dominate the payment landscape.

28
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.580
What's really quite interesting about
credit card and debit card payment

29
00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:04.130
networks is that a few large card networks
tend to dominate the global landscape.

30
00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:10.096
So here in the US, over 90% of credit
card volume is dominated by Visa,

31
00:02:10.096 --> 00:02:13.192
MasterCard, and American Express.

32
00:02:13.192 --> 00:02:17.416
Visa and MasterCard, significantly
larger share than American Express,

33
00:02:17.416 --> 00:02:20.570
account for around 70% of the total.

34
00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.960
Overall across the globe,
Visa, MasterCard, and

35
00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.264
UnionPay dominate the global
payment landscape.

36
00:02:29.264 --> 00:02:34.277
UnionPay, you may not have heard of,
it's a payment processor that

37
00:02:34.277 --> 00:02:39.471
was established in China and
has a true monopoly on the Chinese market.

38
00:02:39.471 --> 00:02:45.810
For many years, Visa and MasterCard cards
in China were dual-badged with UnionPay.

39
00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.940
But a 2017 regulation prohibited
this dual-badging going forward.

40
00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.790
As all Chinese cards issued for domestic
use now have to be UnionPay-branded and

41
00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.810
banks are typically issuing
UnionPay-only cards.

42
00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:00.720
This means Visa and

43
00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.350
MasterCard's ability to compete in the
Chinese market has all but been depleted.

44
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.968
As the Chinese appetite for
tourism has grown substantially,

45
00:03:08.968 --> 00:03:12.800
so has the number of countries
where UnionPay cards are accepted.

46
00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.049
Today, these cards can be
used in over 150 countries,

47
00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:20.570
even though those of us who transact
in the US have likely never seen them.

48
00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.670
Here in the US since the early 2000s,
we've witnessed a substantial decline in

49
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.540
the use of checks as
a means of transacting.

50
00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.650
That decline has been picked up by
a substantial growth in credit cards and

51
00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.330
debit cards as a means of purchase.

52
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:35.547
Since the recession,

53
00:03:35.547 --> 00:03:39.720
there's also been a growth in prepaid
debit cards as a means of transacting.

54
00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.508
Prepaid debit cards allow consumers
who either don't have bank accounts or

55
00:03:44.508 --> 00:03:48.919
who have bank accounts but don't want
to transact on them to prepay and

56
00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:50.290
purchase a card.

57
00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:56.120
For example, from Walmart, and then use
that prepaid debit card as a means of,

58
00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.760
for example, paying for
gas with their debit card.

59
00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:05.290
Today in the US, around 67% of
transactions are made with debit cards,

60
00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.790
and around 33% of card transactions
are made with credit cards.

61
00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.805
Again, the distributional aspects of
this are really quite interesting.

62
00:04:13.805 --> 00:04:18.740
High-income financially sophisticated
consumers disproportionately use credit

63
00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:22.712
cards as a means of transacting
primarily to get access to attractive

64
00:04:22.712 --> 00:04:24.985
rewards that card issuers offer them.

65
00:04:24.985 --> 00:04:28.941
Low-income consumers, who either don't
have access to credit or don't trust

66
00:04:28.941 --> 00:04:32.607
that they're going to be able to monitor
their credit in an appropriate way,

67
00:04:32.607 --> 00:04:35.240
tend to transact much
more with debit cards.

68
00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.069
It's also true that for larger
transactions consumers are much more

69
00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:41.849
likely to use credit cards
as a means of purchase.

70
00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:45.990
And for smaller transactions, consumers
are much more likely to use debit cards.

71
00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.840
The financial crisis was really
a quite interesting inflection point

72
00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.740
from the perspective
of the payment system.

73
00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.206
In the decade leading up to the crisis,

74
00:04:56.206 --> 00:05:00.920
credit card use really quite exploded
as card networks introduced rewards

75
00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:04.687
cards that incentivized
consumers to transact with them.

76
00:05:04.687 --> 00:05:06.297
Following the crisis,

77
00:05:06.297 --> 00:05:11.461
there's been a real substantial growth
in debit relative to credit usage.

78
00:05:11.461 --> 00:05:16.336
Particularly for a certain class of
consumers, precisely millennials,

79
00:05:16.336 --> 00:05:18.355
who lived through the crisis.

80
00:05:18.355 --> 00:05:23.478
There appears to be a bit of a distrust
with respect to using credit cards that

81
00:05:23.478 --> 00:05:29.096
couple transacting and financial borrowing
from large financial institutions.

82
00:05:29.096 --> 00:05:33.889
Around 70% of millennials tend to
believe that debit cards are as safe or

83
00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:38.619
safer than credit cards and
prefer transacting with these instruments.

84
00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:44.328
It's also unclear what new regulations
that make it more expensive for

85
00:05:44.328 --> 00:05:48.491
banks to supply credit have done
to credit card usage in the US.

86
00:05:48.491 --> 00:05:53.242
A 2013 report by the feds suggested
that the loss of around 120 million

87
00:05:53.242 --> 00:05:56.385
credit card accounts,
following the recession,

88
00:05:56.385 --> 00:06:01.880
might tell us that consumers are choosing
to reduce the number of cards they hold.

89
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:07.590
And presumably choosing to transact
with fewer credit cards in the future.

90
00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:11.458
But this could also be that consumers
are simply adjusting the number of cards

91
00:06:11.458 --> 00:06:12.062
they hold.

92
00:06:12.062 --> 00:06:17.094
Or banks are adjusting the availability of
credit to certain categories of consumers,

93
00:06:17.094 --> 00:06:21.174
but not in a way that's going to have
a substantial impact on the means they

94
00:06:21.174 --> 00:06:21.861
transact.

95
00:06:21.861 --> 00:06:27.723
The three years following the crisis,
from around 2012 to 2015,

96
00:06:27.723 --> 00:06:32.700
were the largest growth in credit
usage in the decade prior.

97
00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:36.970
Which suggests that overall credit usage
in terms of volume is growing quite

98
00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:38.300
substantially.

99
00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:42.733
Even though there are certain classes of
consumers who tend to be a little bit

100
00:06:42.733 --> 00:06:45.725
wary about transacting
with credit instruments.
