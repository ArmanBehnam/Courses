1
00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:03.930
In addition to the complexity of

2
00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:06.525
these series of transactions
that we've outlined,

3
00:00:06.525 --> 00:00:09.015
another problem in
the payment system

4
00:00:09.015 --> 00:00:10.500
is that there tends to be

5
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.035
a substantial cost burden
for merchants

6
00:00:13.035 --> 00:00:16.305
at various points in
this transaction chain.

7
00:00:16.305 --> 00:00:19.710
Let's go back to our initial
transaction for groceries

8
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.055
to try and understand the nature
of fees in this setting.

9
00:00:23.055 --> 00:00:24.710
Remember that the cardholder,

10
00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.550
the consumer here is buying a

11
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.550
$100 of groceries
from a merchant.

12
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.050
You would think and if

13
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.580
that transaction was
happening with cash,

14
00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:35.480
that would mean that
the merchant gets a

15
00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.245
$100 for a $100 of groceries.

16
00:00:38.245 --> 00:00:40.575
In this setting though
that's not true,

17
00:00:40.575 --> 00:00:45.050
the merchant agrees to accept
a sum less than a $100 for

18
00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.180
that transaction
because it has to

19
00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.850
pay a fee for processing.

20
00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.160
It initially pays a fee to

21
00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.875
its own bank if
the acquiring bank,

22
00:00:54.875 --> 00:00:56.210
that's on the order of,

23
00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.805
let's say, two and half percent.

24
00:00:58.805 --> 00:01:03.020
This is known as a merchant
discount fee which is kind

25
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.730
of an ironic name given that

26
00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.040
the merchant is
bearing this cost.

27
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.280
The acquiring bank then
pays the card network,

28
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.110
in this setting master card,

29
00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.150
a small fee for processing
this transaction and

30
00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.340
for providing
furnishing the funds

31
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.070
from the issuing bank
to the acquiring bank.

32
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.250
The issuing bank also
pays the card network a

33
00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.040
small fee for completing
this transaction,

34
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.980
and the acquiring bank pays
the issuing bank directly in

35
00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.470
the form of
an interchange fee for

36
00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.485
this transaction being processed.

37
00:01:39.485 --> 00:01:41.810
All in all, these fees can total

38
00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.820
between one and three percent of

39
00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.060
total transaction value
for merchants or at

40
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.444
least did historically in the US

41
00:01:49.444 --> 00:01:53.735
before recent regulation
restricted the ability of

42
00:01:53.735 --> 00:01:57.390
banks to levy debit
interchange fees on

43
00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.720
merchants though credit
card interchange

44
00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.850
has been left unregulated.

45
00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.295
What's quite interesting is that

46
00:02:04.295 --> 00:02:06.695
interchange fees tend to vary

47
00:02:06.695 --> 00:02:09.170
depending on
the card network and the

48
00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.975
kind of payment instrument
that's being used.

49
00:02:11.975 --> 00:02:13.640
So historically,

50
00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.730
debit interchange fees
tend to be lower than

51
00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.130
credit card interchange fees with

52
00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.595
pin debit having
the lowest processing costs.

53
00:02:22.595 --> 00:02:25.175
Credit card fees
tend to be higher.

54
00:02:25.175 --> 00:02:28.550
An American Express credit
card interchange fees

55
00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.095
tend to be the highest,

56
00:02:30.095 --> 00:02:34.220
because their business model
involves recruiting

57
00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.250
customers who are
high value customers

58
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.890
from the perspective of
merchants, those who are wealthy,

59
00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.570
those who transact frequently on

60
00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.110
their cards and encouraging
these cardholders to use

61
00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.720
their transaction instrument
through a series of

62
00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.790
incredibly attractive
rewards even

63
00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.940
relative to its card
network competitors.

64
00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.745
It is striking that
in the United States,

65
00:02:55.745 --> 00:02:57.470
merchants can pay let's say,

66
00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.450
$3 of a $100 transaction in
the form of processing fees

67
00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.210
to financial institutions
and card networks.

68
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:11.540
In response to these really
quite high fees that they

69
00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.340
bear as we've discussed

70
00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.120
often their second highest cost
of operating after labor,

71
00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.090
many merchants respond
by simply saying they

72
00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.135
won't accept certain
kinds of cards or

73
00:03:23.135 --> 00:03:25.970
having a minimum required
amount before they're

74
00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.660
willing to process a debit
or credit transaction.

75
00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.030
The high cost associated with

76
00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.930
payment processing suggests
an opportunity for

77
00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.420
financial technology
companies that use

78
00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.540
e-payment services to come
in and usefully disrupt

79
00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.865
the industry and benefit

80
00:03:43.865 --> 00:03:47.730
merchants by creating
a lower-cost processing system,

81
00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.680
but also, consumers by
eliminating the inconvenience of

82
00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.810
card minimums being required

83
00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.720
in order to complete
transactions.

84
00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.150
Some innovators in
this space include

85
00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.415
large merchants like Starbucks.

86
00:04:01.415 --> 00:04:03.890
Rather than having to
bear a processing fee

87
00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.189
every time a consumer
goes and buys a latte,

88
00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:09.650
what Starbucks has done
is essentially created

89
00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.410
an app where consumers buy
a gift card let's say,

90
00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.435
$50 or a $100 gift card

91
00:04:14.435 --> 00:04:18.380
and keep that gift card
on their consumer wallet.

92
00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.170
That means that Starbucks
now only has to pay

93
00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:22.760
a processing fee every time you

94
00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.220
reload or purchase
a new gift card,

95
00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.505
rather than every time you
go and buy your latte.

96
00:04:28.505 --> 00:04:30.640
Other innovators include Venmo,

97
00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.600
which is a mobile app
that was first used

98
00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.860
for sending cash
quickly to other users,

99
00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.890
but is now used to pay merchants

100
00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:39.635
without exorbitant
processing fees.

101
00:04:39.635 --> 00:04:41.690
PayStand is an example of

102
00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.900
a cloud-based billing and
payment platform that's trying

103
00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.870
to improve payments
between businesses

104
00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.290
and reduce these transaction
fees substantially.

105
00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:53.940
The point that
the founder of PayStand,

106
00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.490
Jeremy Almond makes sort
of quite profoundly,

107
00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.690
is that in this movement toward

108
00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.080
a cashless society that
seeks to more efficiently

109
00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.910
allow consumers and merchants to

110
00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:07.070
transact with payment instruments

111
00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:08.530
like credit and debit cards,

112
00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.280
it will be imperative to move

113
00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.320
away from high processing fees

114
00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.135
that tend to inhibit the growth

115
00:05:14.135 --> 00:05:16.610
of these particular platforms.

116
00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.030
This requires a substantial
investment in technology for

117
00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:22.190
decentralized networks that will

118
00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.170
allow merchants to
receive their funds,

119
00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:27.080
but not require a substantial
penalty in the form of

120
00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:32.040
a high processing fee for
these particular transactions.
