00:00:01.667 --> 00:00:06.772
In the decade leading up to the financial
crisis, there was a significant

2
00:00:06.772 --> 00:00:12.226
growth in the use of credit and debit
cards as a means of transacting for goods.

3
00:00:12.226 --> 00:00:17.008
Part of that is because these transaction
instruments simply became more

4
00:00:17.008 --> 00:00:21.878
attractive for consumers as these
networks developed and became larger.

5
00:00:21.878 --> 00:00:26.392
As more merchants were accepting credit
and debit cards, consumers enjoyed

6
00:00:26.392 --> 00:00:30.639
transacting with them and the ease and
convenience associated with it.

7
00:00:30.639 --> 00:00:36.022
What card networks and financial
institutions realized that they could do,

8
00:00:36.022 --> 00:00:40.243
and did successfully in the decade
leading up to the crisis,

9
00:00:40.243 --> 00:00:44.549
is introduce sort of new payment
instruments rather than just

10
00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:49.387
the standard credit cards they
offered in the form of rewards cards.

11
00:00:49.387 --> 00:00:54.531
These rewards cards encouraged
transactions by providing consumers

12
00:00:54.531 --> 00:01:00.370
incentives to use these particular
instruments, things like airline miles or

13
00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.390
cash back for
completing significant transactions.

14
00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.383
Something we as consumers
don't spend that much time

15
00:01:08.383 --> 00:01:12.463
thinking about is why exactly it is or
who exactly bears

16
00:01:12.463 --> 00:01:17.444
the cost associated with the attractive
rewards that we receive.

17
00:01:17.444 --> 00:01:22.070
You may think that it's financial
institutions and car networks who have to

18
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.837
compete for our business by
offering us attractive rewards.

19
00:01:25.837 --> 00:01:29.116
And to a certain extent,
that's of course true.

20
00:01:29.116 --> 00:01:34.274
But in reality, a large portion of
the credit card rewards that we receive

21
00:01:34.274 --> 00:01:39.265
are actually borne by less sophisticated,
lower income consumers who

22
00:01:39.265 --> 00:01:44.524
don't have access to, or who don't
transact with rewards instruments.

23
00:01:44.524 --> 00:01:49.210
In the United States, there are
significant barriers to merchants' ability

24
00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:50.843
to set different prices for

25
00:01:50.843 --> 00:01:55.395
different consumers depending on
the kind of payment instrument they use.

26
00:01:55.395 --> 00:01:57.468
When a consumer transacts with cash,

27
00:01:57.468 --> 00:02:00.918
there is no processing fee
associated with that transaction.

28
00:02:00.918 --> 00:02:02.696
For $100 of groceries,

29
00:02:02.696 --> 00:02:07.003
your grocer receives the full $100
bill that you provide to her.

30
00:02:07.003 --> 00:02:11.348
When a consumer transacts with
a credit card or a debit card,

31
00:02:11.348 --> 00:02:15.607
the grocer receives only a portion,
as we've discussed,

32
00:02:15.607 --> 00:02:18.518
of that total $100 as in her pocket.

33
00:02:18.518 --> 00:02:22.622
And pays out a significant sum,
often on the order of $3 or more,

34
00:02:22.622 --> 00:02:27.629
to financial institutions and card
networks for processing this transaction.

35
00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:28.840
Of those $3,

36
00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.623
let's say you the consumer receive
$1 in terms of rewards as cashback.

37
00:02:34.623 --> 00:02:40.526
This means that for your $100 groceries,
you actually only paid something

38
00:02:40.526 --> 00:02:46.006
like $99 for that transaction and
the merchant only received $97.

39
00:02:46.006 --> 00:02:50.313
Yet for a cash user,
the merchant receives the full 100.

40
00:02:50.313 --> 00:02:55.695
And the merchant has no ability, really,
to charge you, the card user, an extra

41
00:02:55.695 --> 00:03:00.936
$3 for using a more expensive payment
instrument, for a variety of reasons.

42
00:03:00.936 --> 00:03:05.833
One reason is because card networks
created actual barriers to the ability of

43
00:03:05.833 --> 00:03:10.524
merchants to up-charge consumers for
more expensive means of payment.

44
00:03:10.524 --> 00:03:15.981
Although merchants are allowed to
provide cash discounts to consumers for

45
00:03:15.981 --> 00:03:20.658
transacting with cash,
historically it was very difficult for

46
00:03:20.658 --> 00:03:23.775
them to charge higher fees for
card users or

47
00:03:23.775 --> 00:03:28.291
highest fees for card users who
used expensive rewards card.

48
00:03:28.291 --> 00:03:32.752
As a result of a 2013 settlement
between Visa and MasterCard and

49
00:03:32.752 --> 00:03:37.603
a group of merchants, they're now
sort of technically able to surcharge

50
00:03:37.603 --> 00:03:42.235
consumers who are using expensive
forms of payment for transacting.

51
00:03:42.235 --> 00:03:47.564
However, in reality, there still exists
a variety of legislative barriers,

52
00:03:47.564 --> 00:03:52.732
like rules in 11 states that explicitly
ban the practice of charging higher

53
00:03:52.732 --> 00:03:57.598
prices to consumers for the use of
more expensive payment instruments.

54
00:03:57.598 --> 00:04:01.761
This means that practically merchants
have very little ability to

55
00:04:01.761 --> 00:04:06.383
charge different prices for those who
use more expensive rewards cards.

56
00:04:06.383 --> 00:04:11.621
And in response what they do is simply
increase the costs of retail goods

57
00:04:11.621 --> 00:04:17.036
across the board for all consumers to
cover the cost of processing fees for

58
00:04:17.036 --> 00:04:20.465
the few of us who transact
with rewards cards.

59
00:04:20.465 --> 00:04:24.343
Or in the very extreme,
it means that airline miles for

60
00:04:24.343 --> 00:04:27.548
sort of billionaires
like Warren Buffett and

61
00:04:27.548 --> 00:04:31.765
Mark Zuckerberg are being
subsidized by a cash payments and

62
00:04:31.765 --> 00:04:36.260
food stamps payments by very low
income consumers amongst us.

63
00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.341
In recent work, the Federal Reserve Bank
of Boston has made this point quite

64
00:04:40.341 --> 00:04:42.400
explicitly and tried to quantify it.

65
00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.981
They point out that on average,
every cash-using household pays

66
00:04:46.981 --> 00:04:50.841
around $151 annually to
card-using households.

67
00:04:50.841 --> 00:04:55.729
And each card-using household
receives around $1,500 from cash

68
00:04:55.729 --> 00:05:00.375
users every year in the form of
a transfer through their ability to get

69
00:05:00.375 --> 00:05:02.554
access to attractive rewards.

70
00:05:02.554 --> 00:05:07.392
This in essence is an incredibly
regressive transfer from low

71
00:05:07.392 --> 00:05:10.189
income to high income households.

72
00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:14.908
The legislative fixes for this sort of
transfer are a little bit complicated and

73
00:05:14.908 --> 00:05:17.523
perhaps not politically that attractive.

74
00:05:17.523 --> 00:05:21.796
Sort of the most extreme solution
that we could imagine is we

75
00:05:21.796 --> 00:05:26.068
could simply ban loyalty rewards
programs all together and

76
00:05:26.068 --> 00:05:29.836
get rid of your airline miles or
your 2% cash back.

77
00:05:29.836 --> 00:05:33.958
Perhaps a more politically
palatable solution to this

78
00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:38.619
regressive transfer would be
focusing on making it easier for

79
00:05:38.619 --> 00:05:43.371
merchants to charge differential
pricing to consumers who use

80
00:05:43.371 --> 00:05:48.048
differentially expensive
payment instruments to process.

81
00:05:48.048 --> 00:05:52.243
That way when you use your American
Express at your local grocery store,

82
00:05:52.243 --> 00:05:56.713
you can make the decision of whether
the 2% extra you'll be charged in order

83
00:05:56.713 --> 00:06:01.186
to cover the processing fees for that
transaction are actually outweighed by

84
00:06:01.186 --> 00:06:04.318
attractive awards that
you're going to be offered.

85
00:06:04.318 --> 00:06:09.083
You, the consumer that's causing the
merchant bear the extra processing fee,

86
00:06:09.083 --> 00:06:13.635
are the one who has to make the decision
about whether you want to pay that extra

87
00:06:13.635 --> 00:06:16.719
processing fee rather than
unfairly the processing

88
00:06:16.719 --> 00:06:19.733
fee associated with your
transaction being spread

89
00:06:19.733 --> 00:06:23.899
out across consumers who aren't
receiving the rewards that you are.
