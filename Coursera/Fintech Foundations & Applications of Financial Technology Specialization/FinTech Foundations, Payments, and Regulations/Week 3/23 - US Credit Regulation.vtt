00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:04.170
A concern in the credit
card market that

2
00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.870
emerged well before
the financial crisis,

3
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.585
was the fact that
consumers tended to bear

4
00:00:09.585 --> 00:00:14.160
high delinquency fees for
missing payments on credit,

5
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.065
missing their credit
card payments,

6
00:00:16.065 --> 00:00:18.600
and that financial
institutions tended

7
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.480
to without fair warning,

8
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.350
increase the interest rates
that consumers owed them in

9
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.370
a way that felt unfair
to particular consumers.

10
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:32.660
These are problems that
Elizabeth Warren highlighted in

11
00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.730
2007 in her call

12
00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.640
for a Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau.

13
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.850
Warren used to
really terrific analogy

14
00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.120
comparing a toaster
to consumer credit,

15
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.960
or home mortgages for example,

16
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.520
and pointed out that while
there were institutions in

17
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.684
place to make sure that
your toaster didn't explode,

18
00:00:52.684 --> 00:00:54.380
there were far less institutions

19
00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:55.850
in place to make sure that

20
00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.230
you weren't receiving a mortgage

21
00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.240
that you wouldn't
be able to repay,

22
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.410
or you weren't being given

23
00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.870
credit card debt at
a certain price,

24
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.000
without realizing that
that price didn't

25
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.685
include all of
the various fees and

26
00:01:07.685 --> 00:01:09.140
interest rate hikes
that you would

27
00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.860
experience over the lifetime
of your credit card account.

28
00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.804
In the aftermath of
the financial crisis,

29
00:01:15.804 --> 00:01:17.960
there was substantial
political ability

30
00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.520
to navigate this sphere,

31
00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.200
and impose new regulations on

32
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.240
the financial institutions
that had been

33
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.245
responsible for
the calamity of the crisis.

34
00:01:27.245 --> 00:01:29.510
One of the first pieces
of legislation that

35
00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.600
Barack Obama signed
into office in 2009,

36
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.670
was aimed exactly at addressing

37
00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.280
the problems in
the credit card market,

38
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.350
the credit card accountability,

39
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.885
responsibility, and
Disclosure Act.

40
00:01:41.885 --> 00:01:44.090
The nature of the CARD Act was

41
00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.100
to provide greater
transparency for

42
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.485
consumers on the actual price

43
00:01:48.485 --> 00:01:51.215
of the credit that they
would have to pay.

44
00:01:51.215 --> 00:01:55.490
This eliminated or reduced
the ability of banks to charge

45
00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.530
very high late fees for

46
00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.260
consumers who miss
their credit card payments,

47
00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.300
and also limited the ability of

48
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.895
financial institutions
to increase

49
00:02:04.895 --> 00:02:07.130
interest rates
significantly without

50
00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.565
providing fair warning
to customers.

51
00:02:10.565 --> 00:02:13.910
The idea behind these
interventions was based on

52
00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.850
the simple observation that
Elizabeth Warren made,

53
00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.550
that card contracts
had grown increasingly

54
00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.565
complicated in the decades
leading up to their crisis.

55
00:02:22.565 --> 00:02:26.300
They went from being on
average a page in the 1970s,

56
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.305
to 40 pages by the
time the crisis hit.

57
00:02:29.305 --> 00:02:32.020
This meant that
whatever expectation you had

58
00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.335
for consumers to read
a single page contract,

59
00:02:35.335 --> 00:02:38.560
even the most sophisticated
among us would never read

60
00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.355
a 40 page credit
card contract and

61
00:02:41.355 --> 00:02:43.330
understand and
appreciate the terms

62
00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.280
associated with their borrowing.

63
00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.990
This means that what you actually

64
00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:48.835
pay attention to as consumers,

65
00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:52.960
is the teaser rate that's
offered to you that's listed on

66
00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.670
even the outside of

67
00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.345
the envelope which gives you
a credit card solicitation.

68
00:02:58.345 --> 00:03:00.835
That's what you think
the price of credit is,

69
00:03:00.835 --> 00:03:02.740
without realizing
that that teaser rate

70
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.810
is going to expire very quickly,

71
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.940
without realizing that if you are

72
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.965
delinquent on
your credit card payment,

73
00:03:08.965 --> 00:03:11.675
you're going to bear high fees.

74
00:03:11.675 --> 00:03:13.850
Financial institutions said that

75
00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.510
this regulation that aimed
at protecting consumers

76
00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.330
from having to pay a price for

77
00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:21.800
credit that was significantly

78
00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.705
higher than what
they anticipated,

79
00:03:23.705 --> 00:03:25.580
would actually hurt
precisely that

80
00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.935
consumers that are aimed to help.

81
00:03:27.935 --> 00:03:29.810
Jamie Diamond the CEO of

82
00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.750
JP Morgan Chase said that in
response to the CARD Act,

83
00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.910
his bank would
simply stop offering

84
00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.015
credit cards to 15 percent
of its customers.

85
00:03:38.015 --> 00:03:39.710
Because what the CARD
Act had done is,

86
00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:41.810
it restricted
JP Morgan's ability to

87
00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.375
reprice the cost of
credit to consumers

88
00:03:44.375 --> 00:03:47.510
once aspects of
consumer's risk profile

89
00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.970
became known to
the financial institution.

90
00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.850
A for example, a consumer
who is late in making

91
00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.585
repayments is riskier than
a consumer who pays on time.

92
00:03:56.585 --> 00:03:59.060
In reality, the
empirical evidence on

93
00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.760
the CARD acts suggests
that contrary

94
00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.830
to this expectations set

95
00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:07.675
by JP Morgan and
other financial institutions,

96
00:04:07.675 --> 00:04:09.905
that the CARD Act
would harm consumers.

97
00:04:09.905 --> 00:04:11.660
It actually helped
consumers quite

98
00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.840
significantly decreasing
the total cost of

99
00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:20.665
credit for consumers by
around $13 billion annually.

100
00:04:20.665 --> 00:04:24.070
Empirical evidence
shows no suggestion

101
00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:25.450
that other kinds of

102
00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.700
bank fees increase
in order to cover

103
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.340
the costs of the CARD Act,

104
00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:31.960
or that consumer if

105
00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.870
that credit supply was
decreased significantly for

106
00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.240
consumers expect in
ways that the CARD Act

107
00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.450
anticipated and in fact
desired by for example,

108
00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.055
decreasing the tendency of

109
00:04:42.055 --> 00:04:44.975
credit card companies, and
financial institutions,

110
00:04:44.975 --> 00:04:47.890
to advertise credit cards
to college students,

111
00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:49.360
without ascertaining
that they had

112
00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.865
any ability to repay this credit,

113
00:04:51.865 --> 00:04:55.625
and trapping them in
expensive cycles of debt.

114
00:04:55.625 --> 00:04:59.560
As we've discussed,
interchange fees

115
00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.840
became a significantly large cost

116
00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.850
of operating for merchants.

117
00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:05.380
So in the aftermath of

118
00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.720
the crisis we did
several things to

119
00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.760
help decrease the payment costs
associated for consumers.

120
00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.445
Things like overdraft protection
or the CARD Act.

121
00:05:15.445 --> 00:05:17.530
But what we also did was try and

122
00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.350
restrict these fees that
are born by merchants.

123
00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:23.545
This was also in the guise
of consumer protection.

124
00:05:23.545 --> 00:05:26.335
The idea behind the Durbin
Amendment which was

125
00:05:26.335 --> 00:05:29.559
added to Dodd Frank by
Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois,

126
00:05:29.559 --> 00:05:31.135
was that it would decrease

127
00:05:31.135 --> 00:05:33.475
interchange fees
that merchants bore,

128
00:05:33.475 --> 00:05:36.280
and as a result

129
00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.520
decrease the costs for
consumers of retail goods,

130
00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.730
since consumers are the ones
who inherently bear

131
00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:46.295
higher interchange expense
that merchants have to pay.

132
00:05:46.295 --> 00:05:49.295
Interestingly,
although initial ideas

133
00:05:49.295 --> 00:05:51.770
a brown interchange
regulation focused on

134
00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:54.140
credit interchange
were interchange rates

135
00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:55.565
tend to be higher.

136
00:05:55.565 --> 00:05:57.995
Eventually, the Durbin
Amendment targeted

137
00:05:57.995 --> 00:06:00.380
only debit interchange and left

138
00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.395
credit interchange
fees unregulated.

139
00:06:03.395 --> 00:06:07.940
This is a strange regulatory
intervention given that if

140
00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:10.400
anything we view debit cards

141
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.590
as a safer payment instrument,

142
00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:13.790
and credit cards as

143
00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:15.710
a more dangerous payment
instrument because

144
00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:19.600
they coupled transacting
and consumer borrowing.

145
00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.820
The idea the reason
that Durbin offered for

146
00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.350
this intervention being focused

147
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:25.895
on the debit market was that,

148
00:06:25.895 --> 00:06:27.300
in the aftermath of

149
00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:29.180
the recession there
was a concern that

150
00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:30.980
restrictions in
the credit market or

151
00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:33.500
further restrictions
in the credit market,

152
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.230
would restrict credit supply
at a moment in time

153
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:40.940
when the recovery
was barely underway,

154
00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:42.080
and it was important for

155
00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.270
consumers and businesses
to be able to get

156
00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:48.670
access to these funds
for borrowing.

157
00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:51.650
In reality though,
the decision to focus

158
00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:53.930
on debit rather than
credit interchange,

159
00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:55.040
made the Durbin Amendment a

160
00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.860
rather complicated
regulatory intervention

161
00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:01.900
in an undesirable one from
the perspective of consumers.

162
00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:04.940
What banks did in the aftermath
of Durbin was that,

163
00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:07.910
they decreased
credit debit card rewards

164
00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:09.650
and all but eliminated them,

165
00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:12.845
and significantly increased
credit card rewards

166
00:07:12.845 --> 00:07:14.000
in order to convince

167
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.040
consumers to use
credit cards which were

168
00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:18.875
left unregulated by
this intervention.

169
00:07:18.875 --> 00:07:21.410
Since credit interchange was

170
00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:24.080
still very profitable to
financial institutions,

171
00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.240
they wanted to encourage
all consumers to

172
00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.550
use credit instruments
and discourage

173
00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:30.260
the use of debit
instruments that tend

174
00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.000
to be associated now after

175
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.140
Durbin with lower
interchange revenue for banks.

176
00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:39.185
In theory, financial
institutions get

177
00:07:39.185 --> 00:07:42.050
revenue from checking
accounts in one of two ways.

178
00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:44.030
The first is that they can charge

179
00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:47.270
consumers a monthly maintenance
fee on their account,

180
00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:49.460
for even opening
a checking account

181
00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:51.980
and serving it for that consumer.

182
00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:53.780
The second is they generate

183
00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:55.820
revenue from interchange every

184
00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:57.965
time consumers use
their debit cards

185
00:07:57.965 --> 00:07:59.765
as a means of purchase.

186
00:07:59.765 --> 00:08:01.575
What the Durbin Amendment did is,

187
00:08:01.575 --> 00:08:04.010
it restricted the ability
of banks to generate

188
00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:06.530
profits from debit interchange,

189
00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:08.600
by capping debit interchange fees

190
00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:11.480
at around $0.22 per transaction,

191
00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:15.440
when previously
a $100 debit expense

192
00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:17.180
would generate an
interchange revenue

193
00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:19.555
of around two dollars for a bank.

194
00:08:19.555 --> 00:08:23.570
This decrease in revenue
banks first tried to combat,

195
00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:26.720
by charging exactly those
customers who use to

196
00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:28.250
transact with their debit card

197
00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:30.230
and generate interchange revenue,

198
00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:33.950
a fee for transacting with
their debit card directly.

199
00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:36.170
They proposed
a five dollar fee on

200
00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:38.630
consumers who use
their debit card as

201
00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:40.160
a means of purchase in

202
00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:43.100
any month when they
use their debit card,

203
00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:44.510
this is something
that for example

204
00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:46.540
Bank of America proposed.

205
00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:49.550
In response, large groups
of protesters and

206
00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:52.160
the Occupy Wall Street
Movement burned

207
00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:55.745
Bank of America debit cards
in Times Square,

208
00:08:55.745 --> 00:08:57.740
and Bank of America
quickly walked

209
00:08:57.740 --> 00:08:59.990
back from this proposed fee,

210
00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:02.780
and instead what
large financial institutions

211
00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:03.980
like Bank of America

212
00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:08.030
and Wells Fargo and JP Morgan
did in response to Durbin,

213
00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:11.390
was they increased
the account fees that they

214
00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:15.080
charge consumers to
generate this lost revenue.

215
00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:17.000
So prior to Durbin,

216
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.670
around 80 percent of customers at

217
00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:21.650
large financial institutions had

218
00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:24.005
access to a free
checking account.

219
00:09:24.005 --> 00:09:26.015
This means a checking
account that has

220
00:09:26.015 --> 00:09:27.965
a zero dollar maintenance fee

221
00:09:27.965 --> 00:09:30.500
no matter the size
of the account.

222
00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:32.870
Following the Durbin Amendment,

223
00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:37.100
banks put a extra fee
on consumers for

224
00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:39.320
having an account on
the order of let's say

225
00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.765
five dollars a month
for consumers,

226
00:09:41.765 --> 00:09:43.520
who didn't have a sufficiently

227
00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:45.470
large account balance
or didn't have

228
00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:47.570
direct deposit in
their accounts that

229
00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:50.285
generated revenue
in other sources.

230
00:09:50.285 --> 00:09:53.090
This again is
an unintended consequence

231
00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:55.040
of Durbin and a regressive one,

232
00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:57.260
because the only consumers
who are bearing

233
00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.660
these higher account fees
are those who

234
00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:03.020
don't have sufficiently
large account balances.

235
00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:05.120
All in all, estimates suggests

236
00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:06.830
that consumers as a group lose

237
00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:10.310
around $3.5 billion from
the Durbin Amendment,

238
00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:12.980
and that this particular
regulation ended up

239
00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:15.935
hurting precisely the consumers
at sought to help

240
00:10:15.935 --> 00:10:17.615
since these higher account fees

241
00:10:17.615 --> 00:10:19.370
are born disproportionately

242
00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:20.480
by low income and

243
00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:23.725
less financially
sophisticated consumers.

244
00:10:23.725 --> 00:10:25.955
The Durbin Amendment case study

245
00:10:25.955 --> 00:10:29.060
illustrates the effect of
interchange regulation

246
00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:30.770
that economists who study

247
00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:32.570
this particular two-sided market

248
00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:34.580
long suggested would occur.

249
00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:37.250
In two-sided markets,
the idea doing

250
00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:40.790
cost-based regulation like
the Durbin Amendment,

251
00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:43.460
which required that
the Federal Reserve promulgate

252
00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:46.190
rules that didn't
allow merchants to

253
00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:48.995
be charged a cost that was higher

254
00:10:48.995 --> 00:10:53.285
than the actual cost of
processing the transaction,

255
00:10:53.285 --> 00:10:55.220
are a little bit complicated.

256
00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:56.810
Because remember, that these are

257
00:10:56.810 --> 00:10:59.120
two-sided markets
which means that

258
00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:01.445
the intermediaries
generate profits

259
00:11:01.445 --> 00:11:04.935
both from the merchants
and from the consumers.

260
00:11:04.935 --> 00:11:08.630
So loss leader pricing
where one side

261
00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:12.170
of the market is subsidized
at the expense of the other,

262
00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:14.750
might mean that one side
of the market in

263
00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:16.640
a totally competitive world with

264
00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:19.520
no monopoly market
power concerns,

265
00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:22.610
bears a cost that feels
elevated relative to

266
00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:26.240
the true or actual processing
cost in this space.

267
00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:29.180
This is something that's
been studied extensively by

268
00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:32.910
economists like
Nobel Laureate John troll
