Hi everyone. My name is
Natasha Sarin and I'm

2
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.080
a professor here at
the University of Pennsylvania,

3
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.970
at the law school and at

4
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.580
the Wharton School of Business
in the finance department.

5
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.200
My research is primarily in

6
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.050
financial regulation and so
I'm very excited to have

7
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:17.460
the opportunity to talk to

8
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.130
you both about the payment sector

9
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.630
and about how we
should think about

10
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.330
the regulation of
financial technology broadly.
