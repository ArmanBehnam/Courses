00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.500
In this module, we'll be
talking a lot about how

2
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.635
we pay for and transact for
the goods that we purchase.

3
00:00:07.635 --> 00:00:09.780
So I'm going to start by
telling you a little bit

4
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.865
about the history
of payment methods,

5
00:00:11.865 --> 00:00:13.740
and then talk to you
a little bit about

6
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.390
the inherently two-sided nature

7
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:16.920
of this market and why that

8
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.410
makes it quite unique
relative to normal sort

9
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.425
of goods transaction
purchases that we do.

10
00:00:22.425 --> 00:00:24.540
I'm going to talk a little bit
about the growth of

11
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.520
the credit card industry
in particular,

12
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.220
and problems that have
emerged in this industry,

13
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.930
and the way that regulation

14
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.655
has tried to solve
these problems,

15
00:00:32.655 --> 00:00:34.110
and perhaps the way that

16
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.640
financial technology can solve

17
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.365
these problems in the future.

18
00:00:37.365 --> 00:00:39.110
Just to start in sort of level

19
00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.120
the playing field
for us a little bit,

20
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.400
what is and how historically

21
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.470
have we transacted for goods?

22
00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.030
This is a question
that has been with

23
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.040
us since the beginning of time,

24
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.320
and it takes us back to long,

25
00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.720
long ago when we
used to barter or

26
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.230
exchange actual goods
with one another.

27
00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.250
The issue with this bartering
in this slide I present to

28
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.395
you there are bartering horses
for shells for example,

29
00:01:05.395 --> 00:01:09.520
is that there are no real
common standard of value.

30
00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.230
Your livestock might be
really valuable to you

31
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.430
but less valuable to the person
you're transacting with.

32
00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.930
So whose valuation
should govern in

33
00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.050
that particular exchange
is a difficult question.

34
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.640
It's also quite inefficient

35
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.380
as a means of exchange
every time you

36
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.010
want to exchange your livestock
for some shells,

37
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:29.390
you have to carry these goods

38
00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.555
around with you to transact.

39
00:01:31.555 --> 00:01:33.600
So understanding that this is

40
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.480
quite inefficient means
of transacting,

41
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.190
we kind of innovated,

42
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.190
and the first series
of innovations

43
00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.320
had to do with using
rare metals or

44
00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.320
coins in order to be a store

45
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.025
of value for exchanging
and transacting.

46
00:01:49.025 --> 00:01:52.280
This also pose some issues from

47
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.955
the perspective of those in
engaged in these exchanges.

48
00:01:56.955 --> 00:01:59.360
One issue is that
there's inherently

49
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.080
fluctuation in the value
of the metals like gold,

50
00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.205
the silver that you're using

51
00:02:04.205 --> 00:02:07.325
because it depends on how much

52
00:02:07.325 --> 00:02:09.530
gold and silver you have
and your ability to

53
00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.190
make those resources
into these coins.

54
00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.590
It's also deeply burdensome

55
00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.110
to weigh and carry
around every day,

56
00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.990
imagine that we only
transacted with quarters.

57
00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.450
This would be deeply
inefficient for

58
00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.030
all of us and quite cumbersome,

59
00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.700
and quarters are much lighter
than the metals that we

60
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.555
were using in
these means of exchange.

61
00:02:31.555 --> 00:02:36.575
So we got to using paper money
as a means of exchange.

62
00:02:36.575 --> 00:02:38.450
This comes to us from China where

63
00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.225
merchants invented
the first paper money,

64
00:02:41.225 --> 00:02:43.730
and by the 19th
century paper money

65
00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.590
was very common in Europe.

66
00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.310
This while a significant

67
00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.930
advancement that
got rid of some of

68
00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.520
the inefficiencies of for example

69
00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.590
having to carry around
metals with you,

70
00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:55.850
or being concerned about

71
00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.320
the fact that there
are fluctuations in

72
00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.670
these values depending on

73
00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.815
the resources that
you have available,

74
00:03:00.815 --> 00:03:04.010
is still not a perfect
payment structure

75
00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.290
by any means because there are

76
00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.350
real concerns about theft and

77
00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:10.640
the ease of theft when you're

78
00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.200
transacting with paper currency,

79
00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.220
and also a forgery that
counterfeit notes are going to

80
00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.810
emerge and people are going to

81
00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.105
be able to transact with them.

82
00:03:20.105 --> 00:03:22.270
They kind of more modern

83
00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:25.410
innovation we still
obviously have paper money,

84
00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.230
but in the early 1950s,

85
00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.360
we introduced
the first credit cards

86
00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.400
as a means of transacting.

87
00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.290
This had a lot of advantages from

88
00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.480
the perspective of
the consumer who's

89
00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.115
able to now transact with

90
00:03:37.115 --> 00:03:38.480
a single payment instrument

91
00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.860
that they have in their wallet,

92
00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.695
rather than a host of paper bills

93
00:03:42.695 --> 00:03:46.235
or a lot of coins that they're
carrying around with them.

94
00:03:46.235 --> 00:03:49.310
So there's certainly
efficiency gains for consumers.

95
00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.440
There are problems as well for

96
00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.125
the perspective of
both consumers and merchants.

97
00:03:54.125 --> 00:03:56.960
From the consumer perspective
you worry about things like

98
00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.130
credit card fraud which has
emerged as a leading concern.

99
00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:02.840
From the merchant perspective,

100
00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.850
the nature of these markets
which we're going to spend

101
00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:07.535
some time talking
about in this lecture,

102
00:04:07.535 --> 00:04:10.730
resulted in a few
large card networks

103
00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.470
having considerable control
over this market,

104
00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.590
and that creates some problems

105
00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.035
that regulation is
trying to address.

106
00:04:18.035 --> 00:04:19.430
From the merchant perspective,

107
00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.290
the main problem is
that the fees for

108
00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.620
processing these transactions
tend to be very large.

109
00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.130
This is a concern both for
antitrust regulation but

110
00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:32.340
also a concern for financial
innovation going forward.
