1
00:00:01.393 --> 00:00:05.755
Two sided markets are quite distinct
from traditional markets because

2
00:00:05.755 --> 00:00:10.053
they involve the choice of not only
a price but also a price structure.

3
00:00:10.053 --> 00:00:14.390
In a traditional one sided market,
like let's say the market for widgets,

4
00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:17.527
the producer of the widget
says a price for the widget.

5
00:00:17.527 --> 00:00:22.400
And all consumers who value that widget
at that price, and are willing to pay it,

6
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.419
are going to purchase that widget.

7
00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:28.975
In a two-sided market,
like a card network system,

8
00:00:28.975 --> 00:00:33.939
the card network is essentially
the intermediary between

9
00:00:33.939 --> 00:00:38.411
two different, distinct,
traditional markets.

10
00:00:38.411 --> 00:00:40.236
The intermediary with
respect to consumers, and

11
00:00:40.236 --> 00:00:42.761
the intermediary with respect to
merchants who accept these cards.

12
00:00:42.761 --> 00:00:46.800
And so they have to choose not just
prices on both sides of the market but

13
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.242
also a price structure.

14
00:00:48.242 --> 00:00:53.732
How much to levy the cost of processing
these particular transactions,

15
00:00:53.732 --> 00:00:56.797
on consumers relative to on merchants.

16
00:00:56.797 --> 00:01:00.184
Card networks are far from
the only two sided network and

17
00:01:00.184 --> 00:01:05.174
this is a canonical set of issues that
are discussed in the economics literature.

18
00:01:05.174 --> 00:01:09.488
The nature of how costs are distributed
between two different sides of this

19
00:01:09.488 --> 00:01:13.336
market vary depending on the kind
of market we're talking about.

20
00:01:13.336 --> 00:01:15.849
So for example, for newspapers,

21
00:01:15.849 --> 00:01:21.404
we tend to not really charge consumers
significantly for reading the news.

22
00:01:21.404 --> 00:01:25.303
But we charge advertisers
quite significantly for

23
00:01:25.303 --> 00:01:27.937
advertising on those platforms.

24
00:01:27.937 --> 00:01:33.292
With respect to card networks,
cardholders tend to actually be charged,

25
00:01:33.292 --> 00:01:38.732
in essence, a negative transaction fee,
because they receive rewards for

26
00:01:38.732 --> 00:01:44.090
transacting with payment instruments
like debit cards and credit cards.

27
00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.896
And the costs of transaction
are primarily borne by merchants who

28
00:01:48.896 --> 00:01:53.538
pay high processing fees for
processing these transactions.

29
00:01:53.538 --> 00:01:58.025
Note that one issue with traditional
two sided-market relative to

30
00:01:58.025 --> 00:02:02.667
a one-sided market, is just having
a cost that's elevated relative

31
00:02:02.667 --> 00:02:06.521
to what you think the true cost
is on one side of the market,

32
00:02:06.521 --> 00:02:10.007
isn't necessarily indicative
of market failure.

33
00:02:10.007 --> 00:02:15.192
So one side of the market, you often
treat as a loss leader in the perspective

34
00:02:15.192 --> 00:02:19.323
of card networks,
that's the consumer side of the market,

35
00:02:19.323 --> 00:02:23.469
where consumers actually have
a negative cost on that side.

36
00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:28.551
The negative cost that consumers have
means a higher cost than you would set in

37
00:02:28.551 --> 00:02:33.965
a traditional one sided market, is going
to be born by merchants in this setting.

38
00:02:33.965 --> 00:02:39.040
From an antitrust perspective,
this post is some complexity for antitrust

39
00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.356
authorities because simply seeing an
elevated cause relative to what you would

40
00:02:44.356 --> 00:02:49.773
expect on one side of the market isn't by
itself indicative of a market failure.

41
00:02:49.773 --> 00:02:52.975
Setting up a two sided
market is quite complicated,

42
00:02:52.975 --> 00:02:57.564
because the platform is essentially
valueless until you have substantial

43
00:02:57.564 --> 00:03:00.274
participation on both sides of the market.

44
00:03:00.274 --> 00:03:04.143
So even if you set really
attractive credit card terms and

45
00:03:04.143 --> 00:03:08.979
give consumers a ton of rewards,
your platform is valueless unless you

46
00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:12.459
can also convince merchants
to accept your cards.

47
00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.134
Similarly, if you're Uber, you don't
want to charge consumers too much or

48
00:03:17.134 --> 00:03:21.807
no one will ride with you, but you also
don't want to pay drivers too little or

49
00:03:21.807 --> 00:03:23.432
no one will drive for you.

50
00:03:23.432 --> 00:03:28.244
A canonical example that's use to
explain two-sided markets is actually

51
00:03:28.244 --> 00:03:30.162
interestingly night clubs.

52
00:03:30.162 --> 00:03:34.356
And I apologize for the heteronormative
nature of the example I'm about to use but

53
00:03:34.356 --> 00:03:36.687
I think it illustrates
the point quite well.

54
00:03:36.687 --> 00:03:39.363
A night club which only has male patrons,

55
00:03:39.363 --> 00:03:44.410
doesn't have much value to the men who
are patronizing the institution unless

56
00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:49.092
they are able to convince women to also
join and attend at the night club.

57
00:03:49.092 --> 00:03:54.134
Similarly a night club with no men but
only women doesn't have much

58
00:03:54.134 --> 00:03:59.459
value to the women unless they are able
to convince men to also attend.

59
00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.766
Depending on how desirable the extra
woman at the nightclub is men, or

60
00:04:03.766 --> 00:04:07.124
the extra man at the nightclub
is to be existing women,

61
00:04:07.124 --> 00:04:11.504
the nature of the payment structure or
the nature of the price structure

62
00:04:11.504 --> 00:04:15.309
in this market might be different
than what you would expect.

63
00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:19.593
For example, this explains why
ladies drink free at certain

64
00:04:19.593 --> 00:04:24.381
nightclubs on certain evenings
because it's very attractive to be

65
00:04:24.381 --> 00:04:29.352
able to recruit more female patrons for
the existing male customers.

66
00:04:29.352 --> 00:04:34.220
Current networks have value and
cost to both sides of the market.

67
00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.949
Both in the merchant
acceptance relationship, and

68
00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:40.840
in the card holder usage relationship.

69
00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.551
On the merchant side, cards are immensely
valuable because customers that

70
00:04:45.551 --> 00:04:49.091
don't carry cash are able to
buy products and services.

71
00:04:49.091 --> 00:04:53.060
And in this day and age customers tend
to expect that they're going to be

72
00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.028
able to pay for goods with their debit and
credit cards, and you may lose

73
00:04:57.028 --> 00:05:01.095
customers if you're not willing to
accept these transaction methods.

74
00:05:01.095 --> 00:05:06.588
Additionally the sort of cash based theft
concerns or the counterfeiting concerns

75
00:05:06.588 --> 00:05:11.858
are significantly reduced by the existence
of card networks in these markets.

76
00:05:11.858 --> 00:05:17.521
The costs though, are quite significant
depending on the payment instrument and

77
00:05:17.521 --> 00:05:21.378
depending on whether it's a debit card or
credit card or

78
00:05:21.378 --> 00:05:26.959
what particular card network you operate
with, merchants can pay between 1 and

79
00:05:26.959 --> 00:05:31.004
3% of transaction value in
the form of processing fees.

80
00:05:31.004 --> 00:05:36.130
That's quite a significant sum, and
as card usage has really exploded

81
00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:41.685
in the last 30 years, these interchange
costs, as they're referred to,

82
00:05:41.685 --> 00:05:47.084
are often the second highest cost of
operation for merchants after labor.

83
00:05:47.084 --> 00:05:50.168
On the card holder side
of this relationship,

84
00:05:50.168 --> 00:05:55.307
in terms of card holder usage, credit
cards are attractive because they tend

85
00:05:55.307 --> 00:06:00.309
to come with attractive rewards,
things like cashback or airline miles.

86
00:06:00.309 --> 00:06:03.488
There is also the ease of
transacting with credit and

87
00:06:03.488 --> 00:06:07.751
debit cards that simply involve a swipe
of your card rather than having

88
00:06:07.751 --> 00:06:11.597
to deal with the cash that you may or
may not have in your wallet.

89
00:06:11.597 --> 00:06:16.109
But again there are real risks of
transacting with these payment

90
00:06:16.109 --> 00:06:17.202
instruments.

91
00:06:17.202 --> 00:06:21.828
One concern from the consumer perspective
is the possibility of credit or

92
00:06:21.828 --> 00:06:26.751
debit card fraud on their account, which
can depending on your card number and

93
00:06:26.751 --> 00:06:31.390
depending on the payment instrument,
be quite challenging to resolve.

94
00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:37.160
Another concern that's quite distinct to
credit cards is that as we've discussed,

95
00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:41.568
credit cards tend to couple
financial transactions dealing with

96
00:06:41.568 --> 00:06:43.184
financial borrowing.

97
00:06:43.184 --> 00:06:47.573
So you may tend to really use your credit
card quite significantly because you're

98
00:06:47.573 --> 00:06:51.528
really attracted to the ability to
generate a ton of credit card rewards.

99
00:06:51.528 --> 00:06:56.957
But if you don't keep track of your credit
card payments, then you're tending to

100
00:06:56.957 --> 00:07:02.399
bear high delinquency fees and get trapped
in expensive cycles of consumer debt.

101
00:07:02.399 --> 00:07:05.408
Another real attraction of credit and

102
00:07:05.408 --> 00:07:10.580
debit card usage from the perspective
of consumers is this allows

103
00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:15.954
them to transact it online in ways
that cash simply wouldn't do so.

104
00:07:15.954 --> 00:07:21.301
As e-commerce has grown quite
significantly in the early 2000s

105
00:07:21.301 --> 00:07:26.844
transacting online for goods was
less than 1% of total retail sales.

106
00:07:26.844 --> 00:07:31.442
In 2018 it was almost 10%,
so as it's become common for

107
00:07:31.442 --> 00:07:34.478
us to purchase goods from eBay or Amazon,

108
00:07:34.478 --> 00:07:38.669
the value of credit and
debit payments has skyrocketed.

109
00:07:38.669 --> 00:07:43.525
And also again from a distributional
perspective, those consumers who don't

110
00:07:43.525 --> 00:07:47.873
have access to a debit card,
let's say because they're unbanked, or

111
00:07:47.873 --> 00:07:52.511
those consumers who don't have access
to a credit card, let's say because

112
00:07:52.511 --> 00:07:57.295
they're subprime consumers who are risky
borrowers that banks don't want to

113
00:07:57.295 --> 00:08:02.006
lend to in this manner, are actually shut
out from an important means of being

114
00:08:02.006 --> 00:08:05.540
able to transact for
goods online through e-commerce.

115
00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:09.260
A long with e-commerce another
significant driver of growth

116
00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:13.250
of card usage has been the expansion
of credit card rewards programs.

117
00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:17.753
Following the financial
crises as regulation that

118
00:08:17.753 --> 00:08:20.705
we will discuss in
a later module restricted

119
00:08:20.705 --> 00:08:25.519
the ability of banks to generate
revenues from debit processing fees.

120
00:08:25.519 --> 00:08:30.859
This regulation left untouched credit
processing fees, and so banks and

121
00:08:30.859 --> 00:08:36.212
card networks had every to try and
encourage greater use of credit cards.

122
00:08:36.212 --> 00:08:40.334
Credit cards also tend to have higher
processing fees generally making,

123
00:08:40.334 --> 00:08:44.653
from the bank's perspective, it really
attractive for consumers to try and

124
00:08:44.653 --> 00:08:47.387
tack primarily with these
credit instruments.

125
00:08:47.387 --> 00:08:51.867
In order to get consumers to use
credit cards more frequently,

126
00:08:51.867 --> 00:08:56.856
card networks and financial institutions
realized that they could do

127
00:08:56.856 --> 00:09:00.238
well by offering really
attractive rewards and

128
00:09:00.238 --> 00:09:05.164
cash-back loyalty programs to
consumers for their transactions.

129
00:09:05.164 --> 00:09:10.359
Additionally, as credit cards have become
an incredibly competitive industry,

130
00:09:10.359 --> 00:09:15.032
and one in which consumers really do
display a willingness to switch credit

131
00:09:15.032 --> 00:09:20.004
cards depending on the rewards that
they're being offered, card networks and

132
00:09:20.004 --> 00:09:25.125
financial institutions really have to best
each other with respect to the rewards

133
00:09:25.125 --> 00:09:29.537
they offer consumers in order to
maintain substantial market share.

134
00:09:29.537 --> 00:09:34.673
Consumers tend to be highly responsive
to the offerings of rewards and

135
00:09:34.673 --> 00:09:38.850
to the transact much more with
cards when it is attractive

136
00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:41.559
to them from a rewards perspective.

137
00:09:41.559 --> 00:09:46.554
Recent work by the Federal Reserve Bank
in Boston finds that consumers generally

138
00:09:46.554 --> 00:09:51.043
spend more and increase their debt
when offered 1% cash back rewards.

139
00:09:51.043 --> 00:09:55.636
And evidence from Credit Bureau data
confirms that consumers substitute their

140
00:09:55.636 --> 00:10:00.572
spending from other cards to the card with
cashback, and decrease debt on their other

141
00:10:00.572 --> 00:10:04.428
cards in order to take advantage
of attractive rewards programs.

142
00:10:04.428 --> 00:10:09.528
This is quite important, because it
suggests that consumers are increasing

143
00:10:09.528 --> 00:10:14.235
their indebtedness past the level
which perhaps is socially optimal,

144
00:10:14.235 --> 00:10:19.343
in order to take advantage of the
existence of attractive rewards programs.
