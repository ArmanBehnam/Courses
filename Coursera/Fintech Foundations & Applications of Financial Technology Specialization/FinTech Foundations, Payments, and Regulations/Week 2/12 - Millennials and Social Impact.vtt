1
00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:07.815
So millennials are
optimistic, they're hopeful.

2
00:00:07.815 --> 00:00:09.630
They're hopeful about
their financial future.

3
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.730
They may be currently less
trusting one another and

4
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.385
certainly of
financial services firm

5
00:00:14.385 --> 00:00:16.875
more than a footnote
of importance to

6
00:00:16.875 --> 00:00:21.480
FinTech entrepreneurs
and clients.

7
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.365
They also experienced the GFC

8
00:00:25.365 --> 00:00:30.855
very vibrantly in
tech full Technicolor.

9
00:00:30.855 --> 00:00:32.480
To say it another way, as you

10
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.280
saw in the data a second ago,

11
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.840
the risk aversion clearly

12
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.360
shifted as the empirical evidence

13
00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.860
preceding it suggested they

14
00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.855
would be coming less
tolerant of risk,

15
00:00:43.855 --> 00:00:47.570
more averse to taking chances
in the financial markets.

16
00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.545
Although there's not a bevy
of research specifically

17
00:00:51.545 --> 00:00:53.120
identifying the GFC in

18
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.045
the market volatility as
a point of discontinuity,

19
00:00:56.045 --> 00:00:58.610
the anecdotal evidence suggests

20
00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.670
that we see a generational shift
and social attitudes,

21
00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.670
that have motivated
millennials to have

22
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.760
a greater desire to
matter in the world.

23
00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.665
To say it another way,

24
00:01:09.665 --> 00:01:12.680
impact investment
strategies have risen

25
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.370
to high level of importance
for millennial asset owners,

26
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.260
not just today, but in the way

27
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.330
they answer questions
about the future.

28
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.300
For example, a recent
US Trust survey found

29
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.000
that almost 90 percent of
millennial respondents are

30
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.850
either currently owned or
are interested in owning in

31
00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.490
the future investments
that allow them

32
00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.234
to express their values,

33
00:01:34.234 --> 00:01:37.455
their missions, and
social impact concerns,

34
00:01:37.455 --> 00:01:41.165
that focuses on
environmental sustainability,

35
00:01:41.165 --> 00:01:46.730
it focuses on social responsibility,
issues of ethnicity,

36
00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.400
race, gender in investments,

37
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.910
and a whole bevy of
non-financial concerns.

38
00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.480
A recent World Economic
Forum survey of

39
00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.590
about 5,000 investors
across almost 20 countries,

40
00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.790
showed results suggesting
that over a third of

41
00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.550
millennial respondents felt that

42
00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.630
improved society should be
the top priority of business.

43
00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.760
That contrasts with
what Milton Friedman

44
00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.385
is often described as

45
00:02:16.385 --> 00:02:17.690
suggesting which is that

46
00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.640
the only social
responsible activity

47
00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.560
of business should be
producing profits.

48
00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.300
If you look at the data, purpose

49
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.860
and profit were the top two

50
00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.180
scored primary purposes of

51
00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.745
businesses for that
millennial demographic.

52
00:02:31.745 --> 00:02:33.530
If you look at
the lowest quarter spots,

53
00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:34.930
it was creating wealth.

54
00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.840
So millennials want to matter,

55
00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.120
and they want to matter through

56
00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.745
their investments as well as
through other activities.

57
00:02:40.745 --> 00:02:43.430
We can see, as you can
see on the graph in

58
00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.945
front of you, how
environmental, social,

59
00:02:45.945 --> 00:02:48.410
and governance
activities and purposes,

60
00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.100
and pursuits have increased

61
00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.110
at essentially the
same time we've seen

62
00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.170
an increase in
interests in FinTech.

63
00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.000
The growth of ESG in

64
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.844
corporation reported by
investors of all varieties

65
00:03:00.844 --> 00:03:03.350
including mutual funds and

66
00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.395
institutions and so
on has been dramatic.

67
00:03:06.395 --> 00:03:09.860
Almost $12 trillion in the US was

68
00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.370
reported at the end of
2018 being allocated in

69
00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.730
some non-financial
capacity or with

70
00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.090
a non-financial purpose
again across environmental,

71
00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.760
social, or governance criteria,

72
00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.750
again with millennial motivations
by some measure of it.
