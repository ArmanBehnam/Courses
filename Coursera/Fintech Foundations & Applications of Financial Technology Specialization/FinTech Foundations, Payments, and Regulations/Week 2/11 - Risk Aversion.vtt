1
00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:08.358
One doesn't have to look very far back
in history to know that we've come

2
00:00:08.358 --> 00:00:10.811
through substantial market volatility.

3
00:00:10.811 --> 00:00:15.174
Although we've had an enjoyed one
of the longest runs of equity

4
00:00:15.174 --> 00:00:17.726
bull market experience in history,

5
00:00:17.726 --> 00:00:22.353
we still have had equity market
volatility over recent horizons.

6
00:00:22.353 --> 00:00:25.674
And over and
across the great financial crisis,

7
00:00:25.674 --> 00:00:30.049
and the market volatility associated
with it during and after.

8
00:00:30.049 --> 00:00:33.150
It turns out that this affects investors,
and

9
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.763
is a critical piece of what we might
think about in the fintech space,

10
00:00:37.763 --> 00:00:42.231
both are with respect to clients
like the millennial generation.

11
00:00:42.231 --> 00:00:46.672
But also across the entire
range of demographics.

12
00:00:46.672 --> 00:00:52.705
Part of what we know has been informed by
the concept of the Depression Baby Affect.

13
00:00:52.705 --> 00:00:58.100
Sociologists know this effect as being
the behavioral characteristics and

14
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.323
actions taken or not taken by those
who lived through The Great Depression

15
00:01:03.323 --> 00:01:07.472
in the United States in the first
part of the last century.

16
00:01:07.472 --> 00:01:12.166
Or, in fact, as it turns out,
the behaviors of their progeny.

17
00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:17.113
They're often reported as
being less tolerant of risk,

18
00:01:17.113 --> 00:01:19.902
and being people who save more.

19
00:01:19.902 --> 00:01:23.744
Some sociologists tell us that
they're actually less garrulous, and

20
00:01:23.744 --> 00:01:27.916
perhaps at the margin might be more
introverted than previous generations.

21
00:01:27.916 --> 00:01:32.147
Researchers have found that this
characteristic is not one only of

22
00:01:32.147 --> 00:01:36.693
deep market volatility or
market crashes, or economic depressions.

23
00:01:36.693 --> 00:01:41.231
But may in fact, be a characteristic
simply of traditional levels of

24
00:01:41.231 --> 00:01:43.666
volatility as well as the extremes.

25
00:01:43.666 --> 00:01:47.222
A couple years ago, Malmendier and
Nagel published an article called

26
00:01:47.222 --> 00:01:50.968
Depression Babies, Do Macroeconomic
Experiences Affect Risk Taking?

27
00:01:50.968 --> 00:01:57.968
In which they examined the experiences of
investors across large periods of time,

28
00:01:57.968 --> 00:02:03.068
studying the market experiences,
volatility of markets,

29
00:02:03.068 --> 00:02:07.670
and then their subsequent
willingness to take risks.

30
00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:13.200
What they found was that investor market
experience clearly impacts risk aversion,

31
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.434
risk capacity, and the actual subsequent
taking of risk in financial markets.

32
00:02:18.434 --> 00:02:22.950
They found that investors who have earned
low stock market returns in the past

33
00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.324
are less likely to take financial risk.

34
00:02:25.324 --> 00:02:31.139
Are less likely to participate in the
stock market when they are taking risks,

35
00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:33.869
and investing less more generally,

36
00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:38.202
given that they have had recent
low stock market returns.

37
00:02:38.202 --> 00:02:42.974
It turns out that more recent experiences
have stronger effects on investors' risk

38
00:02:42.974 --> 00:02:43.720
appetites.

39
00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:49.783
And that especially when these risk
experiences happen earlier in life,

40
00:02:49.783 --> 00:02:53.021
they can have longer lasting effects.

41
00:02:53.021 --> 00:02:57.936
What they found was that when
they compared differences,

42
00:02:57.936 --> 00:03:02.851
in previous stock market returns,
to future stock market

43
00:03:02.851 --> 00:03:07.481
participation, a positive
relationship resulted.

44
00:03:07.481 --> 00:03:11.565
Of course life time effects or
life cycle effects have to be handled.

45
00:03:11.565 --> 00:03:16.786
In other words, traditional financial
planning thinking suggests that

46
00:03:16.786 --> 00:03:22.351
when investors are older, they can,
should and do take lower levels of risk.

47
00:03:22.351 --> 00:03:26.330
In part, because they have a shorter
horizon in which to make up any

48
00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.966
shortfalls or losses,
compared to when they're younger.

49
00:03:29.966 --> 00:03:34.838
When they have a longer horizon,
they're more apt or able to bear risk.

50
00:03:34.838 --> 00:03:36.421
So what Malmendier and

51
00:03:36.421 --> 00:03:41.265
Nagel cleverly did was to integrate
out the old versus young effect.

52
00:03:41.265 --> 00:03:46.441
What we find when we look at their
results in the graph in front of you,

53
00:03:46.441 --> 00:03:52.428
is a positive and strongly statistically
significant relationship comparing

54
00:03:52.428 --> 00:03:58.971
previous market experience, market results
to future stock market participation.

55
00:03:58.971 --> 00:04:02.659
In other words, when stock market
returns were low in the past,

56
00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:05.271
future stock market participation was low.

57
00:04:05.271 --> 00:04:10.854
When market returns were high in the past,
future market participation was high.

58
00:04:10.854 --> 00:04:12.136
In other words,

59
00:04:12.136 --> 00:04:17.729
people's ability to take risk was
not just about the Great Depression.

60
00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:22.440
It was about market experiences and
the continuum of market experiences.

61
00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:29.475
Well, we find that that's also
true construed across cohorts.

62
00:04:29.475 --> 00:04:33.759
We find that this sensitivity
to risk aversion and

63
00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:39.777
how it affects millennials more
strongly is born out by current data,

64
00:04:39.777 --> 00:04:46.422
and data in particular, following
behavior through the financial crisis.

65
00:04:46.422 --> 00:04:52.158
In the graph in front of you provided
by the Investment Company Institute's

66
00:04:52.158 --> 00:04:57.355
annual profile of mutual fund
shareholders, coupled together by us

67
00:04:57.355 --> 00:05:02.372
going back to 1998,
through the periods ending in 2018,

68
00:05:02.372 --> 00:05:07.030
we see that well as financial
planning tenants would tell us,

69
00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.733
those who are older are less
likely to take risk.

70
00:05:10.733 --> 00:05:15.844
The question specifically asked whether
you are willing to take above average or

71
00:05:15.844 --> 00:05:19.014
substantial risk in your
investment portfolio?

72
00:05:19.014 --> 00:05:24.354
So the data from 1998, say that 16% of
those who are 65 or older would be willing

73
00:05:24.354 --> 00:05:29.644
to take above average or substantial risk,
corresponding to the traditional logic.

74
00:05:29.644 --> 00:05:34.415
When you're older, you're less likely and
you're less able to handle risk,

75
00:05:34.415 --> 00:05:36.345
given your life expectancies.

76
00:05:36.345 --> 00:05:40.911
If you go the the 50 to 64 crowd,
well, 35% were interested or

77
00:05:40.911 --> 00:05:44.397
willing to take above average or
substantial risk.

78
00:05:44.397 --> 00:05:48.692
If you go to the 35 to 49 crowd,
it goes up to 39%.

79
00:05:48.692 --> 00:05:51.746
If you go down to the younger than 35,

80
00:05:51.746 --> 00:05:56.571
you're all the way up to 50%,
more than 50%, 52%.

81
00:05:56.571 --> 00:06:00.002
Those younger than 35 are willing
to take above average or

82
00:06:00.002 --> 00:06:02.620
substantial risk in your portfolio, fine.

83
00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:10.028
However, what you see, when you look at
volatility across the financial crisis.

84
00:06:10.028 --> 00:06:16.428
So for example, if you could look at 2004,
but then especially in 2009,

85
00:06:16.428 --> 00:06:22.366
11, 15 and 17, the younger generations,
the millennial segment,

86
00:06:22.366 --> 00:06:27.774
rapidly fell in their willingness
to take risk in their portfolios.

87
00:06:27.774 --> 00:06:33.479
Between 98 in 2011,
the number went from 52% to 31%.

88
00:06:33.479 --> 00:06:37.571
Compare that to the 65 or
older cog, for example,

89
00:06:37.571 --> 00:06:42.035
that went from 16%,
in fact, in 2011 to 18%,

90
00:06:42.035 --> 00:06:46.221
their interest and
willingness to take risk went up.

91
00:06:46.221 --> 00:06:50.861
For the 50 to 64, 98 to 2011,
it went from 35 to 26.

92
00:06:50.861 --> 00:06:54.271
For the 35 to 49,

93
00:06:54.271 --> 00:06:59.198
it went from 39 in 2018,

94
00:06:59.198 --> 00:07:02.614
to 38 in 2011.

95
00:07:02.614 --> 00:07:06.166
The Malmendier and
Nagel results were born out.

96
00:07:06.166 --> 00:07:10.687
The younger cohorts had
a greater affect in their

97
00:07:10.687 --> 00:07:16.321
experiences facing market
volatility than older cohorts.

98
00:07:16.321 --> 00:07:22.143
And in fact, they have still not
recovered back to the 1998 levels.

99
00:07:22.143 --> 00:07:26.747
It turns out, one of the most
important target markets of FinTech

100
00:07:26.747 --> 00:07:29.762
activities is not only risk averse today,

101
00:07:29.762 --> 00:07:34.721
compared to historical levels,
they're most sensitive to risk,.

102
00:07:34.721 --> 00:07:36.584
And as Malmendier and Nagel remind us,

103
00:07:36.584 --> 00:07:39.132
it could take decades for
them to move back into risk.

104
00:07:39.132 --> 00:07:42.237
That holds open the promise for
robo advisory.

105
00:07:42.237 --> 00:07:46.928
Representing both a tailwind, but
also a potential headwind to the actual

106
00:07:46.928 --> 00:07:50.062
activity of risk taking and
financial advising.
