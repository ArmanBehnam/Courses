1
00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:10.140
If customers of FinTech companies
are expected to rely at

2
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.020
least in part if
not in the whole on

3
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.140
the algorithms of
the technology of themselves,

4
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.750
what do we know about
how important trust is?

5
00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.570
There's a substantial
amount of work

6
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.280
on trust in financial
markets and in

7
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.185
the financial advisory space

8
00:00:25.185 --> 00:00:27.600
and that would include
in the insurance space,

9
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.919
in the real estate space,

10
00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:30.510
and some of the related
spaces we talked

11
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.600
about as part of
these lectures that are

12
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.030
informative about
what we might be able

13
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.045
to conclude in
the case of FinTech.

14
00:00:39.045 --> 00:00:40.695
Of course in FinTech,

15
00:00:40.695 --> 00:00:42.920
we have a number of
other considerations

16
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.095
including the quality
of algorithms

17
00:00:45.095 --> 00:00:50.030
and what the human machine
interface might look like.

18
00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.240
Let us look next at some
of the evidence that has

19
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.380
accumulated by way of
research and anecdote.

20
00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.700
Behavioralist and
psychologists tell us

21
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.190
that when human
see each other for

22
00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.890
the first time or perhaps
see each other after

23
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.315
not having seen one another
for a period of time,

24
00:01:07.315 --> 00:01:11.210
we quickly assess
attributes of safety

25
00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.040
and competence very
rapidly and powerfully.

26
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.060
The first two principal
components if you

27
00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.930
will of human interaction.

28
00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.170
We can often think of levels of

29
00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.365
trust construed along
these dimensions.

30
00:01:25.365 --> 00:01:28.380
For example, trust in
technical competence.

31
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.395
So now, how do I trust that
you know what you're doing?

32
00:01:32.395 --> 00:01:35.525
Second, especially important in

33
00:01:35.525 --> 00:01:37.040
financial transactions and

34
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.020
financial service
and relationships,

35
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.465
trust and ethical conduct
and character.

36
00:01:41.465 --> 00:01:45.160
Do I trust you not to
steal money from me?

37
00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.005
Important of course
in an obvious way.

38
00:01:49.005 --> 00:01:52.275
Third, trust in
the ability to be human,

39
00:01:52.275 --> 00:01:54.195
trust and empathetic skills,

40
00:01:54.195 --> 00:01:56.360
maturity, emotional intelligence.

41
00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.435
If I tell you personal things
about myself or my family,

42
00:01:59.435 --> 00:02:01.880
can I trust that you, an advisor,

43
00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.830
will handle that well
and can provide counsel?

44
00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.600
Many who are concerned
about FinTech crowding out

45
00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.730
the traditional methodologies and

46
00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.160
traditional relationships

47
00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.070
in the advisory space
and elsewhere,

48
00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.210
often highlight the last
component under the idea that

49
00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.415
three million years of
human progress may not be

50
00:02:24.415 --> 00:02:27.115
ultimately resulting
in an app by itself.

51
00:02:27.115 --> 00:02:30.455
However, the open
question remains of,

52
00:02:30.455 --> 00:02:33.460
what are the trade-offs
between or the interactions

53
00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.820
between trust in
advisory services,

54
00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.770
the kind of services
that FinTech providers

55
00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.440
are actually
potentially providing,

56
00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.525
and the clients need
to feel safety.

57
00:02:46.525 --> 00:02:48.345
What builds trust?

58
00:02:48.345 --> 00:02:50.480
Well traditionally,

59
00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.805
we hear taking time
to explain products

60
00:02:52.805 --> 00:02:57.815
and offerings and
recommendations; explaining fees,

61
00:02:57.815 --> 00:03:00.845
staying up to date with
current products and trends,

62
00:03:00.845 --> 00:03:03.665
responding quickly
to client needs.

63
00:03:03.665 --> 00:03:05.915
Although, our research suggests

64
00:03:05.915 --> 00:03:08.480
the financial services
industry over

65
00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.995
emphasizes required frequency
of communication.

66
00:03:11.995 --> 00:03:14.450
We studied this at
Wharton partnership with

67
00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.120
State Street Global Advisors
a couple years ago.

68
00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.605
We did a survey of thousands

69
00:03:18.605 --> 00:03:21.530
of financial advisors
and their clients.

70
00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.450
The kind of clients who might be

71
00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.250
purchasers of FinTech
Services at some level,

72
00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.285
at least from
a consumer perspective.

73
00:03:29.285 --> 00:03:31.669
We asked what the most
important characteristic

74
00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:33.215
of a financial advisor is.

75
00:03:33.215 --> 00:03:35.270
Far and away, both advisors

76
00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:38.050
and their clients which
who were matched,

77
00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.000
indicated that trustworthiness of

78
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.865
the advisor was
the most important element.

79
00:03:43.865 --> 00:03:48.050
Trustworthiness was at the
margin seen as more important

80
00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:49.790
by advisors then clients but over

81
00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.160
all the possibilities
for both of them,

82
00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.520
trustworthiness was at the top.

83
00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:59.075
Second understanding
the family's needs and goals.

84
00:03:59.075 --> 00:04:01.730
Again, viewed slightly more

85
00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.030
important by advisors
than by clients.

86
00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:10.190
Quick efficient Folsom
communication seem more

87
00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:11.670
important at the margin
by clients and

88
00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.870
advisors and then performance.

89
00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.020
Interestingly enough,
financial advisors viewed

90
00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:21.955
performance as less
important than clients.

91
00:04:21.955 --> 00:04:24.050
Finally, cost fees.

92
00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.140
Advisors felt that fees
were not as important as

93
00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:29.675
trustworthiness
which was inherent

94
00:04:29.675 --> 00:04:31.885
in the client data as well,

95
00:04:31.885 --> 00:04:34.550
but they thought it was
less important than clients

96
00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.235
saw among other possible
answers as well.

97
00:04:38.235 --> 00:04:40.550
So far and away,
the trustworthiness

98
00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.490
of an advisor appears to

99
00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.130
matter at the margin more
for advisors than clients

100
00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:49.540
but for both
incredibly important.

101
00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.760
An additional part of
the analysis looked at

102
00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.340
the most important attributes of

103
00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:56.750
the value proposition of

104
00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:01.195
financial advisors
ranging from knowledge,

105
00:05:01.195 --> 00:05:04.655
personal factors including
relationship factors,

106
00:05:04.655 --> 00:05:08.630
communication styles
including proactiveness,

107
00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.895
stability of the relationship,

108
00:05:10.895 --> 00:05:14.240
transparency and
responsiveness for

109
00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.240
clients being knowledgeable
was seen as most important.

110
00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:25.115
Clearly important for
the FinTech industry is

111
00:05:25.115 --> 00:05:28.520
the ability to
reflect and to carry

112
00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:32.000
through knowledgeable
applications of

113
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.580
their art in their craft.

114
00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.810
Responsiveness was seen as

115
00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:37.580
the third most
important thing for

116
00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:41.960
advisors followed by personal
factors including pedigree,

117
00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.710
and history and tenure in

118
00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:50.410
the profession not seen as
very important by clients.

119
00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:51.840
Top for clients was knowledge,

120
00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.110
second was responsiveness,
third was transparency.

121
00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.590
Knowledge responsiveness
and transparency are

122
00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:00.745
things that the FinTech
industry can lead with.

123
00:06:00.745 --> 00:06:03.740
On the other hand,
financial advisors

124
00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.300
thought that personal factors,

125
00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.435
knowledge and responsiveness
were most important.

126
00:06:08.435 --> 00:06:12.145
Once again areas in which
FinTech may have an advantage.

127
00:06:12.145 --> 00:06:14.280
What do millennials think of it?

128
00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.330
Well, in research specifically

129
00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.145
focusing on the millennials,

130
00:06:19.145 --> 00:06:20.510
when they were asked what

131
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:26.475
the most important
characteristics of advisors were.

132
00:06:26.475 --> 00:06:29.270
Well, first the dependent
upon complexity

133
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:32.900
of the scenario or
the questions involved,

134
00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:38.435
and second was ordered
in a manner that

135
00:06:38.435 --> 00:06:44.465
was apparent from previous data

136
00:06:44.465 --> 00:06:46.760
and previous comments
that we've made.

137
00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:49.730
The millennials segment also has

138
00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:52.715
specific attitudes
toward this idea

139
00:06:52.715 --> 00:06:59.000
of knowledge, transparency,
and communication.

140
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.860
In some research published

141
00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:02.050
in the Journal of
Financial Planning,

142
00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:03.950
Johnson and Larson
reported results from

143
00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:05.900
a survey of millennials on

144
00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:08.540
the attributes of financial
advisors that were most

145
00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:11.780
important and they dichotomized
under two scenarios.

146
00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:13.550
One, where there is
a simple decision

147
00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:15.320
to be made and a second

148
00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:17.120
where the information
was complex and

149
00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:19.460
the decision was complex.

150
00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:23.150
I've highlighted the statistically
significant attributes

151
00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:25.010
and the table is

152
00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:27.515
sorted in descending
order of importance

153
00:07:27.515 --> 00:07:31.330
attributes that were
rated most important.

154
00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:34.200
By way of statistical
significance,

155
00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:39.235
it was knowledge and
friendliness that dominated

156
00:07:39.235 --> 00:07:41.240
and of course to

157
00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:44.810
a lesser extent the
degree advanced training,

158
00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:47.420
and so on were important.

159
00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:49.880
In other words, one
instrumental and one

160
00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:54.650
effective characteristic
of advisors.

161
00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:59.150
Note that in a high
complexity scenario,

162
00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:01.190
friendliness and
approachability which

163
00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:02.480
we equate roughly with

164
00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:07.345
safety was more important
than technical capacity.

165
00:08:07.345 --> 00:08:11.615
For a low complexity
financial planning scenario,

166
00:08:11.615 --> 00:08:15.170
again at more than the margin,

167
00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:17.090
latest financial techniques and

168
00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:19.220
models were rated most highly.

169
00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:21.560
This gives insight into
some of the challenges of

170
00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:24.335
FinTech when it's distinct

171
00:08:24.335 --> 00:08:26.885
from the human element

172
00:08:26.885 --> 00:08:28.520
highlighting the importance of

173
00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:31.190
the bionic model in FinTech.

174
00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:33.980
To summarize it in one more way,

175
00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:39.005
when high complexity
scenarios were at stake,

176
00:08:39.005 --> 00:08:41.660
the human element dominated when

177
00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:44.075
low complexity scenarios
were at stake.

178
00:08:44.075 --> 00:08:47.210
The technical element dominated

179
00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:51.300
although they were both
important across the board.

180
00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:54.550
In addition, Trust and Constant

181
00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:57.310
Contact has been born
out as being highly

182
00:08:57.310 --> 00:09:00.850
important across scenarios for

183
00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:03.700
clients of financial
advisory firms.

184
00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:05.650
Shmeiser and Hogarth,
a couple of years ago

185
00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:07.810
found that financial
advice increases

186
00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:10.360
financial well-being
broadly construed

187
00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:12.100
by way of perception and

188
00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:14.290
also has an influential effect

189
00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:16.825
on financial behaviors
in a positive direction.

190
00:09:16.825 --> 00:09:19.645
So financial advice
was important.

191
00:09:19.645 --> 00:09:22.690
That seems like a predicate
in the FinTech world.

192
00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:26.530
Second, trust was a function

193
00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:31.765
of age and with
contact in particular.

194
00:09:31.765 --> 00:09:34.135
These results which were

195
00:09:34.135 --> 00:09:37.030
developed in an ongoing way
as recovery from

196
00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:40.720
the financial crisis
was happening found

197
00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:43.345
that especially
among retired people

198
00:09:43.345 --> 00:09:44.560
trust levels were low.

199
00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:47.905
However, trust levels
were especially low

200
00:09:47.905 --> 00:09:53.470
when clients had
not been contacted

201
00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:57.730
by financial advisors
recently either because they

202
00:09:57.730 --> 00:09:59.980
hadn't been contacted
proactively or they

203
00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:03.010
hadn't sought out advice.

204
00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:07.855
The results suggest here
that a proactive element

205
00:10:07.855 --> 00:10:10.210
of FinTech advisory
just like it is

206
00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:13.450
for human advisory
will be important.

207
00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:18.580
Now, the FinTech platforms
that we discussed and

208
00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:20.710
you've heard about or
will hear about in

209
00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:23.710
other lectures or in
your travels and travails,

210
00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:26.695
are not purely human

211
00:10:26.695 --> 00:10:28.990
in orientation by
definition you might say.

212
00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:31.855
Although some might
have bionic approaches,

213
00:10:31.855 --> 00:10:34.450
they don't necessarily
distinguish

214
00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:38.050
themselves by being not tech.

215
00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:39.460
They're by definition tech.

216
00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:42.220
So the question then
arises what do we

217
00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:44.830
know about trust not in humans

218
00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:47.110
as you just heard with respect
to financial advisors but

219
00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:50.545
specifically with
respect to algorithms?

220
00:10:50.545 --> 00:10:52.240
In a fascinating bit

221
00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:53.710
of research published
in the Journal of

222
00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:57.190
Experimental Psychology
and elsewhere, Dietvorst,

223
00:10:57.190 --> 00:11:01.960
Simmons and Massey in a pen
working paper discovered

224
00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:07.005
that people displayed
algorithm aversion

225
00:11:07.005 --> 00:11:10.390
and the article is titled
Algorithm Aversion.

226
00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:14.650
People erroneously avoid
algorithms after seeing them.

227
00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:16.360
In this groundbreaking research,

228
00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:17.755
they found that people prefer

229
00:11:17.755 --> 00:11:21.085
humans over algorithms generally.

230
00:11:21.085 --> 00:11:22.810
That may sound strange in a

231
00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:24.760
FinTech lecture but
it sometimes needs

232
00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:26.065
to be confronted for anyone

233
00:11:26.065 --> 00:11:28.015
who is interested in the space,

234
00:11:28.015 --> 00:11:31.570
who is investing in the space,

235
00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:35.260
who is working in
the space and so on.

236
00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.300
They also found that
trust in algorithms is

237
00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:40.420
lower when humans
view them at work.

238
00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:42.610
In other words, before they

239
00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:45.340
see algorithms work
they trust them more

240
00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:47.740
than afterward even
if they're better

241
00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:50.830
than competing
human technologies.

242
00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:54.940
Finally, they found that when

243
00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:56.770
an algorithm was
perceived to make

244
00:11:56.770 --> 00:11:59.455
a mistake it was especially bad.

245
00:11:59.455 --> 00:12:05.875
So in other words, people
like people over algorithms.

246
00:12:05.875 --> 00:12:08.500
When people watch
an algorithm work they

247
00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:10.900
trust it less even if
the algorithm is producing

248
00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:13.015
better results than humans

249
00:12:13.015 --> 00:12:14.500
and then when an algorithm makes

250
00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:16.135
mistakes it's especially bad.

251
00:12:16.135 --> 00:12:20.950
In their study, the authors
focused on predictions of

252
00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:23.890
MBA application success and on

253
00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:24.925
forecast a number of

254
00:12:24.925 --> 00:12:27.925
airline passengers in
the airline industry.

255
00:12:27.925 --> 00:12:32.005
In each case, they asked

256
00:12:32.005 --> 00:12:36.070
participants in
their study to make

257
00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:40.960
forecasts either of application
success or of a number of

258
00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:43.270
airline passengers
and compared that

259
00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:46.480
to quantitative models
that they manipulated.

260
00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:50.875
In their studies of
MBA students performance,

261
00:12:50.875 --> 00:12:54.460
they allowed participants to

262
00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:57.760
witness results of
what they called

263
00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:01.180
humans forecasts and
then forecasts of

264
00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:03.190
student performance
that they described to

265
00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:07.030
participants as
coming from models.

266
00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:11.934
When the forecasts were
described as coming from humans,

267
00:13:11.934 --> 00:13:14.530
they saw no difference in

268
00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:18.235
the selection of participants
to use humans forecasts.

269
00:13:18.235 --> 00:13:19.930
You can see that in study one

270
00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:22.630
because there's
no palpable difference between

271
00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:27.295
a control random oriented
choice selection

272
00:13:27.295 --> 00:13:31.405
and those that saw results
of the humans forecasts.

273
00:13:31.405 --> 00:13:36.850
However, when
participants witnessed

274
00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:41.530
results of forecasts
for models whether

275
00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:42.760
the models were better or

276
00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:45.370
not but even when the models were

277
00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:48.070
better their selection of them

278
00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:51.440
aka their trust of them declined.

279
00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:53.940
You can see the numbers
in the control went from

280
00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:57.270
65 percent and 63 percent based

281
00:13:57.270 --> 00:14:00.390
on the first treatment of

282
00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:04.600
those participants
choosing the next round to

283
00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:08.380
be a statistical model
compared to what

284
00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:10.450
happened after they
actually saw the models

285
00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:13.645
forecast or the models
and humans forecasts.

286
00:14:13.645 --> 00:14:18.415
Same thing is repeated in
study number four which

287
00:14:18.415 --> 00:14:23.080
incorporated their
own forecasts as well

288
00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:26.500
as another human and

289
00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:29.230
perhaps because this might

290
00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:31.780
have been a cooked
MBA student example,

291
00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:33.535
they looked at forecasting

292
00:14:33.535 --> 00:14:35.170
the number of
airline passengers in

293
00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:36.955
the United States a kind of

294
00:14:36.955 --> 00:14:41.300
exterior problem the
same exact results.

295
00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:46.930
When asked to select
a statistical model or

296
00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:49.150
a human model when they

297
00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:52.060
saw the results of
a human's forecasts,

298
00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:53.770
there were just over 50 percent

299
00:14:53.770 --> 00:14:56.125
likely to choose
the statistical model.

300
00:14:56.125 --> 00:14:57.355
However, when they saw

301
00:14:57.355 --> 00:14:59.680
a statistical model they

302
00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:01.915
were more likely to
choose the human forecast

303
00:15:01.915 --> 00:15:04.390
56 percent with
a 41 percent for choosing

304
00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:06.940
a statistical model and
that's also true when

305
00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:10.075
they saw both humans and

306
00:15:10.075 --> 00:15:13.450
statistical model
algorithmic forecasts

307
00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:16.940
when the model outperform humans.

308
00:15:17.190 --> 00:15:22.840
It's an incredibly powerful
result across the board.

309
00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:27.145
More than that, your belief

310
00:15:27.145 --> 00:15:30.730
in advance was a function
of whether you

311
00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:32.950
saw a model or

312
00:15:32.950 --> 00:15:38.485
a statistical algorithm perform
even if again was better.

313
00:15:38.485 --> 00:15:42.925
So your confidence in
advance made a difference.

314
00:15:42.925 --> 00:15:45.340
If you look at the far right
of the graph in front of

315
00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:47.830
you when participants described

316
00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:49.210
themselves as being much more

317
00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:52.480
confident in a model in advance,

318
00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:57.985
they were 82 percent likely
if you will to choose

319
00:15:57.985 --> 00:16:00.670
a model and that
converged across whether

320
00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:04.120
you saw the model perform or
whether you didn't see it.

321
00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:08.110
However, if you were not
confident in advance,

322
00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:10.750
and you saw the model

323
00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:14.290
perform you are significantly
less likely to choose it,

324
00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:18.100
13 percent compared to
39 percent were more confident.

325
00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:21.985
In the other dimension
across confidence,

326
00:16:21.985 --> 00:16:24.160
again, if you were more

327
00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:27.505
confident of the model you're
more likely to choose it.

328
00:16:27.505 --> 00:16:30.100
So how could we bring this
together for FinTech?

329
00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:32.170
Well, number one we see
how important trust

330
00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:35.230
is and the variance of
trust at least in part.

331
00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:38.980
Second, in the FinTech
context we might

332
00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:42.505
translate this notion of trust
into trust of algorithms.

333
00:16:42.505 --> 00:16:45.460
What do we know there?
Algorithmic aversion exists.

334
00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:48.880
People don't choose algorithms
over humans once they see

335
00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:50.590
the algorithm in action

336
00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:53.380
even if the algorithm
beats people.

337
00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:55.855
They may choose the algorithm
if they haven't seen

338
00:16:55.855 --> 00:16:59.125
any results even if those
results are better than theirs.

339
00:16:59.125 --> 00:17:02.980
If algorithms make
mistakes and people see

340
00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:07.435
them they strongly avoid
the use of the algorithm.

341
00:17:07.435 --> 00:17:09.790
Interestingly enough the authors
of the piece we just

342
00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:13.690
mentioned followed on and found

343
00:17:13.690 --> 00:17:15.430
that if they could change
the algorithms let's

344
00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:17.320
say participants if
people can change

345
00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:20.500
the algorithm even
a small bit after

346
00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:22.060
seeing its performance they're

347
00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:24.160
more likely to use the algorithm.

348
00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:28.090
So it looks like in some sense
combining judgment with

349
00:17:28.090 --> 00:17:30.070
the algorithm helped them feel

350
00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:33.740
confident and trusting
of the algorithm itself.

351
00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:37.230
This reflects some pretty
interesting work summarized in

352
00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:38.310
a well-known paper in

353
00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:41.550
science in the late
80's by Dawes, Faust,

354
00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:45.190
and Meehl called Clinical
Versus Actuarial Judgment in

355
00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:47.750
which in a meta-analytic approach

356
00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:50.240
the authors described how

357
00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:52.625
actuarial approaches called them

358
00:17:52.625 --> 00:17:55.969
algorithmic approaches in
many different contexts

359
00:17:55.969 --> 00:17:58.790
beat clinical or
human-oriented approaches

360
00:17:58.790 --> 00:18:01.935
including judging
people's personalities,

361
00:18:01.935 --> 00:18:05.175
making parole
violation predictions,

362
00:18:05.175 --> 00:18:08.785
diagnosing progressive
brain dysfunction,

363
00:18:08.785 --> 00:18:12.065
understanding and diagnosing
Hodgkin's disease,

364
00:18:12.065 --> 00:18:14.315
forecasting college grades,

365
00:18:14.315 --> 00:18:16.745
diagnosing psychological
disorders,

366
00:18:16.745 --> 00:18:20.255
understanding hospitalization
times and numerous others.

367
00:18:20.255 --> 00:18:23.960
The actuarial approach dominated

368
00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:26.690
the clinical approach
although they did find that

369
00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:29.330
the combination of actuarial and
clinical approaches

370
00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:30.990
dominated all the others.

371
00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:35.030
There were several reasons:
consistency or its

372
00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:37.370
converse for humans inconsistency

373
00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:40.873
across time, across scenarios,

374
00:18:40.873 --> 00:18:44.360
across states of mind
of the protagonist.

375
00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:46.700
Actuarial approaches tended to be

376
00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:49.205
more rational and rules-based.

377
00:18:49.205 --> 00:18:52.805
They allowed formal rational
weighting of inputs.

378
00:18:52.805 --> 00:18:54.680
They included all kinds of

379
00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:58.490
relevant variables and
excluded irrelevant variables.

380
00:18:58.490 --> 00:19:02.165
Sample biases of
clinical approaches

381
00:19:02.165 --> 00:19:04.525
are often large in number,

382
00:19:04.525 --> 00:19:08.210
limited samples, skewed exposure
to treated cases.

383
00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:11.405
Doctors for example
see only the sick

384
00:19:11.405 --> 00:19:15.500
as opposed to a controlled
sample and so on.

385
00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:18.710
One area where it was found that

386
00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:20.030
the combination of actuary

387
00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:22.010
clinical approaches
dominated others

388
00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:23.330
was in the area of
what we call the

389
00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:25.265
broken leg problem or

390
00:19:25.265 --> 00:19:27.800
the recognition of
extreme outliers in which

391
00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:30.140
clinicians were shown to

392
00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:32.705
have better predictive
capabilities.

393
00:19:32.705 --> 00:19:35.465
But the idea that
the combination of

394
00:19:35.465 --> 00:19:39.155
humans and machine might
give the best result

395
00:19:39.155 --> 00:19:42.980
is highly supportive of
the FinTech proposition in

396
00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:46.115
some ways especially
as it relates to

397
00:19:46.115 --> 00:19:50.900
trust in algorithms and
ultimate outcome for clients.
