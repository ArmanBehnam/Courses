1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.681
Electro and fintech,
robo-advisory insurance tech,

2
00:00:05.681 --> 00:00:09.942
and related disciplines would be woefully

3
00:00:09.942 --> 00:00:14.922
incomplete without talking
about Millennials.

4
00:00:14.922 --> 00:00:19.842
In part because the financial
advisory insurances and other fintech

5
00:00:19.842 --> 00:00:25.120
industries are so keenly aware of how
important the Millennials will be.

6
00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.408
In part because they're
going to be inheriting so

7
00:00:28.408 --> 00:00:33.040
much wealth, and because of their
very fast adoption of technology.

8
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.110
In the words, of one fintech founder,

9
00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.700
a major fintech founder,
they're going to disrupt the industry.

10
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:45.900
They're going to target clients and
in particular,

11
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:51.022
they're going to target Millennials.

12
00:00:51.022 --> 00:00:55.080
I asked this founder, are they
going to pursue a bionic approach,

13
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.062
a fully bionic approach,
and the answer was no.

14
00:00:58.062 --> 00:01:02.677
And in fact, this particular
robo-advisor founder wants all

15
00:01:02.677 --> 00:01:05.559
advisors non-robo-oriented dead.

16
00:01:05.559 --> 00:01:08.806
It's a strong statement,
how's it going to do it?

17
00:01:08.806 --> 00:01:13.258
He's going to wait until Millennials
inherit the wealth having

18
00:01:13.258 --> 00:01:17.119
captured their hearts and
minds early as customers.

19
00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:21.297
Millennials are those individuals born
generally in the late 1970s through

20
00:01:21.297 --> 00:01:22.471
the mid-1990s.

21
00:01:22.471 --> 00:01:27.599
There are various definitions,
some describe them as being born in 77

22
00:01:27.599 --> 00:01:33.500
through 1995, but they're roughly 20
to 40 years old give or take a year.

23
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.491
And of course, there are many
gradations of those Millennials.

24
00:01:37.491 --> 00:01:42.389
And of course, we're also abstracting
fairly broad when talk about them.

25
00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:47.781
But as many know very well, they represent
large portions of the US population.

26
00:01:47.781 --> 00:01:54.183
Almost 85 million members of the US
population as of 2015 that's 25%

27
00:01:54.183 --> 00:02:00.207
of the US population, would be
self-defined as Millennials globally.

28
00:02:00.207 --> 00:02:04.879
It's even a larger proportion,
just about 40 percent of the global adult

29
00:02:04.879 --> 00:02:08.458
population in 2015 we would
classify as Millennial.

30
00:02:08.458 --> 00:02:12.493
Nielsen's, the well-known
consumer research organization,

31
00:02:12.493 --> 00:02:16.608
describe Millennials as diverse,
expressive, and optimistic.

32
00:02:16.608 --> 00:02:21.511
They have a number of differentiations
within their own demographic

33
00:02:21.511 --> 00:02:23.294
including with income.

34
00:02:23.294 --> 00:02:28.673
The medium income was $25,000 for
those under 28 years old,

35
00:02:28.673 --> 00:02:35.623
and for those above about $50,000 just
about twice the younger Millennial level.

36
00:02:35.623 --> 00:02:39.808
25% were married in 2015 that contrasts

37
00:02:39.808 --> 00:02:44.829
strongly with previous
generations like Baby Boomers,

38
00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:50.180
who saw 42% of their demographic
married to the same age.

39
00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.516
They're also more ethnically and racially
diverse than previous generations.

40
00:02:55.516 --> 00:02:57.522
Interestingly enough,

41
00:02:57.522 --> 00:03:03.355
they are not poorer on an asset level
compared to previous generations.

42
00:03:03.355 --> 00:03:10.069
Nielsen reports a greater percentage of
double millionaires are Millennials 14.7%

43
00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:15.292
than Gen X and
Young Boomers 12.9% in 11.8% respectively.

44
00:03:15.292 --> 00:03:19.363
This has clear implications for
the statement that I mentioned about

45
00:03:19.363 --> 00:03:22.885
capturing the hearts of minds
of Millennials and waiting.

46
00:03:22.885 --> 00:03:28.297
The wealth distribution of
Millennials is broad and

47
00:03:28.297 --> 00:03:35.684
diverse and to be distinguished from
the wealth of other generations.

48
00:03:35.684 --> 00:03:40.686
The Nielsen data stratify those who
are Millennials, which they defined as

49
00:03:40.686 --> 00:03:45.532
those under 35, Generation X 35 to 44,
Boomers on the young side,

50
00:03:45.532 --> 00:03:51.239
45 to 54, older Baby Boomers essentially
traditionally retirement age anyway,

51
00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:54.365
55 to 64, and then the Silent Generation,

52
00:03:54.365 --> 00:03:58.299
sometimes known as
the Greatest Generation 65 or above.

53
00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:03.079
Millennials are in the blue,
what we see is that a larger

54
00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:07.964
proportion of Millennial
millionaires exists as of that

55
00:04:07.964 --> 00:04:12.867
date compared to Generation X or
the Young Baby Boomers.

56
00:04:12.867 --> 00:04:18.861
However, and there's a much
larger proportion of Millennials

57
00:04:18.861 --> 00:04:24.863
who have under $25,000 in total wealth,
about 24%.

58
00:04:24.863 --> 00:04:27.881
In other words, they are more diverse and

59
00:04:27.881 --> 00:04:31.255
are more diverse especially
in the extremes.

60
00:04:31.255 --> 00:04:36.077
To say it one more way,
they represent at the same age

61
00:04:36.077 --> 00:04:41.120
lower levels of wealth except
in the millionaire class

62
00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:46.287
as we look at the broader
general wealth distribution.

63
00:04:46.287 --> 00:04:50.822
In addition, Millennials have
what we might characterize as

64
00:04:50.822 --> 00:04:54.058
a skeptical view toward financial advice.

65
00:04:54.058 --> 00:04:59.000
They are generally characterized as
having optimism about their future.

66
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.842
Yet half Millennials think
there will be no money for

67
00:05:01.842 --> 00:05:06.439
them from government subsistence programs
like Social Security when they retire.

68
00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:11.655
Only 6% of Millennials expect
to receive Social Security

69
00:05:11.655 --> 00:05:17.822
payments at levels available to
current retirees in a recent survey.

70
00:05:17.822 --> 00:05:19.237
According to US Trust,

71
00:05:19.237 --> 00:05:24.191
about two-thirds of millennial see their
investment decisions as a way to express

72
00:05:24.191 --> 00:05:28.030
impact in a way that goes beyond
purely that which is financial.

73
00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:34.238
In other words, environmental social
political values may be expressed,

74
00:05:34.238 --> 00:05:39.672
in by way of impact investing or
ESG investing using their assets.

75
00:05:39.672 --> 00:05:44.508
Meanwhile, in 2015 a survey held
that one-third of advisers are not

76
00:05:44.508 --> 00:05:47.394
likely to represent an impact investment.

77
00:05:47.394 --> 00:05:52.090
In other words, there seems to be
a mismatch between traditional advisory

78
00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:55.528
practices in the hearts and
the minds of Millennials.

79
00:05:55.528 --> 00:05:59.001
That having been said in other words,

80
00:05:59.001 --> 00:06:04.220
70% advisers are reporting
inquiries about impact.

81
00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:09.541
Additional recent data tell us that
about 70% of Millennials here,

82
00:06:09.541 --> 00:06:14.153
defined as those born in 81
through 96 belying this slight

83
00:06:14.153 --> 00:06:19.401
disagreement about the range that
covers Millennial birth cohorts.

84
00:06:19.401 --> 00:06:24.185
Felt confident and well prepared
to handle the money that they

85
00:06:24.185 --> 00:06:28.056
will either earn or
inherit from their families.

86
00:06:28.056 --> 00:06:34.629
That distinguishes themselves dramatically
from previous generations at the same age.

87
00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:40.860
For example, 73% of Generation Xers,
86% of Boomers, and almost 90% for

88
00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:46.140
the Silent Generation felt confident
to handle their families money.

89
00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:50.254
However, 80% of Millennials
own a smartphone.

90
00:06:50.254 --> 00:06:54.921
90% Millennials check their smartphones
within the first 15 minutes of waking up.

91
00:06:54.921 --> 00:06:56.393
What are they doing?

92
00:06:56.393 --> 00:06:58.761
They're checking social networks.

93
00:06:58.761 --> 00:07:04.470
They're also extremely entrepreneurial,
more than half in the reported surveys,

94
00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:08.987
and that comes from US Trust,
Deloitte, and the Federal Reserve,

95
00:07:08.987 --> 00:07:12.653
have started a business plan or
their own businesses.

96
00:07:12.653 --> 00:07:17.688
Just under 30% report being
self-employed in some way.

97
00:07:17.688 --> 00:07:22.354
That having been said, some recent
research from the Federal Reserve Bank of

98
00:07:22.354 --> 00:07:24.866
St. Louis in its income stability unit,

99
00:07:24.866 --> 00:07:29.701
has found that 60% of US Millennials
have zero exposure to public equities.

100
00:07:29.701 --> 00:07:34.437
That may be inherently contrasted
with the fact that they may own

101
00:07:34.437 --> 00:07:39.004
their own businesses or
have entrepreneurial aspirations.

102
00:07:39.004 --> 00:07:42.575
When they do hold public market equities,

103
00:07:42.575 --> 00:07:47.438
they hold only about $7,600
which is significantly

104
00:07:47.438 --> 00:07:51.717
lower than the Gen X reported
value at the same age.

105
00:07:51.717 --> 00:07:56.610
Millennial households had
an average net worth of $90,000

106
00:07:56.610 --> 00:08:00.017
in 2016 compared to $130,000 for

107
00:08:00.017 --> 00:08:05.270
Generation X in 2001, in other words,
once again at the same age.

108
00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:08.735
The Federal Reserve data found
that 81% of Millennial workers

109
00:08:08.735 --> 00:08:11.706
don't believe Social Security
will be there for them.

110
00:08:11.706 --> 00:08:17.502
And in fact more than half expect nothing,
this is from the Pew Research Center.

111
00:08:17.502 --> 00:08:22.000
More than that more Millennials
believe in UFOs than believe that

112
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.215
Social Security will persist.

113
00:08:24.215 --> 00:08:29.118
And yet they are optimistic about
their own personal future and

114
00:08:29.118 --> 00:08:33.572
their desire and
ability to matter in the world at large.

115
00:08:33.572 --> 00:08:36.269
However, trust is an issue, which for

116
00:08:36.269 --> 00:08:41.337
those of us who live to the great
financial crisis, and market shocks that

117
00:08:41.337 --> 00:08:46.427
were potentially viewed by Millennials,
is not that much of a surprise.

118
00:08:46.427 --> 00:08:51.509
A characteristic of Millennials is
a perennial low level of trust,

119
00:08:51.509 --> 00:08:54.182
not in themselves, but in others,

120
00:08:54.182 --> 00:08:58.741
the Pew Research Center has
been tracking this for decades.

121
00:08:58.741 --> 00:09:03.231
What we see when we look at
the Boomer Generation versus

122
00:09:03.231 --> 00:09:08.210
the Silent Generation and
Gen X is, as time has progressed,

123
00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:13.187
and as they have been at younger
ages more exposed to dramatic

124
00:09:13.187 --> 00:09:17.701
volatility in markets,
trust levels have gone down.

125
00:09:17.701 --> 00:09:22.880
What you see here is from a question
asking, generally speaking,

126
00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:28.149
would you say that most people can
be trusted or that you can't be too

127
00:09:28.149 --> 00:09:33.992
careful in dealing with people asked
of respondents in those categories?

128
00:09:33.992 --> 00:09:39.539
Recently, 40% of Boomers respond
responded that generally speaking

129
00:09:39.539 --> 00:09:45.539
most people can be trusted, 37% of
the Silent Generation, 31% of Gen X.

130
00:09:45.539 --> 00:09:49.959
However, less than 20% of the Millennial

131
00:09:49.959 --> 00:09:55.091
respondents responded that
people can be trusted.

132
00:09:55.091 --> 00:10:00.171
However, while they may be skeptical and
less trusting about others,

133
00:10:00.171 --> 00:10:04.659
and although they may generally
have lower levels of wealth and

134
00:10:04.659 --> 00:10:08.555
income currently compared
to previous generations,

135
00:10:08.555 --> 00:10:14.757
they are nonetheless the most optimistic
generation about their financial futures.

136
00:10:14.757 --> 00:10:20.681
The research from the Pew Center we
mentioned a second ago revealed that

137
00:10:20.681 --> 00:10:26.717
only 32% of Millennials said they
currently have enough to live now.

138
00:10:26.717 --> 00:10:31.185
That compares and contrasts really
strongly with Gen X, Boomers, and

139
00:10:31.185 --> 00:10:35.432
the Silent Generation respondents
approximately 40% of with,

140
00:10:35.432 --> 00:10:40.423
45% of which, and 54% of which responded
that they currently have enough

141
00:10:40.423 --> 00:10:42.897
to live the kind of life that they want.

142
00:10:42.897 --> 00:10:47.746
However, while they don't learn
have enough now they expect to in

143
00:10:47.746 --> 00:10:52.251
the future 53% of Millennials
responded in the positive,

144
00:10:52.251 --> 00:10:55.725
whereas 15% of Boomers
said the same thing.

145
00:10:55.725 --> 00:11:00.693
Now, of course, there are age and cohort
effects here, but it is undeniable that

146
00:11:00.693 --> 00:11:04.877
Millennials are at a base level
optimistic about their own futures.

147
00:11:04.877 --> 00:11:09.563
They're optimistic about themselves,
they're optimistic about what the future

148
00:11:09.563 --> 00:11:13.457
may hold, and they're optimistic
about their place in history, and

149
00:11:13.457 --> 00:11:17.298
their ability and their opportunity
to matter in the world at large.

150
00:11:17.298 --> 00:11:22.982
So then why does fintech hold promise for
Millennial customers?

151
00:11:22.982 --> 00:11:28.589
Well, in part it's because of their
adoption of technology which has increased

152
00:11:28.589 --> 00:11:33.545
over time, it differentiates itself
from adoption by other cohorts.

153
00:11:33.545 --> 00:11:38.519
The Federal Reserve Board of
Governors continued their research

154
00:11:38.519 --> 00:11:41.866
in a recent survey
focusing on consumers and

155
00:11:41.866 --> 00:11:47.384
mobile financial services,
highlighting the use of mobile banking and

156
00:11:47.384 --> 00:11:51.646
mobile payments in an amplified context,
so to speak.

157
00:11:51.646 --> 00:11:57.605
The younger Millennial generation here
listed as 18 to 29 was the greatest

158
00:11:57.605 --> 00:12:03.216
adopter of both mobile banking and
mobile payments in the survey period.

159
00:12:03.216 --> 00:12:08.116
And of course, as we move along
the age distribution from younger

160
00:12:08.116 --> 00:12:13.018
older in any given period covered
by the survey, which range from

161
00:12:13.018 --> 00:12:18.007
2011 to 2015, we see that we
have decreasing adoption and

162
00:12:18.007 --> 00:12:21.325
use of mobile banking and mobile payments.

163
00:12:21.325 --> 00:12:25.403
Let's first treat the time pattern,
let's take for

164
00:12:25.403 --> 00:12:29.672
example the Millennial
young generation 18 to 29.

165
00:12:29.672 --> 00:12:37.252
We see in 2011, 45% of that cohort use
mobile banking, 20% use mobile payments.

166
00:12:37.252 --> 00:12:41.144
By the end of 2015,
it had gone to almost 70% for

167
00:12:41.144 --> 00:12:45.048
mobile banking and
about 30% for mobile payments.

168
00:12:45.048 --> 00:12:51.279
That's an increase of 50% for
mobile payments and

169
00:12:51.279 --> 00:12:55.299
about 40% for mobile banking.

170
00:12:55.299 --> 00:13:00.639
As we go from the 18 to 29-year-old
cohort, to the 45 to 59 or

171
00:13:00.639 --> 00:13:06.450
the 60 plus cohort, we see a small
fraction of the same level of adoption.

172
00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:11.266
It is not the case that adoption
of financial technology by

173
00:13:11.266 --> 00:13:15.984
way of mobile apps is
a Millennial-only phenomenon, or

174
00:13:15.984 --> 00:13:20.899
the growth rate can be only
attributed to Millennials, but

175
00:13:20.899 --> 00:13:24.557
it's predominantly a Millennial thrust.

176
00:13:24.557 --> 00:13:28.929
For example,
if we look at the 60 plus cohort in 2011,

177
00:13:28.929 --> 00:13:34.955
only 5% reported using mobile banking
apps and 5% reported using mobile apps.

178
00:13:34.955 --> 00:13:40.516
By 2015, that had gone to almost 20% for

179
00:13:40.516 --> 00:13:46.912
mobile banking and
about 13% for mobile payments,

180
00:13:46.912 --> 00:13:52.211
a strong contrast with
the younger cohorts.

181
00:13:52.211 --> 00:13:57.532
So Millennials are reported by researchers
to be optimistic, to be diverse,

182
00:13:57.532 --> 00:14:01.897
to be interested in how they fit
into the world and their impact.

183
00:14:01.897 --> 00:14:06.681
They are viewed to be
optimistic about their futures,

184
00:14:06.681 --> 00:14:11.777
although they may as a matter of fact,
have less financial

185
00:14:11.777 --> 00:14:16.882
capability currently and
they've adopted technology.

186
00:14:16.882 --> 00:14:21.286
As a side question, but one that turns
out to be fairly important we might ask,

187
00:14:21.286 --> 00:14:23.511
where do the time variation come from?

188
00:14:23.511 --> 00:14:28.357
Sociologists certainly will continue
to research the matter, but

189
00:14:28.357 --> 00:14:33.544
we do have some knowledge from our
understanding of the implications and

190
00:14:33.544 --> 00:14:36.870
the impact of market
volatility on behavior.

191
00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:39.913
That's the area of risk aversion or
risk tolerance.

192
00:14:39.913 --> 00:14:43.872
And it turns out that with respect
to the millennial cohort, but

193
00:14:43.872 --> 00:14:48.567
also more generally market volatility
has probably changed behavior, and

194
00:14:48.567 --> 00:14:50.343
we can see it in the numbers.
