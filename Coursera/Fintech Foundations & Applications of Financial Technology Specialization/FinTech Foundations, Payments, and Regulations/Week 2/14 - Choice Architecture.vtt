00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.060
Understanding the evolution of

2
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.525
FinTech both its
present and its future,

3
00:00:09.525 --> 00:00:12.390
necessarily requires
mentioning the idea

4
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.015
of choice architecture
and the challenge that

5
00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:19.530
consumers or purchases
a FinTech products and

6
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:23.970
services might have in
selecting their purchases.

7
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.030
For example, in a robo

8
00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.815
advisory contexts selecting
elements within a portfolio.

9
00:00:28.815 --> 00:00:31.890
One of the solutions that
have been offered again in

10
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.920
the robo advisory space are
pre-selected portfolios.

11
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.420
Where do those come from?

12
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.385
Why do they have three
choices versus 30 choices?

13
00:00:41.385 --> 00:00:44.780
Well, choice architecture
and the challenge of

14
00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.690
computation burdens
when the number of

15
00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.870
choices is large becomes
really important.

16
00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.270
Again, FinTech has
its own challenges

17
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.720
both with a number of
possibilities out there,

18
00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.670
how many apps on
the App Store related to

19
00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.840
FinTech at this
point as an example,

20
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.260
but also the underlying
number of choices

21
00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.510
within the palette of potentials.

22
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.405
Well, complexity matters when

23
00:01:11.405 --> 00:01:13.565
numerous choices are available.

24
00:01:13.565 --> 00:01:18.140
Research over many years
has suggested that showing

25
00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.945
"Too much information Can

26
00:01:20.945 --> 00:01:23.195
affect the way
the choices are made.

27
00:01:23.195 --> 00:01:25.340
It can skew risk perceptions.

28
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.580
It can slow or make

29
00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.065
impossible decisions
and decision-making.

30
00:01:33.065 --> 00:01:35.360
It can also impact
the way people feel

31
00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.335
about their decisions and make
them less happy about it."

32
00:01:38.335 --> 00:01:42.640
For example, Diacon and
Hasseldine a couple years ago,

33
00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.050
found that investors
are more likely to

34
00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.330
take risk when shown

35
00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.270
presentations over longer
periods than when presented

36
00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.360
with succession of
short period returns.

37
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.820
In other words, one single
longer-term representation

38
00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:05.270
of results, allowed clients
or investors to make

39
00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.730
decisions more easily than

40
00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.370
a large number of
shorter period returns.

41
00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.000
Other studies have suggested

42
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.890
that when faced
with many choices,

43
00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.620
investors choose
not to participate.

44
00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.130
In a famous study
of 401(k) defined

45
00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.400
contribution plans over a large
number of participants,

46
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.425
almost a million participants,

47
00:02:27.425 --> 00:02:31.595
across 660 companies,
the number of

48
00:02:31.595 --> 00:02:33.980
choices as they increased

49
00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.890
caused decision or
decision-making paralysis,

50
00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.990
we call it analysis paralysis.

51
00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.605
For every increase
in options by 10,

52
00:02:42.605 --> 00:02:46.100
overall participation
in retirement plans

53
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.310
themselves declined
by two percent.

54
00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.065
Framing decision-making thus
turns out to be important.

55
00:02:54.065 --> 00:02:58.190
In addition, complexity
interacts with trust.

56
00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.920
First, not having an answer

57
00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.095
leads to declining
trust and second,

58
00:03:03.095 --> 00:03:05.030
when the client asks

59
00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.600
a question involving
a complex scenario,

60
00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.515
a product service and so on,

61
00:03:11.515 --> 00:03:15.100
if an advisor did
not know an answer,

62
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.525
it was better than
making up an answer.

63
00:03:17.525 --> 00:03:19.700
In well-known study, Bickart and

64
00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.310
co-authors conducted
a series of studies

65
00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.050
in which participants rated
advisors on two scores,

66
00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.120
trustworthiness and
intention to make

67
00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.380
an investment decision
with the advisor per se,

68
00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:34.580
after being presented with

69
00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.290
three answers from the advisor.

70
00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.320
One, absolutely
correct and simple.

71
00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.850
Two, admitting
ignorance and three,

72
00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:45.170
an answer that didn't sound

73
00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.030
right and appeared obfuscatory.

74
00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.995
What they found was that it's

75
00:03:48.995 --> 00:03:51.020
always better for
an adviser to admit

76
00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.750
ignorance than obfuscate
whether the client

77
00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.935
perceives the adviser
earning a commission.

78
00:03:57.935 --> 00:04:01.880
Here are the results of
the study relating complexity

79
00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.665
and clarity to trust and
attention to invest.

80
00:04:06.665 --> 00:04:10.475
This is essentially
a two-by-two matrix

81
00:04:10.475 --> 00:04:11.960
with commission motors on

82
00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.955
the left and no commission
motive on the right.

83
00:04:13.955 --> 00:04:16.405
In other words, fee-only
versus commission,

84
00:04:16.405 --> 00:04:19.205
and then participants who

85
00:04:19.205 --> 00:04:21.080
understood there's
a commission versus

86
00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.590
participant who said
the salesperson

87
00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.700
knew all the answers.

88
00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:31.440
Down at the bottom, we
see intention to invest,

89
00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.239
subsequent to the interaction,

90
00:04:33.239 --> 00:04:35.265
and an overall rating of trust.

91
00:04:35.265 --> 00:04:38.420
Both of these scales range
from one to seven with seven

92
00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:42.575
being greater in trust
or intention than one.

93
00:04:42.575 --> 00:04:47.360
Let's focus on the bottom
in the highlighted box.

94
00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.450
When there was no commission
involved and of course,

95
00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:53.900
we know that in the FinTech
space we have fee-only

96
00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:58.125
in commission oriented
platforms companies.

97
00:04:58.125 --> 00:05:02.130
When a correct answer
was provided, clear,

98
00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:06.200
and simple 4.91 average

99
00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:10.525
rating on the trust scale
was observed,

100
00:05:10.525 --> 00:05:15.710
and a 4.5 rating on
intention to invest.

101
00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:17.990
Note that when a commission was

102
00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:20.360
involved the 4.9 percent average

103
00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.490
dropped to 4.61 and the intention

104
00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:25.805
to invest drop from 4.5 to 4.3,

105
00:05:25.805 --> 00:05:29.340
both of which were
statistically significant.

106
00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:33.470
Then, when we move from

107
00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:38.640
the correct answer simply
expressed to a obfuscatory,

108
00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:43.830
in other words, an unclear
possibly wrong response,

109
00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:45.020
the trust levels once

110
00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.780
again dropped
dramatically especially,

111
00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:49.235
when a commission was involved.

112
00:05:49.235 --> 00:05:50.810
Four point nine one on

113
00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:54.830
the trust scale moved
to 4.34 and then

114
00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.770
4.34 move to 3.66 on

115
00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:59.450
the trust perception scale when

116
00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:01.820
a commission was perceived.

117
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.305
To say it another way,

118
00:06:03.305 --> 00:06:06.110
an obfuscatory response brought

119
00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:09.980
trust perceptions down
and interacted with

120
00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:13.205
the commission motive
in a misalignment of

121
00:06:13.205 --> 00:06:16.700
incentives on behalf of

122
00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:20.195
the adviser as perceived
by the client.

123
00:06:20.195 --> 00:06:26.210
In addition, the attention
to invest went down from

124
00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:33.390
4.5 to 4.36 and then from 4.36
to 3.56 was simply saying,

125
00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:34.890
"I don't know better."

126
00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:38.610
Absolutely. Again, think
about trust perceptions.

127
00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:40.400
They went from, on the right in

128
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.860
the no commission case
from 4.9 to

129
00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:47.895
4.8 and then in
the commission case,

130
00:06:47.895 --> 00:06:52.655
the don't know response
went from 4.8 to 4.42.

131
00:06:52.655 --> 00:06:56.110
In both cases better than
making up a response.

132
00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:59.815
To summarize,
intentions to invest,

133
00:06:59.815 --> 00:07:05.300
perceptions of trust interact
with commissions and

134
00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:11.010
misalign of incentives as
well as how responses happen.

135
00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:12.940
In the FinTech space,

136
00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:16.415
having unclear actions
and unclear responses,

137
00:07:16.415 --> 00:07:18.770
as well as a
heightened sensitivity

138
00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:23.195
to algorithms and potential
mistrust and algorithms,

139
00:07:23.195 --> 00:07:26.030
come together both to represent

140
00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:30.160
a tailwind and a headwind
for the industry.

141
00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.350
So at the end of the day,

142
00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:35.540
what can we say
about what we know

143
00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:37.370
about the FinTech space generally

144
00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:39.245
and in particular
about robo advising.

145
00:07:39.245 --> 00:07:41.135
Well, first it's here to stay

146
00:07:41.135 --> 00:07:43.340
and it's part of the way
the world will work it seems

147
00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:47.450
ineluctable judging from
both supply and demand.

148
00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:50.180
The increasing in size
and number of deals.

149
00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:53.000
The upward general trend

150
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.750
despite some market
cycle variation.

151
00:07:56.750 --> 00:08:00.020
The global nature of
the industry as well

152
00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:03.470
as how it's construed
across sub-components.

153
00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:06.230
All tell us that FinTech as

154
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:09.215
part and parcel of the world
in the way forward.

155
00:08:09.215 --> 00:08:12.120
In addition, millennials matter

156
00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:14.840
in the heart and minds of
millennials which seemed to

157
00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:18.830
be so much in the cross heirs of

158
00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:21.710
financial services firms
already legacy firms as well as

159
00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:25.625
disruptors and
entrepreneurial enterprises,

160
00:08:25.625 --> 00:08:28.580
underscore the avenue
both the supply

161
00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:31.280
and the demand of
FinTech providers.

162
00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:35.420
However, the traditional
notions of trust not

163
00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:37.610
just in the financial
industry but

164
00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:40.970
specifically in what is
special about FinTech,

165
00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:43.909
algorithms and potential exposure

166
00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:46.850
to technology all come together.

167
00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:49.175
Traditional
challenging areas like

168
00:08:49.175 --> 00:08:51.725
those of choice
architecture arise.

169
00:08:51.725 --> 00:08:54.410
It's going to be nothing
different for FinTech.

170
00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:57.740
Successful FinTech
entrepreneurs, investors,

171
00:08:57.740 --> 00:08:59.900
and clients will resolve some of

172
00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:02.780
these challenges and
harness the tailwinds while

173
00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:05.240
confronting both
the classical and

174
00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:08.215
the new headwinds that
are facing the industry.

175
00:09:08.215 --> 00:09:12.530
Almost surely, there will
be winners and losers.

176
00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:16.280
Those that win will
accommodate and treat

177
00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:18.320
these challenges and
they'll harness some

178
00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:21.390
of them for the future
