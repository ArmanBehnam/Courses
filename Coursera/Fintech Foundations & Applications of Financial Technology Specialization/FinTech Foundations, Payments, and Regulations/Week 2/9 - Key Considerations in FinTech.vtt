1
00:00:04.525 --> 00:00:09.397
So there are a number of key
considerations to think about in framing

2
00:00:09.397 --> 00:00:13.757
what FinTech means to an investor,
to a client, business or

3
00:00:13.757 --> 00:00:18.220
consumer oriented, or
to an employee, or an entrepreneur.

4
00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:24.570
The first is often offered as one of
the motivating purposes of FinTech.

5
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.490
That is to say, to capture the heart and

6
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.940
mind of the very important
demographic known as millennials.

7
00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:34.660
Now, apologies in advance because I
suspect some of you watching this lecture

8
00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.008
are indeed millennials.

9
00:00:36.008 --> 00:00:39.730
And we talk about you as though you're
not even in the room very often.

10
00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.683
But millennials stand a good chance
of inheriting in the US as much

11
00:00:44.683 --> 00:00:48.837
as $45 trillion of wealth
over the next 30 years.

12
00:00:48.837 --> 00:00:53.156
Millennials have lived through and
witnessed financial crisis, and

13
00:00:53.156 --> 00:00:56.742
give a kind of opportunity to
companies who target not just

14
00:00:56.742 --> 00:01:00.930
their current wealth but
the present value of their future wealth.

15
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.510
They have different views of the world.

16
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:09.127
They want to interact with
technology in a different way, and

17
00:01:09.127 --> 00:01:11.876
especially important for FinTech,

18
00:01:11.876 --> 00:01:16.766
they have varying levels of trust for
financial organizations.

19
00:01:16.766 --> 00:01:22.965
Which make a kind of push-pull
relationship with financial technology.

20
00:01:22.965 --> 00:01:28.620
In addition, issues of trust are bound
more generally across demographics when it

21
00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:34.291
comes to adoption of technology, when it
comes to belief and trust in algorithms.

22
00:01:34.291 --> 00:01:37.689
And what we know about them
has been rapidly expanding.

23
00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.540
Finally, choice architecture and in,
what we can know about consumers and

24
00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.760
customers is becoming ever more important.

25
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:55.640
It is now widely understood that how we
give clients and consumers, and investors.

26
00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.980
A series of choices for the selection
of products and services is critical.

27
00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:08.160
The number of choices, the characteristics
of choices, and in no other area

28
00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.160
than financial technology make this be
a determining characteristics of success.

29
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.090
And finally,
what we can know about customers,

30
00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:22.690
extracting from social media gives us
a view into what the future might be like.

31
00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.290
If we are ever going to see
a pure robo solution or

32
00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.170
we see enhanced bionic
versions of the robo model.
