00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:06.375
It's interesting to trace

2
00:00:06.375 --> 00:00:09.800
where the demand is coming from,

3
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.060
and of course, it's a bit
of a challenge to see

4
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:13.500
because we only see
the intersection

5
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.270
of supply and demand.

6
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:19.290
However, because
the supply of technology

7
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:23.575
is motivating and
enabling Fintech,

8
00:00:23.575 --> 00:00:26.325
the demand side
turns out to be key.

9
00:00:26.325 --> 00:00:29.549
Doing something new
enabled by technology,

10
00:00:29.549 --> 00:00:31.530
so that's a better experience.

11
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:33.345
It happens more accurately,

12
00:00:33.345 --> 00:00:35.250
it happens with greater scale,

13
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.340
it happens less expensively.

14
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.065
It opens new markets,

15
00:00:40.065 --> 00:00:42.840
including not just among

16
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.330
the wealthy in the United States,

17
00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:45.890
but all the way
down to the base of

18
00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.820
the pyramid in wealth
distribution around the world.

19
00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.270
Really, once again, brings us
back to what are attitudes.

20
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.310
So a lot of ways to
look at attitudes

21
00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.490
toward adoption of Fintech.

22
00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:02.014
A recent Federal Reserve
Board of Governors report

23
00:01:02.014 --> 00:01:05.420
on consumer and Mobile
Financial Services was telling.

24
00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.805
In the survey, something like,

25
00:01:07.805 --> 00:01:10.975
this is for US respondents,

26
00:01:10.975 --> 00:01:12.360
over the last 12 months,

27
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.680
65 percent of those surveyed
in the United States paid

28
00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.500
a bill using a mobile phone
or mobile phone web browser,

29
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.360
so an app on a mobile phone
or its web browser.

30
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.430
Over 40 percent purchased

31
00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.955
an actual physical item
using a browser,

32
00:01:28.955 --> 00:01:34.430
they paid for something in
a store using a mobile phone.

33
00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.550
They were involved
in remittances using

34
00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.450
Fintech companies like
Venmo or PayPal or so,

35
00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.105
or just commercial banking apps,

36
00:01:44.105 --> 00:01:46.970
25 percent of respondents did.

37
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.340
They paid for
transportation or made

38
00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.655
a donation between 12 and
20 percent, did those,

39
00:01:52.655 --> 00:01:54.950
or ultimately, used financial

40
00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.665
enabled transfer
across countries.

41
00:01:58.665 --> 00:02:01.460
Use of a mobile phone over

42
00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.819
just that recent
12-month period found

43
00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:06.620
that huge proportions of

44
00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.745
respondents felt
comfortable sending,

45
00:02:10.745 --> 00:02:16.880
or interacting, or allocating
money using their phones.

46
00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.919
As you'll see in just a bit,

47
00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:20.660
the adoption of these attitudes

48
00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.070
in the activities that are

49
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.560
involved has rapidly developed

50
00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.330
in just the last five years.
