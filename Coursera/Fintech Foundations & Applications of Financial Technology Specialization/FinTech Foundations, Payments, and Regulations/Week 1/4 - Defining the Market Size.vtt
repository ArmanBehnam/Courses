00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:07.305
Now defining the size
of the FinTech market

2
00:00:07.305 --> 00:00:09.000
presents the usual challenge of

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.445
defining sizes of
any kind of market.

4
00:00:11.445 --> 00:00:13.020
What defines size?

5
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.830
Assets under management,
flows of funds,

6
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.255
valuations of businesses
in a sector of sub sector.

7
00:00:20.255 --> 00:00:21.650
All of these would, of course, be

8
00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.930
legitimate ways of thinking
about size of the industry.

9
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.920
Numbers of players would also
be relevant for example.

10
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.280
So there are many estimates
of size varying also by

11
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.480
sector and sub sector which

12
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.345
technologies or channels
we're talking about.

13
00:00:35.345 --> 00:00:37.970
Are we thinking about revenues,

14
00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.370
are thinking about
sales and so on?

15
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.330
What is clear by
a number of measures

16
00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.770
and data sources here
from the KPMG Pulse of

17
00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.365
FinTech report published in 2019

18
00:00:51.365 --> 00:00:56.069
is that funding is
highly aggressive,

19
00:00:56.069 --> 00:01:02.415
ongoing, active, M&amp;A, mergers
and acquisitions that is,

20
00:01:02.415 --> 00:01:04.749
in the FinTech space abound

21
00:01:04.749 --> 00:01:07.490
and money is flowing
in from the roughly

22
00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.100
$2 trillion of overhang
in the venture and

23
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.825
private equity industries
into this space.

24
00:01:13.825 --> 00:01:16.550
As a subclass, payments

25
00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.890
and remittances
technologically enabled,

26
00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.540
which we call digital payments,

27
00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:26.060
was the largest component
of transaction volume in

28
00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.850
the FinTech subcategory with just

29
00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.645
under $4 trillion worldwide.

30
00:01:32.645 --> 00:01:36.005
As you can see from
the graph on the screen,

31
00:01:36.005 --> 00:01:39.440
total investment activity
going back to 2013

32
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.490
here expressed quarter by

33
00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.030
quarter has been
dramatically increasing.

34
00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.330
Although we have seen

35
00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.140
some volatility in
funding which, of course,

36
00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.660
is related to funding
in general but

37
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.840
also targeting the space in 2016,

38
00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.410
but generally overwhelmingly
season upward trend

39
00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.150
that's both in the capital

40
00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:00.830
invested read off
the left side of

41
00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.670
the graph or by deal count
on the far right.

42
00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.795
There has been in 2018 and 2019

43
00:02:07.795 --> 00:02:12.655
a slight decrease in the number
of deals in FinTech.

44
00:02:12.655 --> 00:02:15.080
However the general
trend seems to

45
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.990
have continued
although the space has

46
00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.350
gotten very filled as

47
00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.145
you must imagine
with FinTech deals.

48
00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:27.740
Remember the aggregate number
of companies while

49
00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.170
not being exactly the sum of

50
00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.780
all total investment
activity counted by

51
00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.955
numbers using the blue line
or the right axis.

52
00:02:37.955 --> 00:02:40.370
But the number of deals funded

53
00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.130
is and you can see it's on
the order of thousands.

54
00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.500
Thousands of deals funded

55
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.830
and FinTech globally around
a 112 billion last year.
