1
00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:07.035
Now, global FinTech funding has

2
00:00:07.035 --> 00:00:10.320
increased over
the last half decade,

3
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.150
albeit with some measure

4
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.970
of quarter by
quarter variability.

5
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:17.100
As hundreds and hundreds of

6
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.620
FinTech companies have
received those funds,

7
00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.030
underlying valuation
levels of some of

8
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:26.615
the best-known players
has increased a pace.

9
00:00:26.615 --> 00:00:28.730
A number of the ones we've

10
00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.560
talked about before
like Betterment and

11
00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.140
Wealthfront along with others
like Personal Capital in

12
00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.680
the Robo-Advisory space
have already gone

13
00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.594
through late stage
venture capital rounds

14
00:00:40.594 --> 00:00:42.890
going through series E and series

15
00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.500
F, with substantial valuations.

16
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.420
For example, Betterment closed

17
00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.270
around of about $70 million in

18
00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.215
mid 2017 with
the post-money valuation

19
00:00:54.215 --> 00:00:56.460
of approximately $800 million.

20
00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.710
It's an eye popping number.

21
00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.000
What makes it even more eye

22
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.890
popping is the amount
of assets on which

23
00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.420
those underlying fees were
presumably calculated.

24
00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.940
If you look at the graph
in front of you,

25
00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.730
you'll see that in
the summer of 2017,

26
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:12.620
Betterment might
have had something

27
00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.765
like $10 billion give or take.

28
00:01:14.765 --> 00:01:18.050
The valuation implied by
the flows from fees on

29
00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.260
$10 billion is really,

30
00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.300
really very, very rich by

31
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.580
normal valuation metrics even

32
00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.960
in technology related areas.

33
00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.595
In other words, the market
must be expecting,

34
00:01:32.595 --> 00:01:34.840
presuming efficiency
of the market,

35
00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.580
some rapid expansion of

36
00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.895
the market and of
sales for the firm.

37
00:01:40.895 --> 00:01:43.845
We see similar patterns
for Wealthfront,

38
00:01:43.845 --> 00:01:48.030
which reportedly did around
in 2014 at $700 million.

39
00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.460
Recently raising $75 million,

40
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.475
although the post-money valuation

41
00:01:52.475 --> 00:01:55.270
was as of this recording
unavailable.

42
00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.425
Personal Capital as well raised

43
00:01:57.425 --> 00:01:59.390
something like
$40 million recently,

44
00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.940
having previously
raised $75 million in

45
00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.005
2016 at a post-money valuation
of $500 million.

46
00:02:06.005 --> 00:02:08.420
At significantly lower levels of

47
00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.775
assets under management
once again under which

48
00:02:10.775 --> 00:02:12.950
fees are presumably calculated in

49
00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.960
cash flows derive fund from.

50
00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.480
To summarize, it looks

51
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.365
like the Robo-Advisory space
not only is expanding.

52
00:02:22.365 --> 00:02:26.745
It's hot and valuations
are following the money.

53
00:02:26.745 --> 00:02:29.530
So I mentioned just a moment
ago that many believe

54
00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.860
Vanguard is operating
the world's largest Robo

55
00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.475
at around a $150 to $120 billion

56
00:02:36.475 --> 00:02:38.785
in assets under management.

57
00:02:38.785 --> 00:02:41.770
It's interesting to
know that something

58
00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:45.920
like six months in
advance of that level,

59
00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.760
it reported being at
about $100 billion.

60
00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.140
If that's the case,

61
00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.540
then Vanguard must be
raising something like

62
00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.365
$5 billion a month in
its Robo practice.

63
00:02:56.365 --> 00:02:59.530
The top players as of
the second half of

64
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.165
2018 have been reported
to be Vanguard,

65
00:03:03.165 --> 00:03:06.465
followed by Schwab
Intelligent Portfolio Group

66
00:03:06.465 --> 00:03:09.870
at $27 billion followed
then by Betterment,

67
00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.420
which at that point
reported $13.5 billion,

68
00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.310
by Wealthfront over $10 billion,

69
00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.169
and then E-Trade, Wealthsimple,

70
00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:19.480
FutureAdvisor, Acorns,
Rebalance, and Fidelity.

71
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.310
What we see is a mix
of independence

72
00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.670
again like Betterment
and Wealthfront.

73
00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.660
Although again, we
mentioned that some Robos

74
00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:34.235
have arrangements with firms.

75
00:03:34.235 --> 00:03:36.870
For example, Fidelity
controls much of

76
00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.080
Betterment order flows
and earns referral fees.

77
00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.435
It's also well known that City

78
00:03:42.435 --> 00:03:47.665
owns some proportion
of Betterment.

79
00:03:47.665 --> 00:03:51.965
But we also see traditional
firms like Vanguard,

80
00:03:51.965 --> 00:03:55.340
by way of asset managers;
buy-side asset managers.

81
00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.390
We see traditional brokerage
firms like Schwab,

82
00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.370
a discount broker, coming in.

83
00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.610
We see some interesting
disruptors, like Acorns,

84
00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.445
which has a vast customer
pace as part of it.

85
00:04:09.445 --> 00:04:12.560
The largest
RoboAdvisors buy assets

86
00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.290
includes a broad cross-section of

87
00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.740
investment players
a cross section in

88
00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:23.125
diversity of which we see
reflected elsewhere in FinTech.

89
00:04:23.125 --> 00:04:25.890
A look at a broad
cross-section of

90
00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.170
RoboAdvisors reveals

91
00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:29.150
some pretty interesting
characteristics.

92
00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:30.775
For example, if you compare

93
00:04:30.775 --> 00:04:33.410
Acorns to Betterment
or FutureAdvisor or

94
00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.430
the Schwab Intelligent
Portfolio platform or

95
00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.570
T Rowe Price's active portfolios

96
00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.610
or Vanguard or
Wealthfront's offerings,

97
00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.950
you see a different approaches,
different numbers,

98
00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.684
and characters of
potential clients,

99
00:04:47.684 --> 00:04:49.140
and different assets
under management.

100
00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:52.650
Take for example, Acorns
versus Wealthfront.

101
00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.425
We've already talked
about Wealthfront.

102
00:04:54.425 --> 00:04:58.250
Acorns follows what's
called a roundup

103
00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:59.795
approach motivated by

104
00:04:59.795 --> 00:05:03.085
behavioral finance and
investor psychology,

105
00:05:03.085 --> 00:05:08.595
focusing on helping customers
round up their purchases.

106
00:05:08.595 --> 00:05:11.510
So for example, if you buy
a good or service using

107
00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:15.365
a linked debit card or
credit card for say $1.75,

108
00:05:15.365 --> 00:05:18.335
the service will round
up your purchase to $2,

109
00:05:18.335 --> 00:05:20.330
take the extra $0.25 and invest

110
00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.315
it in a Robo style portfolio.

111
00:05:23.315 --> 00:05:26.275
They reported, as
of December 2018,

112
00:05:26.275 --> 00:05:29.990
approximately $1.1 billion in

113
00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:33.595
assets across
over two million clients.

114
00:05:33.595 --> 00:05:39.645
By comparison, Wealthfront
reported over $11 billion,

115
00:05:39.645 --> 00:05:45.060
almost $11.5 billion, over
2,000 to 21,000 clients.

116
00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.240
Different approaches,
different numbers of clients.

117
00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.790
One taking a more

118
00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:53.790
traditional asset allocation
approach, Wealthfront,

119
00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:55.715
others using
behavioral finance like

120
00:05:55.715 --> 00:05:58.115
Acorns as a motivator,

121
00:05:58.115 --> 00:06:01.780
still very popular and

122
00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:06.340
still very interesting from
a FinTech perspective.
