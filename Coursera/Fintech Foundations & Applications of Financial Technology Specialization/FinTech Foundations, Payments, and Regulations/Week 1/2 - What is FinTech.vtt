00:00:04.414 --> 00:00:08.000
Just one quick word before we begin for
the absence of doubt.

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.470
We're not selling any products here,
any specific services.

3
00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:15.780
This is purely for
educational purposes in our course.

4
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.390
FinTech has evolved over the last
decade or so fairly rapidly.

5
00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.430
It has begun to significantly
influence business and

6
00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.190
business development in
the financial services industry.

7
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.860
There are a number of potential
definitions here, but

8
00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:38.180
one that is most useful I think
is that proposed by Morningstar.

9
00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.450
FinTech companies are those businesses
that leverage technology to create better

10
00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.440
and perhaps new financial services
both for consumers and businesses.

11
00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.950
Including companies of
all kinds operating and

12
00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:56.390
personal financial management,
insurances, payments, remittances,

13
00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.100
asset management, liability management,
retirement management and

14
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.270
a broad cross section of products and
services stemming from all of those.

15
00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:09.246
This would include of course,
is using questions of blockchain,

16
00:01:09.246 --> 00:01:13.293
applications of big data technology,
artificial intelligence,

17
00:01:13.293 --> 00:01:17.211
deep learning, thin learning,
natural language processing.

18
00:01:17.211 --> 00:01:22.568
Automated technology applied to
customer relationship management,

19
00:01:22.568 --> 00:01:27.120
robo-advising in a business
to investor setting, both for

20
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.880
defined benefit and
defined contribution investors.

21
00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.686
Automated and
technological enablement in the insurance

22
00:01:36.686 --> 00:01:40.315
industry including rapid underwriting and

23
00:01:40.315 --> 00:01:46.011
ongoing monitoring of properties and
lives, and human behaviors.

24
00:01:46.011 --> 00:01:49.378
Payments, cash management,
lending platforms and

25
00:01:49.378 --> 00:01:51.846
numerous other areas which of course,

26
00:01:51.846 --> 00:01:57.630
can expand to include really all areas
of the financial services industry.

27
00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.305
At the core, the main goals of
FinTech are reducing transactions and

28
00:02:02.305 --> 00:02:07.221
service costs, as well as reaching
market segments that are untapped or

29
00:02:07.221 --> 00:02:11.494
new, and which would otherwise
be potentially impractical,

30
00:02:11.494 --> 00:02:14.256
too costly, too uneconomic to engage.

31
00:02:14.256 --> 00:02:18.225
Creating or taking advantage
of economies of scale, and

32
00:02:18.225 --> 00:02:20.630
improving customer experience.

33
00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.817
Potentially allowing the possibility
of segmenting the marketplace,

34
00:02:24.817 --> 00:02:28.325
as we've already begun to see
in the robo-advisory space.
