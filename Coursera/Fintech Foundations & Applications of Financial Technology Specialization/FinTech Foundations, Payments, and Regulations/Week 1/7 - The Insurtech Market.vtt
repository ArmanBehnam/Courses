00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:06.850
Now, any treatment of FinTech
would be remiss if we

2
00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:09.580
didn't include areas
besides robos, although,

3
00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.340
of course, those are
often the kinds of

4
00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.850
FinTech players that
people pay attention to.

5
00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.460
One example is the growing
Insurtech market,

6
00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.780
a market where both for property,

7
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:23.220
casualty, life and health,

8
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.180
and other insurances, including

9
00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.315
financial product insurances
like variable annuities,

10
00:00:29.315 --> 00:00:33.355
we're seeing increased
deal flow coming in.

11
00:00:33.355 --> 00:00:35.650
For example, on the CB Insights

12
00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:37.630
quarterly Insurtech briefing from

13
00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.440
the last quarter of 2018
shows dramatic increases,

14
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.720
recently in both silos;
namely life and health,

15
00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.655
and property and casualty,

16
00:00:45.655 --> 00:00:50.075
having grown from
just five years ago.

17
00:00:50.075 --> 00:00:54.665
In other words, we see
about $1.6 billion

18
00:00:54.665 --> 00:00:56.600
having been funded in

19
00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.920
Insurtech in the fourth
quarter of 2018.

20
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.300
A recent peak, the most
recent before that was

21
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.240
just under two billion dollars

22
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.885
in the second quarter of 2015.

23
00:01:10.885 --> 00:01:16.205
Once again, we see
pro-cyclicality and we see

24
00:01:16.205 --> 00:01:19.615
correlation across
components like

25
00:01:19.615 --> 00:01:22.600
property and casualty,
and life and health.
