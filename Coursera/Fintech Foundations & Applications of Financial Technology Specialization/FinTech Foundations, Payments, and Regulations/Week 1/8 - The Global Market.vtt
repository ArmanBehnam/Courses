1
00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.320
Now, FinTech is clearly
a global phenomenon,

2
00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:13.515
and although much of the money
raised and deployed,

3
00:00:13.515 --> 00:00:14.820
and many of the customers are

4
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.319
basically in the United States,

5
00:00:16.319 --> 00:00:18.905
it will be completely
false to presume,

6
00:00:18.905 --> 00:00:22.249
that most FinTech activity
today or in the future,

7
00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:24.800
will be based in

8
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.090
the United States or involving
United States customers.

9
00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.670
A simple look at the top
10 FinTech deals in 2018,

10
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.820
reveals that only about
40 percent of the deals done,

11
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.025
the largest deals, were
based in the United States.

12
00:00:41.025 --> 00:00:45.980
The largest refinitiv, which
is a B2B platform which was

13
00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.970
bought out with a base level
of $17 billion,

14
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.085
was indeed based in the US.

15
00:00:53.085 --> 00:00:56.450
However, the Series C
funding round done by

16
00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.020
Ant Financial which
was at $14 billion,

17
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.960
saw a Chinese company
take in the cash.

18
00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.070
The third and fourth positions

19
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.260
were held by Wordpay and Nets,

20
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.050
at about 13 to 5.5 billion,

21
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.460
both in the UK and
Denmark respectively.

22
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.685
One in a purely M&A transaction.

23
00:01:20.685 --> 00:01:22.120
The other, once again,

24
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.410
in a buyout funding round.

25
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.685
So in other words, it's not
just a Venture Capital space,

26
00:01:28.685 --> 00:01:30.710
by the way of funding
it's a buyout space.

27
00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.365
It's not just Venture Capital,
it's Private Equity,

28
00:01:33.365 --> 00:01:36.685
and it's a global phenomenon,

29
00:01:36.685 --> 00:01:39.650
40 percent in the US, the rest

30
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.205
seeing activity around the world.

31
00:01:43.205 --> 00:01:45.830
Take China for example,

32
00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.685
a large and developing market
for FinTech even today.

33
00:01:49.685 --> 00:01:52.750
One of the top 5 deals
was specifically,

34
00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.280
in fact the second was
Ant Financial in 2018,

35
00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.820
and throughout the entire year,

36
00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.660
we saw about $18.2

37
00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.930
billion of additional funding
across Venture Capital,

38
00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.105
Private Equity, and M&A deals.

39
00:02:05.105 --> 00:02:06.650
This is once again
from the Pulse of

40
00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.295
FinTech report from
a partner KPMG.

41
00:02:10.295 --> 00:02:12.205
The pattern across time,

42
00:02:12.205 --> 00:02:14.800
both by deal count
and capital invested,

43
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.020
follows the pattern
we saw in the US.

44
00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.745
A general increase in

45
00:02:19.745 --> 00:02:23.269
activity money flowing
into the space,

46
00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:28.610
deal counts being
somewhat cyclical,

47
00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.440
having a recent downturn but

48
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.465
a general upward average trend,

49
00:02:35.465 --> 00:02:39.380
indicating ongoing
potential interest here,

50
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.540
once again, in China.

51
00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.870
The UK, although on

52
00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:51.325
an absolute basis larger
than we saw in China,

53
00:02:51.325 --> 00:02:53.990
at about $20.7 billion

54
00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.855
added up and in the aggregate
across the year,

55
00:02:56.855 --> 00:03:00.900
also had a weaker 2018

56
00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.105
than was seen over
the last several years.

57
00:03:05.105 --> 00:03:07.070
Again, a positive upward

58
00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.730
trend cyclicality in the funding,

59
00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.135
reflecting the global
phenomenon of FinTech.

60
00:03:15.135 --> 00:03:21.445
Europe, of course in the
aggregate larger than the UK,

61
00:03:21.445 --> 00:03:23.450
about at the level of

62
00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.480
the combination of
China and the UK,

63
00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.085
saw about $34.2 billion.

64
00:03:31.085 --> 00:03:35.320
Again, from the Pulse of
FinTech report from KPMG.

65
00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.610
Same trend in increase
in the number of deals,

66
00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.875
a bit of weakness in 2018,

67
00:03:40.875 --> 00:03:43.995
cyclicality in the flows

68
00:03:43.995 --> 00:03:48.300
reflecting varying
but positive demand.

69
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.465
Another important emerging area

70
00:03:51.465 --> 00:03:55.375
within the FinTech cluster
is real estate technology.

71
00:03:55.375 --> 00:03:58.885
The global market snapshot
of venture investments

72
00:03:58.885 --> 00:04:02.290
reveals very interesting patterns

73
00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.095
that correspond to what
we saw previously.

74
00:04:05.095 --> 00:04:07.480
Namely, some measure
of weakness in 2018,

75
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.315
but historically
increasing deal flow.

76
00:04:11.315 --> 00:04:14.970
NeueHouse, Juniper Square, Zesty,

77
00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.235
raised between 13
and $30 million.

78
00:04:18.235 --> 00:04:21.735
The median funding level
was three million dollars.

79
00:04:21.735 --> 00:04:23.430
That was in December,

80
00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.710
but the total funding
level of about a

81
00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.720
$108 million as of

82
00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.205
December of 2018 was
down dramatically,

83
00:04:33.205 --> 00:04:35.240
from what we saw previously.

84
00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.480
All that being said,

85
00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.260
the global real estate
tech market is strong.

86
00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.950
NeueHouse, Juniper Square,

87
00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.085
Zesty, WhyHotel, Dazhu Facility,

88
00:04:46.085 --> 00:04:47.630
Home Hero and so on,

89
00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:52.020
have multiple approaches,
are globally represented,

90
00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.610
not just in the United States

91
00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.330
but East Coast and West Coast,

92
00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:00.035
not just the United States
but China, Israel, India,

93
00:05:00.035 --> 00:05:04.865
and the UK, globally targeting
technology in real estate,

94
00:05:04.865 --> 00:05:10.680
B2B, B2C, and peer-to-peer.
