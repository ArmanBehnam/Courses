Hi, my name is Chris Geezy

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.935
from the Finance Department
at the Wharton School.

3
00:00:07.935 --> 00:00:09.930
I'm also Academic Director of

4
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:11.700
the Jacobs Levy Equity
Management Center

5
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.380
for Quantitative
Financial Research,

6
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.550
and the Academic Director of the

7
00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.530
Wharton Wealth
Management Initiative.

8
00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.500
In today's lectures,
we'll be looking at

9
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.025
the broad notion of
the FinTech market,

10
00:00:23.025 --> 00:00:25.695
its definition, its depth,

11
00:00:25.695 --> 00:00:27.320
its breadth, both across time,

12
00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.890
and in the cross-section of

13
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.830
countries in which we
see FinTech evolving.

14
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.200
We'll also look at
some of the specifics

15
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.225
driven by research

16
00:00:36.225 --> 00:00:41.715
into the potential audiences
of FinTech, users,

17
00:00:41.715 --> 00:00:45.920
adoption rates, as well
as some results from

18
00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.120
recent research on
algorithms that trust,

19
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.775
that goes behind adoption of

20
00:00:52.775 --> 00:00:55.550
algorithmic approaches as well
as some of the headwinds,

21
00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.140
and tailwinds to that adoption.
