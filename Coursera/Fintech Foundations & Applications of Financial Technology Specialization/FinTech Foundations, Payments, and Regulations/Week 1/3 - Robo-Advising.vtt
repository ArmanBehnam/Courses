1
00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:05.520
One of the more popular areas,

2
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.220
although perhaps not
the largest by way

3
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.190
of aggregate gross valuation,

4
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.260
is the area of robo-advisory.

5
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.060
Many will ultimately come to

6
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.865
know FinTech through
that channel.

7
00:00:17.865 --> 00:00:20.150
The definition of course
once again is fuzzy,

8
00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.065
but it originally meant

9
00:00:22.065 --> 00:00:23.970
financially advisory
businesses that

10
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.410
reduce costs of client service

11
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.230
by disintermediating humans.

12
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.260
Now, multiple models
have evolved over time,

13
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.940
including what we call
a bionic model that

14
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.600
incorporates both technology and

15
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.595
websites and enablement from

16
00:00:38.595 --> 00:00:40.920
the tech part of FinTech with,

17
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.220
or coupled with, or grouped
with human interactions.

18
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.320
But we do see
a very broad spectrum,

19
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.504
ranging from pure machine

20
00:00:49.504 --> 00:00:53.015
to just slightly enabled
bionic approaches.

21
00:00:53.015 --> 00:00:55.330
Today a loose definition is,

22
00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:56.900
a financial advisory firm,

23
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.630
a practice that uses
some kind of algorithm in

24
00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.945
some way to build
an allocation for customers,

25
00:01:02.945 --> 00:01:05.520
to build an investment
strategy approach.

26
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.960
These approaches usually
provide automated capture of

27
00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.030
client information
that would include

28
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.730
potentially know
your client elements,

29
00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:15.860
that are so important
in regulated space

30
00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.530
like financial advisory arenas.

31
00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.650
Financial goals,
liquidity preferences,

32
00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.930
risk capacity to risk tolerance,

33
00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.075
or risk aversion its inverse,

34
00:01:26.075 --> 00:01:29.975
recommended allocations of
individual investments,

35
00:01:29.975 --> 00:01:31.910
asset classes and so on.

36
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.240
Automated re-balancing,
tax loss harvesting

37
00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.020
and progress reporting on
the way to financial plans,

38
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.499
ultimately resulting
in some kind of output

39
00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:47.665
to investors or clients,
automated or otherwise.

40
00:01:47.665 --> 00:01:50.380
This polemic notion of

41
00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.420
a pure technologically

42
00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.475
enabled non-interactive
robo-advisor,

43
00:01:56.475 --> 00:01:59.905
really does not exist in
practice to my knowledge.

44
00:01:59.905 --> 00:02:02.470
I don't think at this point
there's anything that

45
00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.340
is purely a robo.

46
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.230
Two of the largest
independent robos,

47
00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:09.560
Wealthfront and Betterment,

48
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.620
both do have the ability

49
00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.840
for clients to get
in touch with them.

50
00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.900
They have client service
representatives and expanding

51
00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.385
business models that you might

52
00:02:18.385 --> 00:02:21.325
ultimately call bionic, although,

53
00:02:21.325 --> 00:02:23.830
they may wait them
significantly different

54
00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.785
from say a broker dealer or

55
00:02:26.785 --> 00:02:29.320
a financial advisory
firm that specifically

56
00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.830
blends the human and non-human.

57
00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.070
Sometimes we call it V

58
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.400
clinical and actuarial
approaches to advisory.

59
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.170
The pure vision of

60
00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.740
robo advisory has not yet
purely been achieved,

61
00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.750
in part because, it

62
00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.870
is so important for
humans to touch humans,

63
00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.205
and we'll have more to say
on that in just a moment.

64
00:02:49.205 --> 00:02:52.370
From the perspective
broadly from industry,

65
00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.670
the robo models also are very
important because it makes

66
00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.750
clients with potentially low
levels of investable assets,

67
00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.180
economically viable to service.

68
00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.040
This is a very interesting and

69
00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.840
important theme throughout much

70
00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.930
of financial technologically
enabled advisory,

71
00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.325
in part because of recent pushes

72
00:03:13.325 --> 00:03:15.950
toward a fiduciary standard

73
00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.600
in the investment advisory space,

74
00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.250
that would apply
to brokers as well

75
00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.830
as investment advisors alike.

76
00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:26.435
Inducing a kind of pressure
or impetus or motivation for

77
00:03:26.435 --> 00:03:28.790
certain players to segment

78
00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.970
their books as
the cost of advice,

79
00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.120
is expected to arise.

80
00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.405
Sorry, to increase.

81
00:03:36.405 --> 00:03:39.795
This notion of costs increasing,

82
00:03:39.795 --> 00:03:43.275
may, although it's yet
to be entirely settled,

83
00:03:43.275 --> 00:03:47.240
push higher cost per
dollar clients more toward

84
00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:50.440
technologically enabled
platforms where

85
00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.870
scale is possible as opposed
to taking them on in person.

86
00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.290
One example which has grown
dramatically recently,

87
00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.500
is the Vanguard personal
advisor services which was

88
00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.995
re-branded after being
around for a long time,

89
00:04:03.995 --> 00:04:07.585
a couple of years ago as a robo.

90
00:04:07.585 --> 00:04:09.300
By June of 2015,

91
00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.770
it had $21 billion of assets,

92
00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:13.880
as of the first
quarter of 2019 it

93
00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.835
had almost 116 billion.

94
00:04:16.835 --> 00:04:21.430
By all accounts, it's
the largest financial robo.

95
00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.255
Wealthfront, which is
another top 10 firm,

96
00:04:25.255 --> 00:04:27.440
has about $11 billion of

97
00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.005
assets as of the first
quarter of 2019.

98
00:04:30.005 --> 00:04:33.995
Betterment overtook
Wealthfront AUM back in 2015,

99
00:04:33.995 --> 00:04:35.240
and we'll discuss
that in a second,

100
00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.560
having about $16 billion as
of the same mark to market.

101
00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.990
90 percent of Wealthfront assets

102
00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.030
have been placed in
vanguard funds as

103
00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:46.145
part of the underlying strategy

104
00:04:46.145 --> 00:04:49.060
across asset
allocation categories.

105
00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.220
Betterment, in some sense,

106
00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:52.820
is viewed to have caught
up with Wealthfront

107
00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:54.470
by pivoting its business model to

108
00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.500
emphasize defined
contribution plan sales

109
00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:58.865
in smaller companies,

110
00:04:58.865 --> 00:05:01.190
which historically has not

111
00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.565
been the bailiwick
of Wealthfront.

112
00:05:03.565 --> 00:05:05.505
Over the last several years,

113
00:05:05.505 --> 00:05:07.520
certain large brokerages and

114
00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.340
asset managers have acquired,

115
00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.395
built or develop
robo-like offerings.

116
00:05:12.395 --> 00:05:15.425
Firms like Blackrock,
Schwab, Merrill.

117
00:05:15.425 --> 00:05:19.025
Fidelity controls much of
Betterment order flow,

118
00:05:19.025 --> 00:05:23.320
and of course, also earns
referral fees in doing so.
