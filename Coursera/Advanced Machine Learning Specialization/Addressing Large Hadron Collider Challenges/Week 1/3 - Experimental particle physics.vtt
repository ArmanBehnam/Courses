2
00:00:03.763 --> 00:00:08.557
One of the ways to develop theories
nowadays is to develop an experimental

3
00:00:08.557 --> 00:00:11.370
device that probes the universe.

4
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.230
The collected information might
give hints to theoreticians

5
00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.060
about the better version
of a current model.

6
00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.600
For example, how to include newly
absorbed phenomena into it and

7
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.520
improve the accuracy of model
predictions for further experiments.

8
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:34.810
CERN is a French abbreviation for
Center of European Nuclear Research.

9
00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.870
Essentially, it is a vast laboratory.

10
00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.871
There are several distinct
experiments that take place.

11
00:00:41.871 --> 00:00:46.327
And everyone is operated by
an international collaboration

12
00:00:46.327 --> 00:00:52.218
that unites physicists or
scientists from different countries.

13
00:00:52.218 --> 00:00:56.210
People from 100 different
countries work together

14
00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.349
despite political difficulties and
misunderstanding on governmental levels.

15
00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.380
They focused their intellectual
efforts on the development of

16
00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.990
better understanding of our universe
on the development of new technologies.

17
00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.520
So it is a fascinating place.

18
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.422
And there are, of course, some by-products
that you're most likely aware of.

19
00:01:19.422 --> 00:01:25.210
For example, CERN is the birth
place of the World Wide Web.

20
00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.382
So you are using this
to watch this lecture.

21
00:01:28.382 --> 00:01:35.681
Also, one of the great things built
there is called Large Hadron Collider.

22
00:01:35.681 --> 00:01:41.190
It has been used for discovery of Higgs
boson, and it is one of the finest and

23
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.050
the biggest data generation
machine ever created.

24
00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:52.012
By design, it is a machine for
smashing protons and examining outcomes.

25
00:01:52.012 --> 00:01:56.885
By effect, it is a massive arena for
examining different

26
00:01:56.885 --> 00:02:01.870
models striving for
better explanation of the universe.

27
00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:06.171
Let us take a closer look at LHC.

28
00:02:06.171 --> 00:02:12.124
It is a 27 km-long tunnel,
50 to 175 meters deep, and

29
00:02:12.124 --> 00:02:20.870
the protons are accelerated to the speed
almost comparable to the speed of light.

30
00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:27.133
And the energy collision on those
protons is up to 14 teraelectronvolts.

31
00:02:27.133 --> 00:02:34.082
There are four big detectors
located around the ring.

32
00:02:34.082 --> 00:02:38.981
Those are called ALICE,
ATLAS, CMS and LHCb.

33
00:02:38.981 --> 00:02:46.120
So there are 40 million bunches of
proton that collide every second.

34
00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:53.140
Every detector generates enormous
amounts of data, for example,

35
00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:59.100
since the beginning, hundred of petabytes
has been stored for later data analysis.

36
00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:04.860
Let's take a look at the cycle that
starts from the very beginning

37
00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.580
till the discovery or
publication has been created.

38
00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:16.610
So we start with creation of
protons out of hydrogen atoms,

39
00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:22.620
and then we accelerate those to the speed
almost equal to the speed of light.

40
00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.561
Then those protons
are grouped into bunches.

41
00:03:27.561 --> 00:03:31.743
And those bunches
are smashed into each other.

42
00:03:31.743 --> 00:03:36.674
And during this collision,
set of particles appear out of

43
00:03:36.674 --> 00:03:41.810
the energy of this collision,
and those are called events.

44
00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:50.316
Then the detector that sits around place
of this collision records information

45
00:03:50.316 --> 00:03:56.861
of the energy that is deposited by
every particle flying out of the event.

46
00:03:56.861 --> 00:04:01.415
And can convert this information
of the energy into the hits

47
00:04:01.415 --> 00:04:03.742
that you can record and store.

48
00:04:05.841 --> 00:04:11.916
Left after after this, the algorithm
that tries to reconstruct trajectories

49
00:04:11.916 --> 00:04:18.280
of different particles, and identify
types of those particles comes to action.

50
00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:23.900
After we get the picture
of individual trajectories,

51
00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:31.490
we combine them into vertices and
form a structural of the whole event.

52
00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:36.997
Then we build the map of the event and
filter for the further analysis

53
00:04:36.997 --> 00:04:42.320
only those that have some meaning
from the physical point of view.

54
00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.420
And only after this,

55
00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:51.672
we analyze statistical properties of
those events that has been stored and

56
00:04:51.672 --> 00:04:57.400
make conclusion about validity of models

57
00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:03.399
that predict existence of certain
events of certain part of the events.

58
00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:13.020
Let's take a closer look at the stages
that happen during the data collection.

59
00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:17.790
So here, you see a schematic image of

60
00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:22.770
the detector and two bunches of
protons flying to each other.

61
00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:29.667
There is actually a movie that you can
look, if you follow the link below,

62
00:05:29.667 --> 00:05:33.160
that describes this
process a little bit nicer.

63
00:05:34.762 --> 00:05:39.072
So at the place of collision
there is a detector which is

64
00:05:39.072 --> 00:05:42.650
essentially a sub-atomic digital camera.

65
00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:44.190
Sits and

66
00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:49.248
in records outcome of the collision
that happens during the data taking.

67
00:05:49.248 --> 00:05:52.328
On the upper part of this image,

68
00:05:52.328 --> 00:05:57.243
you see the mechanical
design of LHCb detector.

69
00:05:57.243 --> 00:06:01.845
And at the bottom part of this image,
you will see reconstructed trajectories of

70
00:06:01.845 --> 00:06:05.510
elementary particles that have
been detected by this detector.

71
00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:12.920
So at the right part of the bottom image,
you see

72
00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:20.756
schematic grids that represent
sensitive part of the detector,

73
00:06:20.756 --> 00:06:24.280
and there are colorful lines

74
00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:29.620
that have been reconstructed from the data,
collected from those grids.

75
00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:35.011
So here is a closeup look at
those part of the detector.

76
00:06:35.011 --> 00:06:40.164
You see green and
blue rectangles that represent hits

77
00:06:40.164 --> 00:06:46.446
of the particles that have been
recorded by the sensitive element.

78
00:06:46.446 --> 00:06:51.194
And those hits actually
produced by particles, and

79
00:06:51.194 --> 00:06:57.852
we can reconstruct parameters of
trajectories that created those hits.

80
00:06:57.852 --> 00:07:01.860
So the colorful lines
are exactly those lines.

81
00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:08.620
So here you see their
collection of lines that

82
00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:14.510
has been reconstructed for
the whole event.

83
00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:20.620
And the data is used for this analysis,
for this reconstruction, come from

84
00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:26.020
various parts of the directories,
not only the backside or downstream side.

85
00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:30.672
It also comes from, there is a middle
part that is called tracker.

86
00:07:30.672 --> 00:07:35.660
And there is a very precise
part of the detector that

87
00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:40.000
sits around the place of the collision.

88
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.932
It is called vertex locator.

89
00:07:41.932 --> 00:07:50.304
That gives most of the information
about the particle trajectory.

90
00:07:50.304 --> 00:07:56.720
And then we have to identify what kind
of particle every track represents.

91
00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:00.782
We can use various sources of information.

92
00:08:00.782 --> 00:08:05.957
The first one is that every
particle leaves different

93
00:08:05.957 --> 00:08:11.251
traces in different
subdetectors of the experiment.

94
00:08:11.251 --> 00:08:15.889
For example, Electrons leave

95
00:08:15.889 --> 00:08:20.690
tracks at tracking system and
electromagnetic calorimeter.

96
00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:24.680
Photons leave no traces
in tracking system but

97
00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:28.678
leave traces electromagnetic calorimeter.

98
00:08:28.678 --> 00:08:33.919
Hard ones such as protons, Kaons, and
pions, leave tracks in inner most

99
00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:40.570
tracking system and electromagnetic
calorimeter and hadronic calorimeter.

100
00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:45.162
And there is a special kind of
particles that are called muons, they're

101
00:08:45.162 --> 00:08:51.090
heavier brothers of electrons that
fly through the whole detector and

102
00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:52.899
leave traces everywhere.

103
00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:59.810
So collection of the information
that those sub-detectors provide

104
00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:05.880
allows us to deduce
the type of the particle.

105
00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:09.460
And this actually is one of
the machine learning problems

106
00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:13.370
that is being solved at every experiment.

107
00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:17.060
After you got the picture
of individual tracks,

108
00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:21.120
it is important to
reconstruct the whole image,

109
00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:26.410
the whole event that
consists of tracks and

110
00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:32.820
vertices that happen during
the particle decays.

111
00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:37.780
So on the slide,
you see just the same collision that

112
00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:42.982
we looked from the perspective
of the vortex locator.

113
00:09:42.982 --> 00:09:45.380
So it is the exactly
the same trajectories.

114
00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:50.324
And if you look closer,
you will see that there are so-called

115
00:09:50.324 --> 00:09:55.175
secondary vertices that correspond
to a very short flight of

116
00:09:55.175 --> 00:09:59.470
a particle that is then
decayed into something else.

117
00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:05.018
After this trajectory's
particle identification and

118
00:10:05.018 --> 00:10:09.385
vertex identification has been happened,

119
00:10:09.385 --> 00:10:15.521
we still have to understand whether or
not inside this event,

120
00:10:15.521 --> 00:10:21.320
something interesting
has actually happened.

121
00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:23.640
And for this purpose,

122
00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:28.700
we have special selection procedures
that are called triggers.

123
00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:30.300
There are two stages of triggers.

124
00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:35.070
The first one is hardware trigger
that reduces the rate of the event

125
00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:39.900
from 40 MHz to 1 MHz.

126
00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:44.935
And there is a software trigger that
reduces this rate even further,

127
00:10:44.935 --> 00:10:50.380
and output of this
trigger is being use for

128
00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:53.230
offline analysis and
eventually for discovery.

129
00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:59.027
Design of the triggers is actually
a quite interesting problem from machine

130
00:10:59.027 --> 00:11:00.592
learning perspective.

131
00:11:00.592 --> 00:11:05.764
My group has been taking part and
design of the triggers for

132
00:11:05.764 --> 00:11:11.490
LHCb experiment, and
it works in data taking since 2015.

133
00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:16.790
More detailed animation about
the design of CERN and how it works,

134
00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:21.910
design of LHC and how it works,
you can find if you follow this link

135
00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:26.160
and you see the movie produced by CERN.

136
00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:33.010
And at this slide, I've collected
examples of machine learning challenges

137
00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:38.530
that are related to the topics
that I've briefly scratched.

138
00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:43.977
So precise and fast particle tracking,
single tracks,

139
00:11:43.977 --> 00:11:49.883
showers and jets kind of objects
that detector operate with.

140
00:11:49.883 --> 00:11:51.356
Particle identification,

141
00:11:51.356 --> 00:11:55.180
how can you discriminate between
different kinds of particles?

142
00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:59.700
Fast and accurate online data
processing and filtering.

143
00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:04.072
How you make sure that data
collected can be trusted.

144
00:12:04.072 --> 00:12:08.609
If there is anomaly happening
during the data taking,

145
00:12:08.609 --> 00:12:13.748
you should disregard the model
data taken during the period.

146
00:12:15.262 --> 00:12:20.220
You should take certain measures
to fix the infrastructure to

147
00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:22.613
improve quality of the data.

148
00:12:22.613 --> 00:12:27.527
And, of course, there are very
interesting topic of design optimization

149
00:12:27.527 --> 00:12:32.519
of the detector, where various techniques
like Bayesian optimization and

150
00:12:32.519 --> 00:12:35.280
surrogate modelling can be used.

151
00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:42.370
And here's example of a tracking problem
that we'll cover during the next lecture.

152
00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:47.277
Given the set of hits
represented by points here,

153
00:12:47.277 --> 00:12:51.841
you should be able to
reconstruct the tracks and

154
00:12:51.841 --> 00:12:58.016
estimate parameters of those
tracks as precisely as possible.

155
00:12:58.016 --> 00:13:04.227
