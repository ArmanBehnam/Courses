2
00:00:04.228 --> 00:00:09.221
Let's take a look at the central
physics case measurement of specific

3
00:00:09.221 --> 00:00:14.030
characteristics of our role
on the subatomic level.

4
00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.825
If you remember, we spoke previously about

5
00:00:17.825 --> 00:00:23.920
the very big difference between
the magnitude of gravity and other forces.

6
00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:29.300
So there are different hypotheses that
tried to explain this phenomenon.

7
00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:36.260
For example, large extra dimension models,
graviton, and micro black-holes.

8
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.810
And one of the hypothesis says
that there are extra dimensions

9
00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:46.350
that exist in our world that we don't
notice because they are very tiny.

10
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.020
Look at the illustration on the left.

11
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.625
So there is a lady walking on the wire,
and for her,

12
00:00:53.625 --> 00:00:58.876
since she is a large entity
compared to the wire diameter,

13
00:00:58.876 --> 00:01:03.830
it's essentially a one dimensional object.

14
00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:09.500
But for a flea that sits on this wire,
there is actually additional dimension,

15
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.350
and she can consider the wire
as a two-dimensional object.

16
00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.092
You can follow the link and
see a nice cartoon by

17
00:01:19.092 --> 00:01:25.660
Daniel Whiteson about explanation,
what are those extra dimensions?

18
00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:33.410
And the way how you can prove the theory
works or not is to make an experiment.

19
00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.190
In the case of the Large Hadron Collider,

20
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.066
you design an experiment or
look for a specific decay or

21
00:01:43.066 --> 00:01:47.930
a specific kind of event
that you can measure.

22
00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.340
And in some cases,

23
00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.130
events might happen with higher
probability than in other cases.

24
00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.840
And some theories might explain
those differences in probabilities.

25
00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.660
We will talk about this in more
details at the third lecture but,

26
00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.950
for the moment,
let's consider we need to measure

27
00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.340
a specific quantity related to events
happening at the Large Hadron Collider.

28
00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:26.176
And the measuring is a key for
theory discrimination.

29
00:02:26.176 --> 00:02:30.624
Actually, there are plenty of
theories has been studied already,

30
00:02:30.624 --> 00:02:33.130
has been tested already at Collider.

31
00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:39.680
And on this slide, you see examples of
various models that people have probed on

32
00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:45.500
ATLAS experiment, or
those are called ATLAS Exotics Searches.

33
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:51.270
And it shows how well or how bad

34
00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:58.140
the limit or estimation of the model
compares to the standard model.

35
00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.030
And you see that all the measurements
are pretty much aligned with

36
00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.490
standard model predictions.

37
00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:10.900
So let's look at the example
of Higgs boson discovery.

38
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:17.200
And in this case,
it is a decay of Higgs boson into two photons.

39
00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:23.210
So you see how the theoretical
picture of those event looks like,

40
00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:27.590
so it is displayed on the top
right part of the slide.

41
00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.780
It is so-called Feynman diagram
that shows the process in theory.

42
00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:39.900
At the same time, there is a diagram or
a histogram that shows the dependency

43
00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:46.470
of the number of events with
respect to the mass of the event.

44
00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:51.120
And you see that there was
a special bump that is

45
00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.243
highlighted in the middle of
the histogram that shows the excess of

46
00:03:56.243 --> 00:04:02.718
the experimental data that has been
measured at the experiment Atlas.

47
00:04:02.718 --> 00:04:07.900
With respect to the data that we
expected to see on the assumption

48
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:13.250
that there is no such thing as decay
of Higgs boson into gamma quants.

49
00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.340
Let's make a short detour
into the Feynman diagram,

50
00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.820
because it is a really
powerful instrument for

51
00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.900
displaying the processes that
happen on subatomic level.

52
00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.917
So at this particular diagram,

53
00:04:28.917 --> 00:04:33.843
you see a muon that transforms
into something else.

54
00:04:33.843 --> 00:04:40.654
So at the same time,
at this diagram you see a time scale and

55
00:04:40.654 --> 00:04:44.826
a coordinate depicted by letter S.

56
00:04:44.826 --> 00:04:52.000
We start with a muon and
the time goes on the horizontal axis.

57
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:59.700
And then it turns into something else,
like a muon neutrino and W boson.

58
00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:07.220
And then in turn, this W boson turns into
an electron and anti-electron neutrino.

59
00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.000
Let's look at the steps.

60
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.961
So those Feynman diagrams
consist of lines that

61
00:05:14.961 --> 00:05:19.020
represent particles and

62
00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.729
by dots that represent interaction points.

63
00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:30.010
Those are points in the diagram
that reach momentum charge and

64
00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:33.060
energy conservation must be valid.

65
00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:40.732
At the second vertex, we see creation
of particles out of W boson.

66
00:05:40.732 --> 00:05:47.608
And this creation of particle
also conserves mass and

67
00:05:47.608 --> 00:05:51.900
charge and energy of particles.

68
00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:54.435
So in short,

69
00:05:54.435 --> 00:06:00.526
Feynman diagram represent a quantum
process that unfolds in space and time.

70
00:06:00.526 --> 00:06:05.970
And consists two basic elements,
which are straight lines of particles and

71
00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:10.050
forces that are represented by wavy lines.

72
00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:16.240
Vertices represent interaction point
which conserve energy and momentum.

73
00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.550
And those diagrams allow for

74
00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:25.430
calculation of the probability of the
processes that happens according to those.

75
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:30.630
And in the following slides,
we'll try to examine

76
00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:34.730
their appearance of so-called Z boson.

77
00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:39.210
It mediates weak interaction,
along with W boson.

78
00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:45.050
And these kind of boson,
the boson can decay into various nodes,

79
00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:49.406
or channels, as they're called
by physicists, which are lepton,

80
00:06:49.406 --> 00:06:55.260
anti-lepton pair, neutrino, anti-neutrino
pair, or quark or anti-quark pair.

81
00:06:55.260 --> 00:07:00.910
Roughly, the ratio of those molds
are presented in the slide.

82
00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:05.851
But more exact values of
those ratios is specified at

83
00:07:05.851 --> 00:07:11.210
so-called particle data
group database that contains

84
00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:16.700
information about all possible
decays that has been recorded so

85
00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:22.005
far by all particle experiments.

86
00:07:22.005 --> 00:07:28.130
So discovery of that boson
has happened in 1983 at CERN,

87
00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:33.415
and it is very important part
of standard model jigsaw puzzle.

88
00:07:34.825 --> 00:07:43.140
So let's take a look at the process
that creates this kind of boson.

89
00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:48.570
So here is a more complicated Feynman
diagram on the top left of the slide.

90
00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:53.850
So we start from the protons
that collide with each other,

91
00:07:54.880 --> 00:08:00.460
and you see that every proton,
it consists of three quarks.

92
00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:03.650
So it is up, up and down quarks.

93
00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:06.520
And out of those three quarks,

94
00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:12.080
one becomes engaged with the other
quark coming from other proton.

95
00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:15.940
So it is schematically represented
at the center of the slide.

96
00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:21.234
So those two down quarks
interact with each other and

97
00:08:21.234 --> 00:08:25.564
turn either into a gamma quark or
a Z boson,

98
00:08:25.564 --> 00:08:31.600
which eventually decays into a muon,
an anti-muon pair.

99
00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:37.102
So another representation
of the process is a more

100
00:08:37.102 --> 00:08:43.390
simplistic one you can see on
the top right of the screen,

101
00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:50.731
so just basically a Z boson
decaying into muon, anti-muon pair.

102
00:08:50.731 --> 00:08:52.291
And since we have a particle that
decays into a muon, anti-muon pair,

103
00:08:52.291 --> 00:08:53.500
such processes is called resonance.

104
00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:57.309
And its probability can be
estimated from the diagram

105
00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:01.220
according to the formula
that is depicted here.

106
00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:04.640
You can find more details via the link.

107
00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:09.890
But the most important
part is the probability of

108
00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:15.350
decay of this kind, Z boson decaying
into a neuron, anti-neuron pair,

109
00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:21.170
is the highest at the so-called
invariant mass of two mu's

110
00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:27.530
equal to mass of the Z boson that
has been used to create those.

111
00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:31.500
So displaying this
probability distribution

112
00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:39.950
according to mass access,
we see something like the Gaussian,

113
00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:44.180
as it's displayed on the right
part of this picture.

114
00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:49.710
And the alternative mode of
those two muons appearing

115
00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:57.400
out of the two down quarks
direction is through gamma quant.

116
00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:01.660
And since gamma quant doesn't
have any specific mass,

117
00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:10.330
there is no specific peak at any
specific region of the mass scale.

118
00:10:11.335 --> 00:10:17.850
So the probability distribution of finding

119
00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:25.050
two muons coming from a gamma quant is
depicted on the histogram on the slide.

120
00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:28.760
And you see the shape of this histogram

121
00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:32.930
is quite different from
the one we saw before.

122
00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:38.130
So in reality, we see a mixture
of two processes together.

123
00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:42.797
So we see something that
is a combination of

124
00:10:42.797 --> 00:10:49.380
a Gaussian-like shape and
exponential-like shape.

125
00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:52.000
And somehow we can extract

126
00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.560
information about the Gaussian
from the mixture of the model.

127
00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:04.201
And the most interesting part,
the most interesting parameter

128
00:11:04.201 --> 00:11:09.314
that we can extract is actually
mass of the set that boson.

129
00:11:09.314 --> 00:11:14.591
And we can do so, for example,
by feeding a Gaussian and

130
00:11:14.591 --> 00:11:21.800
some exponential shape into the histogram
that we got from the experiment.

131
00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:28.600
So here you see the dimuon mass spectrum.

132
00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:37.290
It is a histogram that shows number
of events that have specific mass.

133
00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:42.520
And the range of the mass
scales from very small

134
00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:47.740
value to very high, thousand of GeV.

135
00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:57.422
And you see there are several peaks that
sits on the shape of the background.

136
00:11:57.422 --> 00:12:02.398
Every peak correspond to a specific
particle that has been discovered

137
00:12:02.398 --> 00:12:04.260
at certain point of time.

138
00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:09.769
And we will focus in the home
task at the finding parameters,

139
00:12:09.769 --> 00:12:12.262
or finding mass of Z boson.

140
00:12:12.262 --> 00:12:19.993
