00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:05.161
[SOUND] Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:05.161 --> 00:00:09.088
My name is Andrey, and in this course,
with my colleague, Mikhail,

3
00:00:09.088 --> 00:00:12.470
we're going to introduce
you to Particle Physics.

4
00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:14.300
If you start worrying already,

5
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:19.210
what does particle physics have in common
with machine learning, don't panic much.

6
00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:25.100
The topic we have selected will be very
well-related to machine learning and

7
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.670
data science.

8
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.640
I'm team leader of Yandex School of
Data Analysis at LHCb experiment.

9
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.300
Along with scientists from other
universities across the globe,

10
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.610
we are working on particle
physics problems.

11
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.460
Our group focuses on applying machine
learning to those problems and

12
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:51.920
topics of this course that are pretty
much grounded on our experience.

13
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.340
We are especially fascinated by
the fact that such research field

14
00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:03.510
as particle physics, hunting for answers
to profound mysteries of our Universe,

15
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.950
heavily depends upon machine
learning techniques nowadays.

16
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.130
There are also clues that such
connection goes a bit deeper and

17
00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.730
you can draw parallels to other
scientific domains as well, so

18
00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.990
the course is structured
in the following way.

19
00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.330
At the first part, I will give a mild
introduction into particle physics and

20
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.190
we'll explain basic notions so
you will understand the structure and

21
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.430
the main terms that physicists
use to describe the forces and

22
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.475
particles that comprise
the fundamental level of our Universe.

23
00:01:42.475 --> 00:01:46.775
At the second lecture,
we will explain some of the details,

24
00:01:46.775 --> 00:01:49.985
how particle detectors are designed and

25
00:01:49.985 --> 00:01:55.655
what mechanism can be used to detect
different kinds of tiny particles.

26
00:01:55.655 --> 00:02:00.823
At the third lecture,
we will explain how new physics search

27
00:02:00.823 --> 00:02:05.396
can be mediated through a search for
rare process.

28
00:02:05.396 --> 00:02:10.341
Then, we'll show some examples
of dark matter search

29
00:02:10.341 --> 00:02:13.359
at proposed experiment at CERN.

30
00:02:13.359 --> 00:02:19.362
And at the final, the fifth lecture, we
will show how machine learning techniques

31
00:02:19.362 --> 00:02:25.040
can be applied to design of the new
experiment or upgrade existing detector.

32
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.720
So all of those five lectures will be
a mixture of the main knowledge and

33
00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.160
machine learning.

34
00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.150
Hopefully, the curriculum will help
you to appreciate how specific

35
00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.450
techniques of machine learning can
be used to help improving precision,

36
00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:51.100
accuracy, and speed of data processing
that happens at fundamental physics.

37
00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.410
So why are we focusing
on particle physics?

38
00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:01.033
First of all, it faces the most
fundamental problem of our Universe and

39
00:03:01.033 --> 00:03:06.939
understanding of those problems will
explain the mechanism of our world,

40
00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:12.679
so we can appreciate better where we
are and how the place is structured.

41
00:03:12.679 --> 00:03:18.682
Ultimately, this knowledge can enable
people to improve our level of existence

42
00:03:18.682 --> 00:03:24.520
by transferring the knowledge into
technologies that we use on a daily basis.

43
00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.545
There are plenty of puzzles
that are still unsolved and

44
00:03:28.545 --> 00:03:32.640
advanced machine learning
can be applied there.

45
00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:38.520
Such exercise does not necessarily
require domain knowledge,

46
00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:44.930
so we hope you will find the theoretical
part not very demanding and

47
00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.970
practical part of our course,
engaging and rewarding.

48
00:03:50.988 --> 00:03:56.690
True disclaimer,
that we are not particle physicists, and

49
00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:03.720
particle physics is a subject essentially
much more complex than described here.

50
00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.220
We do not guarantee completeness,
accuracy, or

51
00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:12.140
applicability of information therein
to your particle physics adventure.

52
00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.860
The sole reason for
these simplifications is to allow for

53
00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:21.200
a more prominent universe picture
to emerge that will help you

54
00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:26.300
to get engaged in the beautiful
journey of our Universe exploration.

55
00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:32.100
Let's start with variety of scales
you can encounter in there.

56
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:38.570
As you can imagine, there is a fundamental
level at which particle physics works.

57
00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:44.050
There are quarks or
tiny bits of matter that stick together

58
00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:49.580
to form a more significant object
like a proton or a neutron.

59
00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:55.640
As those attach to each other and
atomic nucleus is formed,

60
00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:00.420
then goes a whole atom that
turns into a molecule, and

61
00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:04.070
then to a regular method that
we used to interact with.

62
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:09.470
Going further, we get into a celestial
kingdom, we encounter astronomic

63
00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:14.554
object like planets, stars,
nebulae, and galaxies.

64
00:05:14.554 --> 00:05:18.079
The observable Universe today is enormous.

65
00:05:18.079 --> 00:05:25.238
It is still a spherical thing with the
radius about 50 billion light years long,

66
00:05:25.238 --> 00:05:31.270
or about 5 to 1026-meter long
if you prefer the metric system.

67
00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:37.349
You may wonder why the scale is so
different for

68
00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:43.240
different object and
what is the reason for such a difference.

69
00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:47.346
So one of the the answers
to this question is

70
00:05:47.346 --> 00:05:52.800
the different forces
mediate different objects.

71
00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.540
On this slide,
we show which forces are responsible for

72
00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:00.670
the creation of different
kinds of objects.

73
00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:04.119
It starts with so-called strong force.

74
00:06:04.119 --> 00:06:10.073
It is responsible for dealing with
subatomic objects like baryons,

75
00:06:10.073 --> 00:06:14.720
like protons and neutrons,
or atomic nucleus.

76
00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.590
Then, there is electro-weak force,

77
00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:20.860
that is a mixture of electromagnetic and
weak ones.

78
00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:22.370
It deals with a higher scale,

79
00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:27.590
ranging from atom to matter,
and then there is a gravity.

80
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:33.920
Of course, that is responsible for
creation of much larger objects

81
00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:40.020
that we know from looking at
the sky through the telescopes.

82
00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:43.120
Those are ranging from
asteroids to galaxies.

83
00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:46.640
You can see the magnitude of those
forces differ significantly.

84
00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:50.910
The strong force is the way
stronger than the gravity.

85
00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:55.490
There are 41 orders of magnitude
difference between those two.

86
00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:00.830
These difference make physicists
head spin quite a bit.

87
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:05.930
We will touch this as
a question in a second,

88
00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:13.380
after introduction of the standard
model of elementary particles.

89
00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:21.670
The standard model describes what Universe
is made of and how it holds together.

90
00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:25.810
It is addressed on two central ideas.

91
00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:29.720
The first one,
all matter is made of particles.

92
00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:34.530
And the second one, that these
particles interact with each other

93
00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:40.540
by exchanging other particles
associated with the fundamental forces.

94
00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:45.200
The essential grains of matter,
fermions, and

95
00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:52.018
the force carriers are bosons, the names
of those two classes refer to their spins.

96
00:07:52.018 --> 00:07:55.622
Fermions have integer values of spin,

97
00:07:55.622 --> 00:08:01.199
whereas bosons have integer values,
I show it on the slide.

98
00:08:01.199 --> 00:08:06.280
Fermions come in two families,
the lepton family has six members.

99
00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:10.230
With electron being
the best known of them,

100
00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:14.760
the quarks family contains six quarks,
the up and

101
00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:19.660
down quarks are found inside protons and
neutrons.

102
00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:24.730
The 12 fermions are the building
blocks of matter.

103
00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:29.080
These particles interact with each
other through fundamental forces.

104
00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:36.200
These, each force comes with one or
more force carriers, strong force,

105
00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:41.400
mediate through gluons and binds
the quarks within protons and neutrons.

106
00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:46.050
The photon is associated with
electromagnetic interaction.

107
00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:49.640
The weak interaction is responsible for
radioactivity.

108
00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:53.279
It comes with Z and W bosons.

109
00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:57.350
Combining elementary particles, allows for

110
00:08:57.350 --> 00:09:01.300
creation of more complicated
forms of matter.

111
00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:07.400
There are rules how quarks can be
connected in more complicated particles,

112
00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:08.100
hadrons.

113
00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:12.800
It is where the Large Hadron Collider
takes its name.

114
00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:16.500
The three quarks combine,
may form a baryon.

115
00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:23.390
For example, proton or neutron, even
number of quarks, like 2 or 4, form a meson.

116
00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:29.156
Until the beginning of this century,
it was thought that

117
00:09:29.156 --> 00:09:34.265
mesons come only in the form of quark and
antiquark pairs, but

118
00:09:34.265 --> 00:09:39.671
in 2007, Belle Collaboration
has discovered tetraquark,

119
00:09:39.671 --> 00:09:44.710
that has been confirmed by
LHCb collaboration in 2014.

120
00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:52.080
The standard model is both
remarkably simple and very powerful.

121
00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:55.380
Complex equations are expressed,

122
00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:59.780
expressing all possible particle
interactions mathematically.

123
00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:04.868
These equation allow theories
to make exact predictions

124
00:10:04.868 --> 00:10:09.320
in nearly every quantity
that has been measured in

125
00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:14.410
particle physics laboratories
over past five decades.

126
00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:20.849
A false right on the predicted value
within experimental error margins.

127
00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:27.960
At this slide, you see a snapshot of
a lowly animation that grasps the spirit

128
00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:31.810
of the standard model by a bunch
of Lego building blocks.

129
00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:35.380
If you have a couple of spare minutes,
I highly recommend having a look at it.

130
00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:39.395
So what are the standard
model shortcomings?

131
00:10:41.788 --> 00:10:47.850
There are things that it does not
explain well or doesn't explain at all.

132
00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:52.480
For example, gravity is not included
in this standard model at all.

133
00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:57.699
And the question, why is gravity so
much weaker than everything else?

134
00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:04.330
The second question is, why masses
of particle differ so massively?

135
00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:09.030
Standard model misses great
deal of the Universe.

136
00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:13.990
It is known that there are five
times more dark matter

137
00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:19.710
that sits in the galaxies around us, and

138
00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:23.930
standard model have no clue what
kind of particle it consists of.

139
00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:30.480
Also, the standard model does not explain

140
00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:36.180
that asymmetry of flows for
matter and antimatter well enough.

141
00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:40.660
We know that there
are a vast amount of matter

142
00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:45.660
existing in the Universe around us,
and almost no sign of antimatter.

143
00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:51.241
So this asymmetry cannot be explained
by current version of standard model.

144
00:11:51.241 --> 00:11:58.586
[SOUND]
