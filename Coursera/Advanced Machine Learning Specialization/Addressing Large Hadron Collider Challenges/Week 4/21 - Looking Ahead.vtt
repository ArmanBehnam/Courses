[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.408 --> 00:00:08.044
So, if we look into more realistic
challenges that are a little

3
00:00:08.044 --> 00:00:11.981
closer to SHiP experiment in search for
dark matter,

4
00:00:11.981 --> 00:00:15.840
we have to take into account
the following aspects.

5
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:21.340
The first one is that there are much
more showers in the volume with

6
00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.980
significant overlapping probability,
and no origin is available.

7
00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:33.660
And background is also different,
so it is not random like

8
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.980
in case of opera, it is going to be
a mixture of other tracks passing through.

9
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.675
And another thing that
in SHiP experiment they

10
00:00:44.675 --> 00:00:49.760
intend to add timing information
by adding additional sensitive

11
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.940
detectors that will produce
information as showers passes through.

12
00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.260
So it will may add additional
sensitivity of experiment,

13
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.730
but it will give additional challenge
from machine learning perspective.

14
00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.510
So you would have to take into account

15
00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.408
information coming from
additional detector.

16
00:01:09.408 --> 00:01:15.832
So to conclude,
we have started to look at very broad

17
00:01:15.832 --> 00:01:21.410
question, how can we find a dark matter?

18
00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.230
Since it is the most challenging
topic in physics agenda.

19
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.150
There are many questions,
many hypotheses, many approaches and

20
00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:30.970
just focused on one approach.

21
00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:36.180
That is explored by SHiP experiment that

22
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.650
is going to be designed and
built at CERN in several years.

23
00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.720
And we'll look at one of the strategies
that SHiP is going to explore

24
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.220
and it is based on the finding
of electromagnetic showers.

25
00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.870
Where machine learning can be really
helpful for reconstruction and

26
00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:05.957
finding properties of those showers in
the volume of emulsion trial chambers.

27
00:02:05.957 --> 00:02:11.845
And of course it was some approximation
because we use opera data sets.

28
00:02:11.845 --> 00:02:15.775
In the future, we expect to get
more realistic data samples,

29
00:02:15.775 --> 00:02:21.422
maybe in a new version of this course,
it will be a little more realistic.

30
00:02:21.422 --> 00:02:23.022
But speaking of reality,

31
00:02:23.022 --> 00:02:28.412
there are many more machine learning
challenges associated with the experiment.

32
00:02:28.412 --> 00:02:32.962
So the design of the experiment
is one of the critical

33
00:02:32.962 --> 00:02:35.052
tasks that we are going to focus on.

34
00:02:35.052 --> 00:02:40.782
Maybe also in future version of this
course we will add this information.

35
00:02:40.782 --> 00:02:45.858
But actually in the fifth lecture,
we'll touch this topic a little bit,

36
00:02:45.858 --> 00:02:51.050
and the tasks of particle identification

37
00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:56.110
would also be quite interesting in
the settings of this experiment.

38
00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.120
Than you, very much for
your attention, and

39
00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.490
hopefully you will enjoy your home task
as much as you enjoyed this lecture.

40
00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:11.561
Thank you.
