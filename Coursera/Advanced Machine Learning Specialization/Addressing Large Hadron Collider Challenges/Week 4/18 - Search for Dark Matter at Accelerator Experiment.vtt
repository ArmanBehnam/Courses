1
00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:09.130
So if we look at different strategies
that exist at accelerator probing for

2
00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.270
something beyond standard model.

3
00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:15.192
So if you take at look at this picture,
the horizontal axis,

4
00:00:15.192 --> 00:00:20.600
there is energy scale that
responds to mass of the particle.

5
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:29.310
And there is a vertical axis that is
interaction strength of the particle.

6
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.020
There is a region that is very well
studied and there is no new physics,

7
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.180
no dark matter,
everything populated by standard model.

8
00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.730
And there are two directions

9
00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.820
that may give us a hint about
presence of something new.

10
00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.500
So one direction is so
called Energy Frontier.

11
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.910
So the hypotheses are, there are particles
really heavy, really massive and

12
00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:00.890
to get to those region we need to
produce collision with higher energy

13
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:07.690
and this is actually the strategy that
large hadron collider follows for years.

14
00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:13.590
And there is alternative direction
that is called intensity frontier that

15
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:21.110
suggests that there are weakly interacting
particles like neutrinos or something else

16
00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.770
that their probability of interaction
with our regular matter is really low.

17
00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.910
To get the hints of such directions,

18
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:35.970
we need to produce a very big amount
of regular particles like neutrinos,

19
00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:42.580
to estimate proportions or estimate
the properties of those particles.

20
00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.180
So one of the hypotheses that
explains the nature of dark matter

21
00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.370
is called very
Weakly Interacting Massive Particles.

22
00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:57.222
Those can be mediators of dark matter or
even dark matter particles themselves.

23
00:01:57.222 --> 00:02:02.210
So it's just a small segment
in the plenitude of different

24
00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.900
models that try to explain
what Dark Matter consist of,

25
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.550
naturally it is not
very remodel dependent.

26
00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.780
It just says that, okay, we are looking
for something that has mass and

27
00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:20.200
certain range and that interacts with
regular matter with certain probabilities.

28
00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.987
Actually, you can follow the reference
links to get more details about

29
00:02:24.987 --> 00:02:26.114
those physics.

30
00:02:26.114 --> 00:02:30.545
But let's look at
the CERN Accelerator Complex and

31
00:02:30.545 --> 00:02:35.078
see that there is room for
many more accelerators and

32
00:02:35.078 --> 00:02:40.670
many more experiments than we described or
we used to think.

33
00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.810
We describe it the first time.

34
00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.860
So besides prominent CMS, LHCb,
ATLAS and ALICE there are places or

35
00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:54.430
accelerators that are somehow
attached to different detectors.

36
00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.792
And if we're looking for
place where intensity

37
00:02:59.792 --> 00:03:04.214
of a beam can reach really high values,

38
00:03:04.214 --> 00:03:09.979
it is so-called SBS ring
that accelerates protons

39
00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:15.492
before they get to a large
hadron collider ring.

40
00:03:15.492 --> 00:03:19.012
It is colored by blue on this picture.

41
00:03:19.012 --> 00:03:24.948
And there is so-called north
area where beam goes to,

42
00:03:24.948 --> 00:03:29.428
and the plan is to build
an experiment there that

43
00:03:29.428 --> 00:03:33.580
will be looking for dark matter particles.

44
00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.140
There is a proposed experiment that is
called search for hidden particles.

45
00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.870
You see the design of this experiment and
the picture and

46
00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.880
it is of essentially light dark
matter search experiment and

47
00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:53.750
the data taking is expected
to start in 2025 plus.

48
00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.390
So here is a principal
design of the experiment.

49
00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:03.030
So the beam of protons comes from
the left and hits a massive target.

50
00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.310
And the sensitive part of this experiment,
allocated in the middle,

51
00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.970
you see it is depicted by grey something,
and

52
00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:17.070
another sensitive part is located
at the most downstream region.

53
00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.790
It is depicted by the green tracker.

54
00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.410
Those two elements
are actually looking for

55
00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:29.110
weakly interacting particles following
those strategies I mentioned before.

56
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.610
This grey thing is called emulsion and

57
00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:40.580
a target, lead target, that looks for

58
00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:45.840
electron trajectory scattered by dark

59
00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:51.058
matter particles hitting those atoms,
hitting atoms of lead.

60
00:04:51.058 --> 00:04:54.950
It is so-called direct interaction.

61
00:04:54.950 --> 00:05:00.110
And another sensitive part of
the experiment is located downstream.

62
00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:05.745
So presumably a dark matter particle
flies through the detector and

63
00:05:05.745 --> 00:05:10.090
somewhere in this red volume,

64
00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:15.360
it decays into a normal particle that
we can detect like a muon and a pion.

65
00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:21.862
So we can reconstruct
trajectories of those particles

66
00:05:21.862 --> 00:05:28.134
using tracker techniques,
we mentioned at the previous lecture.

67
00:05:28.134 --> 00:05:32.821
And if we'll construct the vertex
those two particles and

68
00:05:32.821 --> 00:05:36.740
its located inside this volume of decay,
then,

69
00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:43.350
we can deduce the probability of being
such particle, an example of dark matter.

70
00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:49.200
So it is the second search
strategy that is called indirect.

71
00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:55.500
So of course, we have to be able to
protect the volume of direct and

72
00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:00.740
indirect sensitive parts from a vast
amount of regular particles like muons and

73
00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:03.680
that's why this blue

74
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:08.140
thing is sitting between the beam and
the sensitive element.

75
00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:13.020
It is so-called magnetic muon-shield
that is supposed to deflect or

76
00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:21.300
absorb as much as possible the radiation of muons or
other hadrons coming from the target.

77
00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:28.116
So SHiP experiment has very rich
scientific physics problem.

78
00:06:28.116 --> 00:06:32.489
Such for hidden sector portals,
tau neutrino physics or

79
00:06:32.489 --> 00:06:35.290
light dark matter search.

80
00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:38.000
Of course,
there are engineering challenges.

81
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.310
For example, how can you design
such a shield that it will be

82
00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:47.490
as efficient as possible with
a given amount of particles or

83
00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:51.650
given energies that we
expect to get from the beam.

84
00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:57.530
And machine learning challenges
are ranging from experiment design,

85
00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:00.927
including shield optimization,
emulsion tracker,

86
00:07:00.927 --> 00:07:05.850
emulsion-sensitive detector optimization,
tracker optimization.

87
00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:10.710
So with the respect to sensitivity and
cost,

88
00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:15.330
also fast simulation and
fast data processing and

89
00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:22.060
the most important part is separation
of signal, that comes from

90
00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:27.150
dark metal particles and direction,
from the background that we are aware of.

91
00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:32.600
So what kind of light dark
matter signal can look like?

92
00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:38.080
So here is a final diagram of dark
matter particle X scattering on

93
00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:43.670
electron of lead nuclei.

94
00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:48.370
And the boost the electron get,

95
00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:53.470
it get transferred for
the volume of the detector.

96
00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:57.910
And there is so-called
electromagnetic shower that

97
00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:00.050
is produced after such interaction.

98
00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:07.628
So the hint or the very distinct
feature that we will be looking for

99
00:08:07.628 --> 00:08:13.230
inside of detector volume
is such air shower.

100
00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:20.250
So here is an example of a shower produced
by an electron with a certain energy.

101
00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:26.390
So every track here, very short track,

102
00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:30.750
is recorded by a very sensitive
element that is called emulsion.

103
00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:32.880
We'll talk about it a little bit later.

104
00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:36.620
But first, let's take a look at
how background can look like.

105
00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:43.010
So here, we can see various
types of interaction that

106
00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:48.085
come through neutrino in
directing with nuclei, or

107
00:08:48.085 --> 00:08:51.180
in directing with atomic electrons.

108
00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:55.750
So the first type of interaction is
called quasi-elastic scattering.

109
00:08:55.750 --> 00:09:00.170
It is depicted at the left
part of the slide.

110
00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:02.970
So when neutrino interacts with a neutron,

111
00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:07.980
it also produces an electron
that get boosted.

112
00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:12.140
And at the same time,
a neutrino transforms into a proton.

113
00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:20.200
So there is also an electromagnetic
shower produced as well,

114
00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:25.450
there is a trajectory of a single
proton that can be found.

115
00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:29.970
And if we measured it, it could be a good
sign that it was a neutrino interaction,

116
00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:31.660
not dark matter interaction.

117
00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:37.470
Also, there is deep inelastic scattering,
it is depicted at the bottom.

118
00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:42.269
This is a little more complicated
because in addition to

119
00:09:42.269 --> 00:09:48.409
the electromagnetic shower and
proton, we also get an hadron shower.

120
00:09:48.409 --> 00:09:53.325
And the most difficult type of
background is called elastic

121
00:09:53.325 --> 00:09:58.439
scattering on electron which
looks topologically the same as

122
00:09:58.439 --> 00:10:03.552
our signal because we also have
electromagnetic shower, and

123
00:10:03.552 --> 00:10:09.770
we have a neutrino that is not leaving
any traces in volume of our detector.

124
00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:14.450
So it looks like just electromagnetic
shower flying out of nowhere.

125
00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:20.580
But the thing is, we can look at
the energy and angle distribution

126
00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:27.105
to see if there are some differences
between those two patterns.

127
00:10:27.105 --> 00:10:33.110
So signal/background separation
strategy falls the following guideline.

128
00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:36.980
It starts with discovery
of electromagnetic shower

129
00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:38.850
in the volume of our detector.

130
00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:43.448
Then for background,
the final state is a little bit different,

131
00:10:43.448 --> 00:10:48.044
because we expect to find a proton or
a hadron jet that gives us hint

132
00:10:48.044 --> 00:10:52.826
that it was in directional neutrino
instead of that meta particle.

133
00:10:52.826 --> 00:10:57.889
And for the case when we don't have
different particles in the final state,

134
00:10:57.889 --> 00:11:02.400
we can compare energy-angle
correlation of the detected electron

135
00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:06.199
to discriminate very weakly
directing massive particle

136
00:11:06.199 --> 00:11:10.990
against neutrino because those
masses should be different.

137
00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:19.796
And to get information about
trajectories of subatomic particles,

138
00:11:19.796 --> 00:11:25.884
we have to use very
precise detector material.

139
00:11:25.884 --> 00:11:28.493
