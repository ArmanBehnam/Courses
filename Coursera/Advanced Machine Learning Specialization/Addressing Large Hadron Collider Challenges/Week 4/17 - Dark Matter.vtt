00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:09.770
Hello everyone, in this week we're going to talk about search for dark matter.

2
00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:12.995
We're living at really fascinating times,

3
00:00:12.995 --> 00:00:14.995
you see in the map,

4
00:00:14.995 --> 00:00:18.685
this is a map of the world at time of Ptolemy.

5
00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:22.595
So, it has been around thousands years ago.

6
00:00:22.595 --> 00:00:29.580
This is pretty much what people like in Greece knew about the rest of the world.

7
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.895
So, you see there is no Australia, no America,

8
00:00:32.895 --> 00:00:37.700
no Antarctic and the situation at those times

9
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.580
is pretty similar to the situation that now because well,

10
00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:48.790
we don't know much about most of the matter that floats around us.

11
00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:50.425
I mean dark matter.

12
00:00:50.425 --> 00:00:57.694
So the scientists, looking at the rotation of galaxies have came to conclusion

13
00:00:57.694 --> 00:01:01.460
that there are five times more mass

14
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.150
than mass that we are used to encounter with on daily basis.

15
00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:13.760
Namely, if you look at how fast peripherical parts of galaxies rotate,

16
00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.240
you will see that the speed of this rotation is more or

17
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.990
less the same as the speed at the center of those galaxies.

18
00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.130
So, it means that there is something

19
00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.950
more mass that is rotating along the stars in the galaxies,

20
00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.560
but this mass doesn't emit any kind of radiation,

21
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.105
any kind of light, but it is there.

22
00:01:38.105 --> 00:01:41.775
Another clue about existence of this mass,

23
00:01:41.775 --> 00:01:46.405
of this dark mass is so-called gravitational lensing.

24
00:01:46.405 --> 00:01:51.350
So, if we look at the tiny patch of the sky we can see a galaxy there,

25
00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.660
because there are billions of galaxies out there.

26
00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:02.530
Sometimes, if we look a little bit different angle we can see exactly same galaxy,

27
00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.234
a little bit distorted.

28
00:02:04.234 --> 00:02:06.595
It is depicted at the slide,

29
00:02:06.595 --> 00:02:09.190
so you have two identical galaxy,

30
00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.250
is a little bit distorted run from another,

31
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.330
but those are the same objects.

32
00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.815
This happens due to the effect that is called gravitational lensing.

33
00:02:21.815 --> 00:02:24.975
So, here is a schematic representation what happens.

34
00:02:24.975 --> 00:02:26.935
So, if we have a massive objects,

35
00:02:26.935 --> 00:02:31.535
it shapes their space around it, change the curvature,

36
00:02:31.535 --> 00:02:37.210
and the straight lines in the presence of this object are not exactly straight,

37
00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.825
if we look from a different frame.

38
00:02:39.825 --> 00:02:45.210
So, a real object that we observe actually emits two different beams of

39
00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.270
light and those two beams get curved

40
00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.420
a little bit and we'll look at those two different lights,

41
00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.170
and if we project the trajectory of the light for their own,

42
00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:01.155
we can think of the same real object as two different images.

43
00:03:01.155 --> 00:03:07.230
All right. This is something that has been noticed many years ago,

44
00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.310
and the magnitude of this effect sometimes can be

45
00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.685
explained by the mass that sits between us and the real object,

46
00:03:15.685 --> 00:03:18.240
but sometimes and we can measure this mass if it is

47
00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.150
a black hole or star or a galaxy, another galaxy.

48
00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:27.510
But sometimes the mass of this object is not enough to

49
00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:34.330
explain the curvature or the bending of the light trajectories.

50
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:41.315
So, this is another clue that gives us hint about the presence of something else.

51
00:03:41.315 --> 00:03:44.035
So, why do we bother,

52
00:03:44.035 --> 00:03:47.710
because no presence of dark matter has been found around

53
00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:52.450
us at the acceleration experiments or other experiments yet,

54
00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.065
but still it's quite fascinating topic

55
00:03:56.065 --> 00:04:01.300
because it means that there are forces that we have no clue about,

56
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:05.365
and there are particles that also we have no clue about.

57
00:04:05.365 --> 00:04:09.050
The goal and the challenge is how can

58
00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:15.395
we design an experiment that would allow us to see those objects

59
00:04:15.395 --> 00:04:16.700
and allow us to operate with

60
00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.260
those particles in our daily basis and eventually maybe we can

61
00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.380
come to design the technology that would allow us to use

62
00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.760
this in other source of energy maybe.

63
00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.450
Actually, there are two big challenges related to discovery of dark matter.

64
00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:36.260
The first one is that we don't know what we're looking for,

65
00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.120
because there are plenty of theories that

66
00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:45.295
tries to compete with each other and try to predict presence of dark matter,

67
00:04:45.295 --> 00:04:53.200
and there is no clear explanation what kind of effect we should be looking for.

68
00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.630
The second big challenge is that there is no totally clean,

69
00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.300
observable that we can look at,

70
00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.980
measure and say that,

71
00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.125
okay, we have a hint of a dark matter.

72
00:05:05.125 --> 00:05:10.730
So, there are two strategies that scientists follow to discover dark matter.

73
00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:13.245
The first one is a direct search.

74
00:05:13.245 --> 00:05:18.640
So, the direct means that we design an experiment and we hope that the particle of

75
00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.550
a dark matter comes into the sensitive volume of

76
00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.940
this experiment and somehow excites anything,

77
00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:30.400
any particle, any atom or a subatomic thing inside this volume,

78
00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.750
and then we will have some kind of recoil energy

79
00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:39.435
measured by light charge or whatever inside this experiment.

80
00:05:39.435 --> 00:05:45.650
There are several detectors that are working in this mode.

81
00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:47.960
Well actually, there are plenty of them,

82
00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.265
but no hint so far.

83
00:05:50.265 --> 00:05:55.845
The second approach is a little bit more complicated because it implies

84
00:05:55.845 --> 00:06:01.670
that we can see a result of interaction of dark matter with something else,

85
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:09.000
maybe with dark matter or something else and we can discriminate the first thing,

86
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.410
we can detect the particle that comes out of this interaction and then we can

87
00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:15.960
discriminate such interaction from interaction of

88
00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.045
a regular mass or regular particles with each other.

89
00:06:19.045 --> 00:06:23.055
So, this is something that is a bit complicated

90
00:06:23.055 --> 00:06:24.900
because we don't know what kind of processes are

91
00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.430
happening and the star or distant galaxies,

92
00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:30.800
but this approach may sound much more

93
00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:36.430
applicable to the accelerator-based search of dark matter
