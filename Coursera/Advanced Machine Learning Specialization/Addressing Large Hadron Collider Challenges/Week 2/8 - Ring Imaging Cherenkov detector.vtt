00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.240
In this video, we will talk about Ring-imaging Cherenkov detector.

2
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:16.350
The Ring-imaging Cherenkov detector is responsible for the particle type identification.

3
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.190
The particle types are muon,

4
00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:23.265
kaon, pion, proton, and electron.

5
00:00:23.265 --> 00:00:27.335
To identify a particle type the detector uses

6
00:00:27.335 --> 00:00:33.115
a particle track and its momentum estimated in the tracking system.

7
00:00:33.115 --> 00:00:38.910
The Ring-imaging Cherenkov detector is located before the calorimeter systems,

8
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.350
because it doesn't affect the flight of particles.

9
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.710
However, the detector stands after the tracking system

10
00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.710
due to it uses tracks recognized in the tracking system.

11
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.825
Consider how it works.

12
00:00:54.825 --> 00:01:01.075
The RICH detector is based on the Cherenkov radiation effect.

13
00:01:01.075 --> 00:01:05.470
This effect describes a particle behavior in

14
00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:11.970
material when it flies with a speed higher than the speed of light in this material.

15
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:18.720
When the particle flies with such speed, it emits light.

16
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.890
Let's look at the example.

17
00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:27.535
Consider a particle flying with speed v in material with

18
00:01:27.535 --> 00:01:34.220
refractive index n. We will detect the light emitted by the particle.

19
00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.250
So, it's important to use transparent materials.

20
00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:45.290
Typically, different gases are used in RICH detectors.

21
00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.090
The refractive index of material is a ratio of the speed of

22
00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.305
light in vacuum to the speed of light in this material.

23
00:01:55.305 --> 00:02:00.650
When speed of the particle is larger than the speed of light in this material,

24
00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.010
the particle emits photons in the cone.

25
00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.170
Particles in high energy physics detectors fly with

26
00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.465
speed very close to the speed of light in vacuum.

27
00:02:10.465 --> 00:02:12.810
So, to emit light,

28
00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.850
these particles require small refractive indices close to one.

29
00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.355
Gases have such index values.

30
00:02:21.355 --> 00:02:26.285
Moreover, gases have almost no effect on the particle flight.

31
00:02:26.285 --> 00:02:32.510
The particle emits photons in the cone with emission angle zeta,

32
00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:38.625
The emission angle zeta is defined by the refractive index of the material,

33
00:02:38.625 --> 00:02:45.280
and the ratio of the particle speed to the speed of light in a vacuum as it shown on the slide.

34
00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.785
Let's look closer at this equation.

35
00:02:48.785 --> 00:02:55.670
It shows that the larger particles speed is a larger emission angle.

36
00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.610
The larger the refractive index of the material,

37
00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.615
the larger angle for a given particle speed.

38
00:03:02.615 --> 00:03:07.250
Let's estimate how the Cherenkov emission angle

39
00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.100
depends on the particle mass and momentum value.

40
00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.830
From relativistic physics, it's known that

41
00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.715
the particle momentum is defined by its mass and speed,

42
00:03:19.715 --> 00:03:23.285
as it's shown by the first equation on the slide.

43
00:03:23.285 --> 00:03:32.130
Here, beta is a ratio of the particle speed to the speed of light in the vacuum.

44
00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.345
From the first equation,

45
00:03:34.345 --> 00:03:37.030
we can estimate this ratio using

46
00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:42.410
the particle mass and momentum as it's shown by the second equation.

47
00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.440
Finally, we get the equation for cosine of

48
00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.740
the Cherenkov emission angle shown on the bottom of the slide.

49
00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:56.240
This equation shows that different particle types with different masses

50
00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:02.430
have different dependencies of the emission angle from the particle momentum.

51
00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.065
It allows to determine

52
00:04:05.065 --> 00:04:09.705
the particle mass using its momentum measured in the tracking system,

53
00:04:09.705 --> 00:04:15.025
and its emission angle estimated in the RICH detector.

54
00:04:15.025 --> 00:04:18.915
Consider examples of these dependencies.

55
00:04:18.915 --> 00:04:24.530
This slide demonstrates dependencies of the Cherenkov emission angle from

56
00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:31.190
a particle momentum for the different particle types in the LHCb experiment.

57
00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.975
So, if we know a particle momentum measured in the tracking system,

58
00:04:35.975 --> 00:04:40.250
and the emission angle measured at RICH detector,

59
00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.990
we can estimate the particle type,

60
00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.245
and as a result, it's mass.

61
00:04:46.245 --> 00:04:51.235
The detector identifies kaons, protons,

62
00:04:51.235 --> 00:04:53.020
and pions very well;

63
00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.965
however, muons behave similar to pions.

64
00:04:56.965 --> 00:05:01.740
Also, notice that it's difficult to separate these dependencies

65
00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:07.230
for the large emission angles and large particle momentum values.

66
00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:12.785
So, other detectors are needed to improve the particle identification.

67
00:05:12.785 --> 00:05:18.265
The RICH detector registers photons emitted by particles.

68
00:05:18.265 --> 00:05:24.620
This photons are shown as orange circles in the figure.

69
00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:31.475
The particle track position in the detector is represented as a blue triangle.

70
00:05:31.475 --> 00:05:35.825
Based on the emission angle for the particle,

71
00:05:35.825 --> 00:05:40.960
several circles for the different particle type hypotheses are plotted.

72
00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:47.250
The hypothesis with the largest number photons wins.

73
00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:52.165
However, it's not always easy to recognize correct circle.

74
00:05:52.165 --> 00:05:57.130
In this case, different machine learning approaches can be used to

75
00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:03.825
recognize rings and to identify a particle type in the RICH detector.

76
00:06:03.825 --> 00:06:08.650
The challenge is that these approaches have to be

77
00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:14.480
very fast to be able to process thousands of events per second.

78
00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:17.425
This is all about the RICH detector.

79
00:06:17.425 --> 00:06:24.380
In the next video, we will talk about calorimeters and how they measure particle energy.
