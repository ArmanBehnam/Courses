00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:09.385
Hello. On this week we will talk about detectors in the high energy physics.

2
00:00:09.385 --> 00:00:12.360
We'll view several detector designs and

3
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.115
consider different detector systems or subdetectors.

4
00:00:16.115 --> 00:00:24.280
We will see how these systems work and what particle parameters they measure.

5
00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.180
We'll learn how detectors recognize particles,

6
00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.830
measure their energy and momentum,

7
00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.765
and how they estimate particle types.

8
00:00:34.765 --> 00:00:37.610
Also, we will see several cases in

9
00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.275
high energy physics where machine learning can be successfully applied.

10
00:00:42.275 --> 00:00:44.100
At the end of this week,

11
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:51.820
you'll know how detectors work and what systems they have and what data they produce.

12
00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.885
And we start this week from a simple particle decay.

13
00:00:55.885 --> 00:01:03.400
Consider a particle D_0 that decays into two other particles: a pion and a kaon.

14
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:08.245
In this example, D_0 is also called as mother particle,

15
00:01:08.245 --> 00:01:13.220
and the kaon and the pion are called as daughter particles.

16
00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:19.420
Each of these particles has certain energy, momentum and mass.

17
00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:26.000
Energy and momentum of a particle are determined by speed of this particle.

18
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.405
Mass of the particle is defined by its type.

19
00:01:30.405 --> 00:01:33.120
In this case, in this example,

20
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.325
we have three particle types:

21
00:01:35.325 --> 00:01:37.610
D_0, pion and kaon.

22
00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:46.425
All pions have the same mass and its value is different from kaon mass, for an example.

23
00:01:46.425 --> 00:01:49.805
From the energy conservation law, we know that,

24
00:01:49.805 --> 00:01:56.900
energy of the mother particle D_0 is equal to the sum of the kaon and the pion energies.

25
00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.480
And from the momentum conservation law,

26
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.515
we know that momentum of D_0 particle is

27
00:02:03.515 --> 00:02:08.940
equal to the vector sum of the kaon and the pion momentums.

28
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.715
Also, we know that energy, momentum,

29
00:02:11.715 --> 00:02:16.300
and mass of a particle are connected by the equation shown on the slide.

30
00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.740
These equations allow to estimate mass of

31
00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.305
the mother particle D_0 using masses of the daughter particle's,

32
00:02:24.305 --> 00:02:26.870
their energy and momentum values.

33
00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:34.990
Also, this expression requires an angle between the kaon and the pion trajectories.

34
00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.740
However, the daughter particle trajectories

35
00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.335
are needed not only to measure the angle between them,

36
00:02:42.335 --> 00:02:45.545
but also to check that these particles,

37
00:02:45.545 --> 00:02:47.605
kaon and pion in our case,

38
00:02:47.605 --> 00:02:50.120
originate from the same point,

39
00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.905
from the same particle.

40
00:02:51.905 --> 00:02:57.490
It becomes more important when we have several decays at the same time.

41
00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:00.670
Detectors in high energy physics and

42
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.625
their different systems are needed to estimate a particle trajectory,

43
00:03:05.625 --> 00:03:09.720
momentum, energy, and its type to be able to

44
00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.525
recognize particle decays and to reconstruct parameters of mother particles.

45
00:03:14.525 --> 00:03:17.770
In this example, it's mass.

46
00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.270
On this week, we'll talk about different systems of

47
00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:24.710
detectors in high energy physics experiments.

48
00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:29.610
The systems or subdetectors are tracking system,

49
00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.665
ring-imaging Cherenkov detector,

50
00:03:31.665 --> 00:03:36.240
electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters, and muon chambers.

51
00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:41.295
Tracking system recognizes a particle trajectory or track,

52
00:03:41.295 --> 00:03:44.180
estimates parameters of this trajectory,

53
00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.200
and measures the particle momentum.

54
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.975
The ring-imaging Cherenkov detector estimates

55
00:03:50.975 --> 00:03:55.815
a particle type using its momentum measured in the tracking system.

56
00:03:55.815 --> 00:04:01.185
Electromagnetic and hadron calorimeters measure particle energy

57
00:04:01.185 --> 00:04:07.385
and muon chambers recognize muons and also estimate their energy.

58
00:04:07.385 --> 00:04:13.040
This week, we'll talk about how all these systems work and how they

59
00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:18.545
recognize particle trajectories and measure their energy and momentum values.

60
00:04:18.545 --> 00:04:22.475
Also, we'll talk about the particle identification.

61
00:04:22.475 --> 00:04:28.235
The goal of the particle identification or PID is to identify

62
00:04:28.235 --> 00:04:35.125
a type of a particle associated with a track using responses from different systems.

63
00:04:35.125 --> 00:04:38.190
Particle types are electron,

64
00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.110
proton, muon, kaon and pion.

65
00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.160
We will consider several machine learning approaches that

66
00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.505
help to identify a particle type with high quality.

67
00:04:49.505 --> 00:04:53.675
Moreover, we see how to provide

68
00:04:53.675 --> 00:04:59.495
independence of this quality from the particle momentum or other parameters.

69
00:04:59.495 --> 00:05:06.095
Consider several detector example on Large Hadron Collider at CERN.

70
00:05:06.095 --> 00:05:09.230
There are four major experiments at CERN.

71
00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:11.760
These experiments are LHCb,

72
00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.075
ATLAS, ALICE and CMS.

73
00:05:15.075 --> 00:05:16.840
From the previous week,

74
00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.235
you know that Large Hadron Collider has

75
00:05:20.235 --> 00:05:24.855
two beams of protons that fly in opposite directions.

76
00:05:24.855 --> 00:05:28.915
Each of these beams are divided into bunches.

77
00:05:28.915 --> 00:05:33.965
Each bunch has about 10 in 11 protons.

78
00:05:33.965 --> 00:05:40.250
Bunches of the beams cross each other inside the detectors.

79
00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:44.010
And there are several proton-proton collisions

80
00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:49.155
are generated inside the detector during the bunch crossing.

81
00:05:49.155 --> 00:05:52.525
The proton-proton collisions produce a lot of

82
00:05:52.525 --> 00:05:57.120
other particles that decay into other particles and so on.

83
00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.845
The detectors recognize these particles,

84
00:06:00.845 --> 00:06:05.120
estimates their types, and measures their energies and momentum.

85
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:12.280
Each bunch crossing with all generated particles is called an event.

86
00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:20.405
There're 40 millions events per seconds generated on Large Hadron Collider at CERN.

87
00:06:20.405 --> 00:06:23.315
Consider several event examples.

88
00:06:23.315 --> 00:06:28.275
Let's consider the LHCb detector example shown on the slide.

89
00:06:28.275 --> 00:06:32.474
LHCb is a single-arm forward spectrometer

90
00:06:32.474 --> 00:06:36.660
which registers particles flying in one direction.

91
00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:40.200
LHCb detects about 100 particles in

92
00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:45.715
an event producing by a proton-proton collision in the Large Hadron Collider.

93
00:06:45.715 --> 00:06:49.830
Trajectories of these particles and their responses in

94
00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:54.360
different detector systems are shown in the figure.

95
00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:59.410
Tracking system responses are shown as magenta and blue lights.

96
00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:02.870
Blue and orange cells represent

97
00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:09.280
calorimeter responses and green cells correspond to muon chambers.

98
00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:12.809
Follow the link on this slide you will find

99
00:07:12.809 --> 00:07:20.130
an interactive 3D model of the LHCb detector where you can look at these events.

100
00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:25.440
In the next video, we will look closer at each of these detector systems.

101
00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:29.200
The second example is the ATLAS detector.

102
00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:35.235
It has a cylindrical shape and registers particles in all directions.

103
00:07:35.235 --> 00:07:42.455
Each event has about 1000 particles from a proton-proton collision in the collider.

104
00:07:42.455 --> 00:07:45.830
The detector provides high precision of

105
00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:48.970
the particles detection and it's

106
00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:53.195
able to recognize decays with a lot of daughter particles.

107
00:07:53.195 --> 00:08:00.060
Example of such a decay is shown in the lower left corner of the slide.

108
00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:01.860
In the next video,

109
00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:07.280
we'll consider tracking system of a detector in high energy physics.

110
00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:14.270
We will see how it recognizes this particles trajectories and estimates their momentum.
