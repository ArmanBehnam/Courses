00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.926
[SOUND] In this video,

2
00:00:02.926 --> 00:00:07.968
we will talk about tracking system.

3
00:00:07.968 --> 00:00:12.052
The tracking system is the first
system of the detectors and

4
00:00:12.052 --> 00:00:16.060
stands before particle
collision area of a detector.

5
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:24.040
It's responsible for particle trajectories
recognition and their parameters estimation.

6
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.820
In additional,
the system has a magnet which

7
00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.560
deflects particles, and
allows to measure the particle momentum.

8
00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.150
The particle trajectories estimated in the
tracking system are extrapolated to the

9
00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.100
the ring-imaging Cherenkov detector,
calorimeters, and

10
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.130
muon chambers, and
are used by these systems.

11
00:00:48.256 --> 00:00:52.980
The ring imaging Cherenkov detector
also takes particle momentum

12
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.340
measured in the tracking system
to identify the particle type.

13
00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.600
We will talk about that in the next video,
but

14
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.100
now consider how
the tracking system works.

15
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.040
The tracking system has several
layers of sensors, and when

16
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.800
a particle flies through these layers,
it remains responses in the sensors.

17
00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.140
These response's are also called as hits.

18
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.130
Hits allow to recognize particle
tracks and estimate their parameters.

19
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.000
The problem of recognition hits
that belong to the same track

20
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.380
is called track pattern recognition.

21
00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.790
There are variety of track pattern
recognition methods in high

22
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.400
energy physics.

23
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:47.320
And the most popular are methods based
on hough transform and Kalman filter.

24
00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:53.620
Also range of track pattern recognition
methods, based on Hopfield neural networks,

25
00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:58.420
and were developed in 1980s.

26
00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.340
The most popular of these methods
are Denby-Peterson method and

27
00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:04.600
cellular automaton.

28
00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.160
They are more sophisticated than
the Kalman filter-based methods and

29
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.040
require more computational resources.

30
00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:19.350
But on the other hand, they provide better
quality of the track pattern recognition.

31
00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.145
Especially in high track
density experiments.

32
00:02:23.145 --> 00:02:27.380
Moreover, there are a lot of
modern machine learning methods for

33
00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.215
clustering and classification,
including convolution neural networks and

34
00:02:32.215 --> 00:02:37.400
recurrent neural networks that are also
successfully applied in this problem.

35
00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.088
For an example,
neural networks are used to classify

36
00:02:43.088 --> 00:02:47.744
recognized hit combination
into correct or wrong.

37
00:02:47.744 --> 00:02:52.843
Recurrent neural networks
consider hit sequences

38
00:02:52.843 --> 00:02:59.057
in the tracking system layers to
predict the next hit of the track.

39
00:03:00.466 --> 00:03:06.003
However, speed of the track pattern
recognition is one of the most important

40
00:03:06.003 --> 00:03:11.240
aspects, and this is a challenge for
the machine learning approaches.

41
00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.771
And then to this week, you will find
references to papers about machine

42
00:03:15.771 --> 00:03:18.738
learning in the track
particle recognition.

43
00:03:18.738 --> 00:03:21.942
Except particle track recognition,

44
00:03:21.942 --> 00:03:26.379
the tracking system also
measures particle momentum.

45
00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.150
To do this,
the tracking system has a magnet.

46
00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.940
Magnetic field deflects charged particles.

47
00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:39.440
It's known from physics that
in the uniform magnetic field,

48
00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:45.760
a particle flies on a circle, and
the radius of this circle is proportional

49
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.890
to the magnetic field, and to the particle
momentum as it's shown on the slide.

50
00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.780
So to estimate a particle momentum,

51
00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.180
it's needed to somehow
measure radius of the circle.

52
00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:06.480
To do this, there are several additional
sensor layers after the magnet.

53
00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.150
These layers estimate track
parameters after the magnet.

54
00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.140
Knowing particle track slopes before and
after the magnet,

55
00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:20.908
we can calculate the particle
deflection in the magnetic field and

56
00:04:20.908 --> 00:04:24.570
estimate its radius, and
as result, momentum.

57
00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.430
Consider several tracking system examples.

58
00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:35.250
In LHCb, the tracking system has
the same form as on the previous slide.

59
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:41.430
The magnet of the system is
shown in the center of the figure.

60
00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:46.420
The magnetic field deflects the charged
particles, shown as colored lines.

61
00:04:48.475 --> 00:04:56.230
At the LHCb magnetic field is not uniform but
its shape is known,

62
00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:01.600
and allows to estimate a particle
momentum based on its deflection.

63
00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:08.230
Also, there are several layers of
sensors before and after the magnet.

64
00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:14.015
Track hits in these layers are marked
by blue and magenta colors.

65
00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:20.350
Notice that there are two sets
of the layers before the magnet.

66
00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:25.170
The first one is exactly
before the magnet.

67
00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:31.360
These layers are used to measure particle
deflection in the magnetic field.

68
00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:35.930
The second set of sensor layers

69
00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:40.270
is in the collision area at
the beginning of the detector.

70
00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:45.052
These sensors provide high
precision of track parameters

71
00:05:45.052 --> 00:05:49.700
estimation to be able to
combine particles into decays.

72
00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:55.780
Then these particles are used
to estimate properties of

73
00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:58.300
mother particles correspond
to these decays.

74
00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:03.850
In the Atlas experiment the tracking
system has a cylindrical shape.

75
00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:09.850
The sensor layers are located
inside uniform magnetic field.

76
00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:12.990
So particle tracks are circles parts.

77
00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.710
Hits of these tracks are shown
as color dots in the figure.

78
00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:24.281
This tracking system have several
groups of sensor layers with different

79
00:06:24.281 --> 00:06:27.221
precision of hit coordinates measurement.

80
00:06:28.689 --> 00:06:33.562
As the most precise sensors are in
the center of the tracking system,

81
00:06:33.562 --> 00:06:36.430
where the track's density is the highest.

82
00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:39.960
These sensors are silicon pixels,

83
00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:44.420
that are similar to those
used in photo cameras.

84
00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:50.774
All tracks in the figure
originate only from two decays and

85
00:06:50.774 --> 00:06:55.509
silicon pixels are able
to recognize these decays.

86
00:06:55.509 --> 00:07:01.660
However, these sensors are very expensive
to use them to cover large volumes.

87
00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:04.275
So there are silicon strips and

88
00:07:04.275 --> 00:07:09.280
straw tubes with gas inside in the outer
regions of the tracking system.

89
00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:13.039
The sensors are more cheaper but

90
00:07:13.039 --> 00:07:17.479
provide to lower precision of
hit coordinates measurement.

91
00:07:17.479 --> 00:07:21.608
In the next video,
we will see how particle tracks and

92
00:07:21.608 --> 00:07:27.558
their momentum estimated in the tracking
system are used in other detector system.

93
00:07:27.558 --> 00:07:34.713
