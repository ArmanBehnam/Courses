00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.160
In this video, we will talk

2
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.340
about how to use a particle responses in

3
00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.905
the detector systems for the particle type identification.

4
00:00:13.905 --> 00:00:19.100
The goal of the particle identification is to identify a type of

5
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:25.295
a particle associated with a track using responses from different detector systems.

6
00:00:25.295 --> 00:00:28.005
There are five particle types:

7
00:00:28.005 --> 00:00:32.955
Electron, Proton, Kaon, Pion and Muon.

8
00:00:32.955 --> 00:00:37.710
There are five different detector systems: Tracking system,

9
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.875
Ring Imaging Cherenkov detector,

10
00:00:39.875 --> 00:00:45.500
Electromagnetic calorimeter and Hadron calorimeter and finally Muon Chambers.

11
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.284
The particle identification problem can be considered

12
00:00:49.284 --> 00:00:53.730
as multi-classification problem in machine learning.

13
00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:02.850
A particle track responses in the detector systems are used as inputs of a classifier.

14
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:09.305
For an example, tracking systems provide information about particle track parameters,

15
00:01:09.305 --> 00:01:13.140
track fit quality, particle momentum and charge,

16
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:21.090
and also decay vertex coordinates. RICH detector gives a particle emission angle

17
00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.700
or delta likelihood for

18
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:30.135
a different particle type hypotheses or quality of circles fit in the detector.

19
00:01:30.135 --> 00:01:34.060
Calorimeters measure a particle energy and

20
00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.110
number of responses for these particle for an example,

21
00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:45.600
Muon system tells is a track has hits inside the system or not,

22
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.305
and how much active chambers correspond to the track.

23
00:01:50.305 --> 00:01:52.770
There are many other features.

24
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.250
Outputs of the classifier are six labels.

25
00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.025
Five of them correspond to five different particle types.

26
00:02:00.025 --> 00:02:04.740
Muon, Kaon, Pion, Proton and Electron.

27
00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.930
The last one corresponds to all other particle types,

28
00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:13.935
and just noisy tracks that are called Ghosts.

29
00:02:13.935 --> 00:02:20.570
Ghost is a track that was recognized by mistake by a track pattern recognition method,

30
00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:25.330
and doesn't correspond to any real particle in the detector.

31
00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.640
So, for each track recognized in the detector,

32
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:36.110
the classifier gives probabilities to belong to each of these particle types.

33
00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.825
This problem can be solved in different modes.

34
00:02:39.825 --> 00:02:42.270
In the multi-classification mode,

35
00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:50.880
in one particle versus rest particles mode or in one particle versus one particle mode.

36
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.650
For an example, one particle versus rest mode means that you

37
00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.990
train a classifier to separate one particle from all other particles.

38
00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:07.845
Modern detectors in high energy physics provide high quality of particle identification.

39
00:03:07.845 --> 00:03:11.305
In terms of the area under the ROC curve,

40
00:03:11.305 --> 00:03:20.450
it corresponds to values in the range from 0.9 to 0.995 depending on the particle type.

41
00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.915
In your programming assignment for this week,

42
00:03:23.915 --> 00:03:27.160
you will be able to train your own classifier for

43
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.515
the particle identification using toy Monte Carlo sample,

44
00:03:31.515 --> 00:03:36.555
you will estimate the quality of the identification for each particle type.

45
00:03:36.555 --> 00:03:38.595
In the machine learning community,

46
00:03:38.595 --> 00:03:41.735
ROC curve is plotted as a dependence of

47
00:03:41.735 --> 00:03:45.600
the true positive rate from the false positive rate.

48
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.925
However, in the high energy physics,

49
00:03:48.925 --> 00:03:52.120
ROC curve is plotted as the dependence of

50
00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.425
the one minus false positive rate from true positive rate.

51
00:03:57.425 --> 00:04:00.975
One minus false positive rate is called

52
00:04:00.975 --> 00:04:06.645
Background Rejection and true positive rate is called Signal Efficiency.

53
00:04:06.645 --> 00:04:10.165
Quality of the particle identification

54
00:04:10.165 --> 00:04:14.925
depends on particle parameters such as its momentum,

55
00:04:14.925 --> 00:04:17.380
transverse momentum or energy.

56
00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:23.670
The figure on the slide demonstrates strong dependency of the area under the ROC curve

57
00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:30.605
for a particle type separated from all other types from the particle momentum.

58
00:04:30.605 --> 00:04:36.805
The quality significantly drops in the low and high momentum regions.

59
00:04:36.805 --> 00:04:41.580
Moreover, it's preferable to have no such dependencies.

60
00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.310
In other words, we would like to have

61
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.250
flat or uniform dependency of

62
00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:51.935
the particle identification quality on the different particle parameters.

63
00:04:51.935 --> 00:04:54.185
Consider one more example.

64
00:04:54.185 --> 00:05:00.585
Consider a classifier that separates one particle type as a signal versus

65
00:05:00.585 --> 00:05:04.380
the rest particle types as background.

66
00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:08.475
Output of this classifier is shown at the bottom of the slide.

67
00:05:08.475 --> 00:05:13.560
Let's select the classifier output threshold value that

68
00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:19.125
corresponds to the 60 percent of the global signal efficiency.

69
00:05:19.125 --> 00:05:27.970
It means that this threshold selects 60 percent of all signal particles in the sample.

70
00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:32.060
However, in different particle transverse momentum regions,

71
00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:38.230
the signal efficiency differs from the global one as it's demonstrated in the top figure.

72
00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:42.740
In several regions, the efficiency is higher than 60 percent.

73
00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.105
But also, there are a lot of regions where

74
00:05:46.105 --> 00:05:50.365
the signal efficiency is much lower than 60 percent.

75
00:05:50.365 --> 00:05:56.055
Such effects bring systematic uncertainties to physics analysis.

76
00:05:56.055 --> 00:06:01.205
And it's preferable when the classifier selects the same ratio of

77
00:06:01.205 --> 00:06:06.735
signal particles on each momentum or transverse momentum regions for example.

78
00:06:06.735 --> 00:06:12.275
Similar dependencies are present is modern high energy physics experiments.

79
00:06:12.275 --> 00:06:20.285
For an example, the figure shown on the slide is provided by the LHCb experiment.

80
00:06:20.285 --> 00:06:24.430
The figure demonstrates dependencies of the power and

81
00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:29.900
efficiency from its transverse momentum for two different classifiers,

82
00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.610
and for three different global efficiencies:

83
00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:36.380
60 percent, 80 percent and 90 percent.

84
00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:38.130
In the next video,

85
00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:41.170
we will consider several approaches how to train

86
00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:45.200
a classifier to avoid such dependencies.
