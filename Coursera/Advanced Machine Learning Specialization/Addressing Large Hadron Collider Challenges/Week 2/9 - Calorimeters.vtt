1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.045
In this video, we will talk about calorimeters.

2
00:00:07.045 --> 00:00:10.130
In this video, we will consider two calorimeters:

3
00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:13.605
electromagnetic calorimeter and hadron Calorimeter.

4
00:00:13.605 --> 00:00:19.259
Calorimeters are located after the tracking system and RICH detector,

5
00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:23.340
because they stop all particles except muons.

6
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.590
Electromagnetic calorimeter stops electrons and photons.

7
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.090
All other particles fly further to the hadron Calorimeter.

8
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.990
Hadron calorimeters stops protons,

9
00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.795
neutrons, and other particles containing quarks.

10
00:00:39.795 --> 00:00:43.375
In all high energy physics experiments,

11
00:00:43.375 --> 00:00:47.245
hadron calorimeters stands after the electromagnetic one.

12
00:00:47.245 --> 00:00:50.600
There are only muon chambers are after

13
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.730
the hadron calorimeter due to muons pass all detector systems.

14
00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.610
The calorimeters measure particle energies.

15
00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.845
They are based on similar principles but have

16
00:01:03.845 --> 00:01:08.430
differences in physics, processes, and composition.

17
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.185
Let's consider each of these calorimeters more detailed.

18
00:01:13.185 --> 00:01:18.440
So, the calorimeter system is designed to measure particle energy.

19
00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:25.500
Particles interact with much matter of calorimeter and lose their energy.

20
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:32.155
The calorimeter measures how much energy the particles lose before they stop.

21
00:01:32.155 --> 00:01:35.350
Let's start from the electromagnetic calorimeter.

22
00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.890
The electromagnetic calorimeter is responsible for

23
00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.835
measuring the energy of electrons and photons.

24
00:01:42.835 --> 00:01:46.790
Consider how the electromagnetic calorimeter works.

25
00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.610
Suppose an electron flies into the calorimeter.

26
00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.800
Interacting with a matter,

27
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:59.115
the electron emits a photon and change its own direction losing some energy.

28
00:01:59.115 --> 00:02:01.690
After this first step

29
00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.325
we have two particles

30
00:02:03.325 --> 00:02:09.660
and sum of the energies is equal to the energy of the original electron.

31
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.260
At the second step,

32
00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:18.275
the photon interacts with the matter and decays into an electron and a positron.

33
00:02:18.275 --> 00:02:20.040
In the same time,

34
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.150
the electron again emits other photon,

35
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.540
and again, changes its own direction and to lose energy.

36
00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.630
So, there are four particles and energy of

37
00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.580
the origin electron is distributed on these particles.

38
00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.550
In other words, with each step,

39
00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:46.080
the number of particles increases and energy of each of these particles decreases.

40
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:52.425
This process repeats a lot of times and creates an electromagnetic shower.

41
00:02:52.425 --> 00:02:57.090
During this process, the number of particles exponentially

42
00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:05.425
increases and sum of their energies is equal to the energy of the origin electron.

43
00:03:05.425 --> 00:03:13.615
So, energy of particles in the shower exponentially drops with each step of the process.

44
00:03:13.615 --> 00:03:21.225
Moreover, each step takes in average the same distance in the material of the detector.

45
00:03:21.225 --> 00:03:24.930
And as a result, particle energy in

46
00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.550
the electromagnetic shower exponentially drops with lengths of the shower.

47
00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.380
Let's formalize this.

48
00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.270
So, energy of a particle in

49
00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:41.050
the electromagnetic shower exponentially drops with its coordinates in

50
00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.270
the shower and proportional to

51
00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:50.520
the starting energy E_0 for the origin particle as it's shown on the slide.

52
00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:55.085
In this equation, X_0 represents

53
00:03:55.085 --> 00:04:00.255
average size of one step of the electromagnetic shower production.

54
00:04:00.255 --> 00:04:05.750
This value depends on material used in the calorimeter.

55
00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.795
The more dense material

56
00:04:07.795 --> 00:04:10.180
the smaller this value.

57
00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.820
This equation allows to estimate the shower size

58
00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:19.445
and number of particles in it. Let's consider that.

59
00:04:19.445 --> 00:04:23.790
Electromagnetic shower grows while the energy of

60
00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:30.030
the particles in the shower is above the critical value E_c.

61
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:36.615
The shower size X_max can be estimated as it's shown on the slide.

62
00:04:36.615 --> 00:04:41.020
The critical energy E_c as well as X_0

63
00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.375
in the equation are defined by the material of the calorimeter,

64
00:04:45.375 --> 00:04:51.000
and width of the calorimeter is selected to be larger than length of the shower.

65
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.475
The total number of particles in the shower is estimated as follow.

66
00:04:56.475 --> 00:05:01.070
It's proportional to the energy of the region particle E_0

67
00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:06.465
and inversely depends on the critical energy E_c.

68
00:05:06.465 --> 00:05:09.720
Measuring the number of particles allows

69
00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.560
to determine the energy of the incoming particle.

70
00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.460
This number is measured by scintillation counters.

71
00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:23.955
Their signal is proportional to the number of particles flies through the counters.

72
00:05:23.955 --> 00:05:27.850
Consider composition of the electromagnetic calorimeters.

73
00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:30.505
In the high energy physics experiments,

74
00:05:30.505 --> 00:05:36.685
electromagnetic calorimeters consist of a lot of crystals shown on the slide.

75
00:05:36.685 --> 00:05:40.380
The crystal creates an electromagnetic shower,

76
00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:48.135
and lengths of these crystals is selected to be larger than expected size of the shower.

77
00:05:48.135 --> 00:05:55.775
The crystals are transparent because a lot of particles in the shower are photons.

78
00:05:55.775 --> 00:06:00.425
Also, there is the scintillation counter after the crystal.

79
00:06:00.425 --> 00:06:04.140
It counts the number of particles in the shower.

80
00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:08.780
This number depends on the incoming particle energy,

81
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:14.860
and this dependence is estimated during the calorimeter calibration process.

82
00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:16.785
In the LHCb detector,

83
00:06:16.785 --> 00:06:22.185
a lot of these crystals are collected in the metrics as it's shown on the slide.

84
00:06:22.185 --> 00:06:24.480
In the LHCb detector model,

85
00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:30.270
the electromagnetic calorimeter responses are represented as blue colors.

86
00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:34.050
One particle can activate several crystals

87
00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:36.600
of the calorimeter.

88
00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:40.670
Thus, it's needed to recognize a crystal cluster

89
00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:45.370
corresponds to the particle to estimate the particle energy more precisely.

90
00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:49.450
To do this, a particle track estimated in

91
00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:55.040
the tracking system is extrapolated to the electromagnetic calorimeter.

92
00:06:55.040 --> 00:07:02.715
Then, crystals close to the track in the calorimeter are grouped into a cluster.

93
00:07:02.715 --> 00:07:05.725
And sum of energies measured in

94
00:07:05.725 --> 00:07:10.435
all crystals of the cluster corresponds to the particle energy.

95
00:07:10.435 --> 00:07:13.560
Machine learning approaches can be used to recognize

96
00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:18.060
these clusters and estimate the particle energy more accurate.

97
00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:25.785
Moreover, photons also create clusters in the calorimeter,

98
00:07:25.785 --> 00:07:32.440
but they have no hits in the tracking system and their tracks are not recognized.

99
00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:37.935
So, machine learning can be used to recognize clusters for

100
00:07:37.935 --> 00:07:44.440
photons and separate them from clusters for electrons or just noise clusters.

101
00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:51.025
So, electromagnetic calorimeters are also responsible for photons detection.

102
00:07:51.025 --> 00:07:56.595
Consider how calorimeters help to identify particle types.

103
00:07:56.595 --> 00:08:02.320
The equation of the slide represents the connection between energy,

104
00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:05.245
momentum, and mass of a particle.

105
00:08:05.245 --> 00:08:12.855
We already know that the particle energy is measured by calorimeters.

106
00:08:12.855 --> 00:08:15.270
In the previous videos,

107
00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:20.350
we see that momentum of the particle is measured by tracking systems.

108
00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:23.295
So, using this equation,

109
00:08:23.295 --> 00:08:28.250
we can estimate the particle mass and as a result it's type.

110
00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:33.705
However, in the next videos we will see how to use information from

111
00:08:33.705 --> 00:08:40.210
all detector systems to identify particle types more accurate.

112
00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:44.370
Now, let's talk about the Hadron Calorimeter.

113
00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:48.210
As it was told in the beginning of this video,

114
00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:51.710
electromagnetic calorimeter stops electrons and

115
00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:56.579
photons. Other particles fly further to the hadron calorimeter,

116
00:08:56.579 --> 00:09:00.910
and hadron calorimeter stops protons,

117
00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:04.460
neutrons, and other particles containing quarks.

118
00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:07.350
In high energy physics experiments,

119
00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:11.390
hadron calorimeters stands after the electromagnetic calorimeter.

120
00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:15.015
There are only muon chambers after the hadron calorimeter

121
00:09:15.015 --> 00:09:19.355
due to muons pass all detector systems.

122
00:09:19.355 --> 00:09:24.770
The hadron calorimeter is responsible for measuring the energy of protons,

123
00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:28.150
neutrons, and other particles containing quarks.

124
00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:31.370
The principle of the hadron calorimeter work

125
00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:35.125
is similar to the electromagnetic calorimeter one.

126
00:09:35.125 --> 00:09:40.710
But the incoming particle produces a hadronic shower instead of

127
00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:48.555
the electromagnetic shower due to interactions with the nuclei of matter atoms.

128
00:09:48.555 --> 00:09:53.925
The shower consists of large number of different particle types,

129
00:09:53.925 --> 00:09:56.800
not only electrons and photons.

130
00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:03.935
Number of particles in the shower exponentially increases with lengths of the shower.

131
00:10:03.935 --> 00:10:05.600
In the same time,

132
00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:08.315
energy of each particle in the shower

133
00:10:08.315 --> 00:10:13.265
exponentially drops as well as for the electromagnetic showers.

134
00:10:13.265 --> 00:10:17.860
Hadron showers are larger than the electromagnetic one,

135
00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:22.490
so the hadron calorimeter consists of several layers.

136
00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:26.990
Each layer has a layer of matter that creates

137
00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:28.670
a hadronic shower and

138
00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:33.920
this scintillation counter layer that counts number of particles in the shower.

139
00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:38.340
Unlike electromagnetic calorimeters, hadron calorimeters

140
00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:43.355
use heavy materials such as metals.

141
00:10:43.355 --> 00:10:45.765
In the LHCb detector model,

142
00:10:45.765 --> 00:10:51.055
the hadron calorimeter responses are represented as orange cells.

143
00:10:51.055 --> 00:10:54.620
Similarly to the electromagnetic calorimeter,

144
00:10:54.620 --> 00:11:00.040
one particle can activate several cells of the calorimeters, thus,

145
00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:03.530
it's needed to recognize a cluster of cells

146
00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:08.995
corresponds to the particle to estimate the particle energy more precisely.

147
00:11:08.995 --> 00:11:12.360
To do this, a particle track estimated in

148
00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:16.905
the tracking system is extrapolated to the hadron calorimeter.

149
00:11:16.905 --> 00:11:24.165
Then, cells close to the track in the calorimeter are grouped into a cluster,

150
00:11:24.165 --> 00:11:27.545
and sum of energies measured in

151
00:11:27.545 --> 00:11:32.410
all cells of the cluster corresponds to the particle energy.

152
00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:36.619
Again, machine learning approaches can be used to recognize

153
00:11:36.619 --> 00:11:41.820
these clusters and estimate the particle energy more accurate.

154
00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:44.410
This is all about the calorimeters,

155
00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:46.165
and in the next video,

156
00:11:46.165 --> 00:11:50.340
we'll talk about the last system of the detector.
