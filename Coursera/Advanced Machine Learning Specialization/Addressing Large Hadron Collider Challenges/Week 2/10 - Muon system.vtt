00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:08.675
In this video, we will talk about the last detector system, muon system.

2
00:00:08.675 --> 00:00:15.710
The muon system is responsible for the muons identification and their energy estimation.

3
00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:17.600
From the previous video,

4
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:23.440
we know that the calorimeters stop all particles except muons.

5
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:29.925
Muons weakly interact with matter and almost no responses in the calorimeters.

6
00:00:29.925 --> 00:00:32.940
Because of this the muon systems stands

7
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.000
at the end of the calorimeter and at the end of the detector.

8
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.525
The muon system consists of several layers of muon chambers.

9
00:00:42.525 --> 00:00:47.495
A chamber is activated when a muon flies through it.

10
00:00:47.495 --> 00:00:50.460
You already know that tracks of

11
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.340
all charged particles are recognized in the tracking system.

12
00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.420
A particle track is extrapolated to

13
00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.450
the muon system and if the track passes through active muon chambers,

14
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.760
the particle is considered as muon.

15
00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.925
That is the muon identification.

16
00:01:09.925 --> 00:01:13.085
Consider how the muon chambers work.

17
00:01:13.085 --> 00:01:16.890
A muon chamber is some kind of tube,

18
00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.740
and this tube is filled with gas and has a wire inside it.

19
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.525
Also, voltage is applied between the wire and the chamber walls.

20
00:01:28.525 --> 00:01:30.880
When the muon pass through the chamber,

21
00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.910
it ionizes atoms of the gas.

22
00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:41.070
During the ionization process there are ions and electrons are generated in the chamber.

23
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.610
Due to the electromagnetic field inside the chamber,

24
00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.700
the ions go to the cathode and the electrons go to the anode.

25
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.830
This produces electric current and creates

26
00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.905
signal in the chamber that detects the muon.

27
00:01:57.905 --> 00:02:02.020
Similar principle is used in tracking systems.

28
00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.135
Large tracking systems consists of straw tubes filled with gas.

29
00:02:07.135 --> 00:02:14.685
These tubes detect charged particles based on the gas ionization by these particles.

30
00:02:14.685 --> 00:02:17.550
Consider structure of the muon system.

31
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:27.090
The muon system consists of several successive layers of the muon chambers and metal.

32
00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:35.130
The goal of the chambers is to detect muons and the metal tries to stop muons.

33
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.550
The distance that a muon fly in the system,

34
00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.495
allows to estimate energy range of the muon.

35
00:02:42.495 --> 00:02:49.925
Muon system is the largest and the heaviest part of detectors in high energy physics.

36
00:02:49.925 --> 00:02:57.610
It contains a lot of metal to provide required precision of muons energy estimation.

37
00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.440
Despite this, the most energy particles

38
00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.775
pass through the muon system and fly away from the detector.

39
00:03:05.775 --> 00:03:11.205
Further in this video we will see several examples of muon systems.

40
00:03:11.205 --> 00:03:13.390
In the LHCb detector model,

41
00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:19.605
the muon system responses are represented as green bricks.

42
00:03:19.605 --> 00:03:25.420
Each of these bricks represents a muon chamber in the system.

43
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.025
To identify that a particle is a muon,

44
00:03:29.025 --> 00:03:33.525
track of this particle is extrapolated into the muon system.

45
00:03:33.525 --> 00:03:37.750
If there are active chambers correspond to the track,

46
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:43.865
the particle associated with this track is considered as a muon.

47
00:03:43.865 --> 00:03:52.115
There are only two muons on the slide and their tracks are showing by the green lines.

48
00:03:52.115 --> 00:03:56.535
Also, notice that a chamber size is quite large

49
00:03:56.535 --> 00:04:02.435
and there are sets of active chambers that do not correspond to muons.

50
00:04:02.435 --> 00:04:08.575
Machine learning approaches can help to recognize active chambers for track and

51
00:04:08.575 --> 00:04:12.020
separates them from noise chambers and as

52
00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:15.875
a result improve quality of the muon intensification.

53
00:04:15.875 --> 00:04:20.935
As it was the last system that we talk on this week

54
00:04:20.935 --> 00:04:27.315
and let's make a brief summary of the systems considered in the previous videos.

55
00:04:27.315 --> 00:04:30.210
This week, we considered several the

56
00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.280
most common detector systems in high energy physics.

57
00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.359
These systems are tracking system,

58
00:04:37.359 --> 00:04:43.390
ring-imaging Cherenkov detector, electromagnetic and hadron calorimeters and muon system.

59
00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:47.000
All the systems, recognize particles,

60
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.845
measure their energy and momentum and identify it types.

61
00:04:51.845 --> 00:04:56.460
There are several types of particles flying in the detectors.

62
00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:01.180
All charged particles have responses in the tracking system,

63
00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:07.080
that reconstructs their tracks and measures their momentum values.

64
00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:16.435
Ring-imaging Cherenkov detector identifies a particle type based on its track and momentum.

65
00:05:16.435 --> 00:05:20.095
Electrons and photons are stopped by

66
00:05:20.095 --> 00:05:25.365
the electromagnetic calorimeter that also measures their energies.

67
00:05:25.365 --> 00:05:29.970
Other particles fly further to the hadron calorimeter.

68
00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:33.510
Hadron calorimeter stops protons, neutrons,

69
00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:38.730
and other particles containing quarks and measures their energy.

70
00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:42.585
There are only muon chambers after

71
00:05:42.585 --> 00:05:47.875
the hadron calorimeter due to muons pass all detector systems.

72
00:05:47.875 --> 00:05:53.265
Different particle types have different responses in the detector systems,

73
00:05:53.265 --> 00:05:59.000
and these responses allow to identify the particle types.

74
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.910
In the next video, we will see how machine learning can be

75
00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:07.290
used for the particle identification based on these responses.

76
00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:13.485
At the end to this video consider several examples of the detector compositions.

77
00:06:13.485 --> 00:06:15.750
The LHCb detector is

78
00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:22.555
a single-arm forward spectrometer which registers particles flying in one direction.

79
00:06:22.555 --> 00:06:28.830
In this figure, particles fly from left to right.

80
00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:33.255
So, the first detector systems are the tracking systems,

81
00:06:33.255 --> 00:06:37.480
and the RICH detectors shown on the left.

82
00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:42.440
After them the electromagnetic and hadron calorimeter are located.

83
00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:47.310
Finally, there is the muon system at the end of the detector.

84
00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:51.585
Particle tracks are shown by different colored lines.

85
00:06:51.585 --> 00:06:56.820
Notice that almost all particles are stopped into calorimeters,

86
00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:03.135
and only a muon shown as green line, flies further.

87
00:07:03.135 --> 00:07:07.800
The second example is the CMS detector.

88
00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:13.115
It has a cylindrical shape and registers particles in all direction.

89
00:07:13.115 --> 00:07:17.195
The figures shows transfer section of the detector.

90
00:07:17.195 --> 00:07:21.960
All the systems allocated successfully out of the center.

91
00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:27.895
Sequence of systems is the same as for the LHCb detector.

92
00:07:27.895 --> 00:07:33.270
Firstly, there is the tracking system in uniform magnetic field.

93
00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:38.940
Due to the magnetic field, tracks of charged particles such as muons,

94
00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:42.255
pions and electrons have circle shape.

95
00:07:42.255 --> 00:07:46.395
Radius of the tracks allows to estimate the particle momentum.

96
00:07:46.395 --> 00:07:50.505
Neutral particles have no hits in the tracking system.

97
00:07:50.505 --> 00:07:53.875
So, their tracks are not recognized.

98
00:07:53.875 --> 00:07:57.410
However, neutral particles are detected by

99
00:07:57.410 --> 00:08:00.840
the calorimeters located after the tracking system.

100
00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:06.570
Muons pass through the calorimeters and are detected by the muon chambers.

101
00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:11.235
Notice that the muon system is the largest part of the detector.

102
00:08:11.235 --> 00:08:15.045
In the next video, we will consider how to use responses

103
00:08:15.045 --> 00:08:20.490
from all of these detector systems for the particle type identification.
