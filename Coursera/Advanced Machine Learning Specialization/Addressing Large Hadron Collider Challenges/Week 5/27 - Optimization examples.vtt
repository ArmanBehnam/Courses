00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:07.700
In this video, we consider two examples of usage the

2
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:13.840
Bayesian optimization with Gaussian processes in real high energy physics experiments.

3
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.335
The first example is a muon shield optimization,

4
00:00:17.335 --> 00:00:19.810
is the SHiP experiment at CERN.

5
00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:26.100
The SHiP experiment is a new general purpose fixed target facility proposed at

6
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.780
the CERN SPS accelerator to search for new physics in

7
00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:36.085
the largely explored domain of very weakly interacting particles.

8
00:00:36.085 --> 00:00:41.100
The moun shield is a critical component of the SHiP experiment,

9
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.275
which deflects the high flux of muons produced in the target,

10
00:00:46.275 --> 00:00:51.775
that would represent a very serious background for the particles searches,

11
00:00:51.775 --> 00:00:53.555
away from the detector.

12
00:00:53.555 --> 00:00:59.735
The shield consist of eight magnets and each magnet is parameterized by seven values.

13
00:00:59.735 --> 00:01:06.115
The loss function depends on the physical performance of the shield and its weight.

14
00:01:06.115 --> 00:01:10.875
So, it is a 42-dimensional optimization problem and

15
00:01:10.875 --> 00:01:16.305
optimal moun shield geometry was found using 5000 iterations,

16
00:01:16.305 --> 00:01:19.555
using the Bayesian optimization with Gaussian processes.

17
00:01:19.555 --> 00:01:23.445
The optimal geometry of the shield is shown on the slide.

18
00:01:23.445 --> 00:01:30.175
It's 25 percent lighter and as a result 25 percent cheaper.

19
00:01:30.175 --> 00:01:34.385
Next example is about collisions simulation optimization.

20
00:01:34.385 --> 00:01:40.420
Bayesian methods are used to optimize parameters of heavy-ion collision simulation.

21
00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.100
Evaluating a simulation model for a single set of

22
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.000
parameters requires thousands of individual event simulations,

23
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.540
so direct optimization techniques,

24
00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.050
like grid search, quickly become intractable.

25
00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.635
This slide just shows simulated examples of

26
00:01:59.635 --> 00:02:03.150
entropy density in the transverse plane for several,

27
00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.230
typical ion-ion collision events.

28
00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:14.080
With optimization, 300 initial points were generated in nine-dimensional parameter space.

29
00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.805
These parameters are listed in the table on the slide.

30
00:02:17.805 --> 00:02:21.095
For each of these 300 points,

31
00:02:21.095 --> 00:02:26.035
about 10,000 of events were executed.

32
00:02:26.035 --> 00:02:33.450
Figure on this slide demonstrates validation of Gaussian process emulator predictions.

33
00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:39.270
Each panel shows predictions compared to explicit model calculations,

34
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.140
at a 50 validation design points.

35
00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:49.245
This figure shows the quality of the simulation models with the optimal parameters.

36
00:02:49.245 --> 00:02:53.805
Lines correspond to different simulation models with optimal parameters.

37
00:02:53.805 --> 00:02:57.335
Points are data from the ALICE experiment.

38
00:02:57.335 --> 00:03:02.030
In the bottom, it's a ratio of model calculations to data,

39
00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.035
where the gray band indicates +/- 10 percent.

40
00:03:06.035 --> 00:03:10.000
In this video, we considered that just several examples of using

41
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.265
Bayesian optimization methods in high energy physics.

42
00:03:14.265 --> 00:03:17.195
In the programming assignment for this week,

43
00:03:17.195 --> 00:03:23.170
you will be able to find optimal design for a simple tracking system.
