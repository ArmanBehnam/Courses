00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:05.640
Hello. On this week,

2
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.525
we will talk about detector design optimization in high energy physics experiments.

3
00:00:11.525 --> 00:00:17.100
But firstly, let's consider why the design optimization is so important.

4
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.760
From the previous weeks,

5
00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.700
we have learned that the detectors in

6
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.725
high energy physics experiments are sophisticated and expensive.

7
00:00:25.725 --> 00:00:30.030
These detectors consist of different parts: tracking system,

8
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.085
Ring Image Cherenkov detector,

9
00:00:32.085 --> 00:00:36.005
electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters, and muon system.

10
00:00:36.005 --> 00:00:39.515
Each of these parts have thousands of sensors,

11
00:00:39.515 --> 00:00:44.250
which register particles, and measure their momentum and energy.

12
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.570
Layout of these sensors affects precision,

13
00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.465
efficiency, and cost of these detectors.

14
00:00:50.465 --> 00:00:53.155
Let's consider several examples.

15
00:00:53.155 --> 00:00:56.950
The first example is the LHCb detector.

16
00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:03.650
This is forward-arm detector and registers particles flying only in one direction.

17
00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.425
In this example, particles fly from left to right,

18
00:01:08.425 --> 00:01:12.930
and size of the detector systems also increases in same direction.

19
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:19.045
This solution allows to detect as much particles as possible,

20
00:01:19.045 --> 00:01:22.070
and reduce the detector cost.

21
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.830
The second example is the CMS detector at CERN.

22
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.455
This is a cilindrical detector and registers particles in all directions.

23
00:01:31.455 --> 00:01:34.280
Let's consider a cross-section of this detector.

24
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:40.015
This slide shows location and size of different systems of the detector.

25
00:01:40.015 --> 00:01:44.730
For example, there are twelve layers in the tracking system.

26
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.615
But why not five or 20?

27
00:01:47.615 --> 00:01:55.895
How to choose the optimal number or why there are only four layers of the muon chambers?

28
00:01:55.895 --> 00:01:58.110
Probably, it's possible to provide

29
00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.205
the same detector performance with smaller number of layers.

30
00:02:02.205 --> 00:02:06.045
One more example is the ATLAS detector at CERN.

31
00:02:06.045 --> 00:02:10.260
It has similar structure as the CMS detector.

32
00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:15.280
This slide shows just overview of the detector.

33
00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.425
And if you look closer,

34
00:02:17.425 --> 00:02:25.025
you will find two persons in the figure that help to estimate the detector size.

35
00:02:25.025 --> 00:02:27.360
But, in this example,

36
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.260
we will only consider the ATLAS inner tracking system.

37
00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.605
The ATLAS inner tracking system consists of

38
00:02:35.605 --> 00:02:38.840
three different parts of different sensor types.

39
00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.165
The system consists of three different parts with different sensor types.

40
00:02:44.165 --> 00:02:48.815
The most inner part has three layers of silicon pixel sensors.

41
00:02:48.815 --> 00:02:53.860
These sensors provide the highest precision of particle track reconstruction.

42
00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:59.665
The middle of this system has four layers of the silicon strip sensors.

43
00:02:59.665 --> 00:03:03.995
And the outer part consists of drift straw tubes.

44
00:03:03.995 --> 00:03:09.725
How can we estimate the number of layers and their locations in the system?

45
00:03:09.725 --> 00:03:15.040
On these questions, we will try to find answers on this week.

46
00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.790
Now, let's consider the detector optimization workflow.

47
00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.570
The goal of the detector optimization is to

48
00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.000
find optimal layout of sensors in the detector.

49
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.160
To do this, an objective function for the optimization must be defined.

50
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:36.075
This function aggregates key values needed to be optimized: cost of the detector,

51
00:03:36.075 --> 00:03:39.140
track resolution, track reconstruction efficiency,

52
00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.250
precision of the momentum and efficiency reconstruction, and so on.

53
00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.090
Then, a set of parameters that define the sensor layout

54
00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.505
and affect the objective function values must be selected.

55
00:03:52.505 --> 00:03:55.390
And finally, search for the parameters

56
00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.985
values correspond to the optimum of the objective function.

57
00:03:58.985 --> 00:04:02.640
For an example, consider a simple tracking system.

58
00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.190
The goal of this example is to find optimal geometry of the system.

59
00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:12.685
And this geometry can be defined by the set of shifts between the layers.

60
00:04:12.685 --> 00:04:17.920
A possible objective function is the number of hits per one track.

61
00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.935
In your programming assignment for this week,

62
00:04:20.935 --> 00:04:25.090
you will be able to find optimal geometry for this tracking system.

63
00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:30.810
More difficult example is the muon shield optimization in the SHiP experiment at CERN.

64
00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.740
The goal of the shield is to deflect as much muons as possible.

65
00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.390
The shield consist of eight magnets,

66
00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:42.640
and each magnet is parameterized by seven values.

67
00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.460
So, there are 42 parameters to optimize.

68
00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:53.895
The objective function depends on the physical performance of the shield and its weight.

69
00:04:53.895 --> 00:04:59.160
We will consider how the shield was optimized in the next videos.

70
00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:05.065
But, which methods can be used for the detector design optimization?

71
00:05:05.065 --> 00:05:09.870
One of the most popular and the simplest method is grid search.

72
00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.225
It defines a grid of the parameter values and

73
00:05:13.225 --> 00:05:18.450
calculates the objective function values for each node in the grid.

74
00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:25.430
The node with the highest or least function value is taken as the optimum.

75
00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:28.970
Consider how it works on a 2D example.

76
00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:34.355
In this example, a function with two parameters is optimized.

77
00:05:34.355 --> 00:05:38.685
For this, the parameter values are divided into the grid.

78
00:05:38.685 --> 00:05:44.090
And the node with the highest function value is considered as the optimum.

79
00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:48.545
However, this method has a range of disadvantages.

80
00:05:48.545 --> 00:05:54.240
The first of them is that grid search is reasonable to use when the number of

81
00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.270
parameters is small and the grid size

82
00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:01.370
exponentially grows with number of parameters to optimize.

83
00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:07.070
It became more important when the objective function is expensive to evaluate.

84
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:11.240
Thus, the grid search requires to large computational resources.

85
00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.440
Detectors optimization in high energy physics

86
00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:19.055
requires to run Monte-Carlo simulation of these detectors.

87
00:06:19.055 --> 00:06:25.255
Thus, the optimization in high energy physics requires large computational resources.

88
00:06:25.255 --> 00:06:29.295
On this week, we'll learn about the Bayesian optimization.

89
00:06:29.295 --> 00:06:35.445
Bayesian optimization is a method of finding the optimum of an expensive function.

90
00:06:35.445 --> 00:06:39.430
The goal of the Bayesian optimization is to find the optimum of

91
00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:45.580
the objective function using a small number of function calculations as possible.

92
00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:50.175
But before we'll talk about the Bayesian optimization,

93
00:06:50.175 --> 00:06:52.600
I do like to remind you key properties of

94
00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:58.970
normal distribution and to talk about the Gaussian processes for regression.
