00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:08.850
In this video, I would like to remind you key properties of normal distribution.

2
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.315
This will be needed in the next videos.

3
00:00:11.315 --> 00:00:16.630
The normal or Gaussian distribution is a continuous probability distribution.

4
00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.675
The probability density in

5
00:00:19.675 --> 00:00:24.180
one dimensional case is defined by the equation shown on the slide.

6
00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.540
In this equation, x is the random value,

7
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.085
Mu is the mean of the distribution,

8
00:00:30.085 --> 00:00:35.710
and sigma squared is the variance or just sigma is the standard deviation.

9
00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.700
Examples of normal distribution with zero mean and

10
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.040
different sigmas are shown in the figure on the slide.

11
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.605
Sigma defines width of the distribution.

12
00:00:47.605 --> 00:00:51.700
The larger the sigma value the more wider the distribution.

13
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:57.405
These examples are with the same sigma and three different mean values.

14
00:00:57.405 --> 00:01:02.215
So, mean of the distribution defines position of it.

15
00:01:02.215 --> 00:01:05.010
Let's complicate the distribution.

16
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.710
The multivariate normal or Gaussian distribution is

17
00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:14.060
a generalization of the one-dimensional normal distribution to higher dimensions.

18
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.640
The probability density in N dimensions is defined by

19
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:24.365
the equation of the slide where vector x is a N-dimensional random vector,

20
00:01:24.365 --> 00:01:27.805
Mu is a N-dimensional mean vector,

21
00:01:27.805 --> 00:01:33.810
and sigma is a covariance matrix of the distribution with size N to N.

22
00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.925
This is the same distribution as on

23
00:01:36.925 --> 00:01:40.915
the previous slide but with more details about its parameters.

24
00:01:40.915 --> 00:01:45.670
Mean vector Mu is the mean of input vector x.

25
00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:51.220
And each element of the covariance matrix represents dependency between

26
00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:57.485
two points x_i and x_j as it's shown on the slide.

27
00:01:57.485 --> 00:02:03.340
Consider the 2D example with the following mean vector and the covariance matrix.

28
00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.180
The mean vector defines the position of the center of

29
00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.420
the distribution and the covariance matrix defines its width.

30
00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.345
Covariance matrix also defines shape of the distribution

31
00:02:16.345 --> 00:02:22.055
and its orientation as it's shown on this slide, in this example.

32
00:02:22.055 --> 00:02:24.240
In the next videos,

33
00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.655
we will use properties of conditional distribution.

34
00:02:27.655 --> 00:02:31.730
Consider the multivariate normal distribution shown on the slide.

35
00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.240
Suppose that the input vector consists of the two vectors,

36
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:43.740
x_a and x_b, with size k and N minus k, respectively.

37
00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:50.000
Also, suppose that the Mu vector also consists of the two vectors,

38
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.460
and the covariance matrix has the following structure shown on the slide where

39
00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:59.275
each element of these matrix is also a matrix.

40
00:02:59.275 --> 00:03:03.370
In this case, the conditional distribution is normal that

41
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.350
it defines by its mean vector and the covariance matrix.

42
00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.185
They are estimated by the equations shown on the slide.

43
00:03:11.185 --> 00:03:14.340
One more property we need is that

44
00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.535
the marginal distribution of the normal distribution is also normal.

45
00:03:18.535 --> 00:03:22.680
And its parameters estimated as it's shown on the slide.

46
00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.900
All these properties of the normal distribution,

47
00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.150
we will use in the next video about Gaussian processes for regression.
