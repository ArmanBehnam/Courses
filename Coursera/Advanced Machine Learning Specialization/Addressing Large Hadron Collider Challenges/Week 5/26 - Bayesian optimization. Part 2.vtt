00:00:03.793 --> 00:00:08.336
In this video, we will talk about
the exploration-exploitation trade-off of

3
00:00:08.336 --> 00:00:10.430
the Bayesian optimization.

4
00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:15.560
But firstly, let me remind you key
points about the Bayesian optimization.

5
00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:20.600
So the Bayesian optimization is
a method of finding the optimum

6
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.490
of expensive cost functions.

7
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.170
This cost function is also called
objective function and denoted as f.

8
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.810
It supposed that calculation of
f at one point is expensive.

9
00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.840
And the derivatives of these
functions are unknown.

10
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.040
The goal of Bayesian optimization is to
find the optimum of the objective function

11
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:50.280
using as small number of the function
calculations as possible.

12
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.950
The optimization algorithm is follow.

13
00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.946
And the first step finds the objective
function approximation using previously

14
00:00:56.946 --> 00:01:00.490
calculated values, and
solving the regression problem.

15
00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:06.770
Then using the approximation find optimum
point of an acquisition function.

16
00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.650
Then, after that, sample the objective
function in this new point,

17
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.950
and repeat all the steps.

18
00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.080
There are variety of acquisition
functions, and one of them used in this

19
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:27.040
video is Lower Confidence Bound for
the object function minimization.

20
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.970
The Bayesian optimization with Gaussian
processes allows to balance between

21
00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.290
exploration and
exploitation of the objective function.

22
00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.930
Exploration is when you choose a point

23
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.640
with high variance at each
iteration of the optimization.

24
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.970
And exploitation,
it's when you choose a point with high or

25
00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.950
low mean at each iteration
of the optimization.

26
00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.260
Adjustable parameters of
the acquisition functions

27
00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.859
provide trade-off between exploration and
exploitation.

28
00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.210
To study the exploration-exploitation
properties of the Bayesian optimization,

29
00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.580
consider the following
objective function f.

30
00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.540
The goal in this example
is to find its minimum.

31
00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.829
Let's start the optimization
from three observations.

32
00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.420
Firstly, consider
the exploitation property.

33
00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:27.120
Exploitation can be achieved
with a small values of k

34
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.210
parameter in lower
confidence bound function.

35
00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.932
After ten iterations, we have almost
all observations in the local minimum.

36
00:02:36.932 --> 00:02:42.175
And there are just few observations
in other regions of the function.

37
00:02:42.175 --> 00:02:47.915
After 20 iterations, we again have almost
all observations in the minima regions,

38
00:02:47.915 --> 00:02:51.920
and there are just few
observations in other regions.

39
00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.500
This is the exploitation property of
the Bayesian optimization with Gaussian

40
00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.010
processes.

41
00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.550
The key features of
the exploitation are follow.

42
00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:07.610
So exploitation takes a new
point at each iteration

43
00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.500
close to found optimum of
the objective function.

44
00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.540
There is no guarantee that
this optimum is global.

45
00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:22.080
Other regions of the objective
function are not explored, and

46
00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:28.780
it needs less iterations that for
exploration to find the optimum.

47
00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.810
Now consider the exploration property
of the Bayesian optimization.

48
00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.260
Exploration can be achieved
with large values of k

49
00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.526
in lower confidence bound function.

50
00:03:40.526 --> 00:03:49.390
In the exploration case all observations
are distributed through the whole region.

51
00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:54.200
The target function is explored
during the Bayesian optimization.

52
00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.890
After twenty iterations,

53
00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.350
all observations are again
distributed through the whole region.

54
00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:04.200
And this is exploration property
of the Bayesian optimization with

55
00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.990
Gaussian processes.

56
00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:12.340
So during the exploration,
it's taken a new point at each iteration

57
00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.550
where the variance of the approximation
of the objective function is large.

58
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.800
All regions of the objective
functions are explored.

59
00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:25.430
It's more likely that
the found optimum is global.

60
00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:31.060
And it needs more iterations than for
exploitation to find the optimum.

61
00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.830
Finally, we have learned
the Bayesian optimization.

62
00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:39.752
Bayesian optimization is a method of
finding the optimum of expensive cost

63
00:04:39.752 --> 00:04:40.620
functions.

64
00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:48.390
We know how it works and how to use
the exploration-exploitation trade-off during the optimization.

65
00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:52.700
In high energy physics, Bayesian
optimization with Gaussian processes

66
00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.930
can be used for
detector design optimization.

67
00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:57.477
In the next video,

68
00:04:57.477 --> 00:05:03.194
we consider two examples of
the optimization in high energy physics.
