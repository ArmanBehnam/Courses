2
00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:09.960
Hello everyone, this week we are going to
continue our experimental physics journey.

3
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.000
The primary focus this time will
be comparison of two hypothesis

4
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.130
through the measurement of
some real-world parameters.

5
00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.630
We'll follow analysis strategy
that LHCb experiment, for

6
00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.210
example, uses for hunting for rare decays.

7
00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.590
We'll see how machine learning can be
used to improve sensitivity of research,

8
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.990
and examine some essential boundary conditions

9
00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:39.220
that restrict the use of
an arbitrary predictive model.

10
00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.230
One of the most extraordinary scientists
of all the times, Richard Feynman.

11
00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:49.630
I hope you've already had a chance to
appreciate his way of transforming

12
00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:54.650
doodles into a powerful
communication tool find on diagrams.

13
00:00:54.650 --> 00:01:00.640
He used to say that present situation
in physics as if we know chess,

14
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.660
but we don't know one or two rules.

15
00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.020
In fact,
the situation is a bit more complicated.

16
00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:14.420
Now, we understand that there are a whole
lot of things going on with dark matter

17
00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:20.960
and dark energy, and we don't have a clue
how many rules we are actually missing.

18
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.510
However, as long as we're talking
about chess as a metaphor for

19
00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.460
a scientific research,
it works quite nice.

20
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.450
We have to play various games
scenarios to figure out what

21
00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:39.220
kind of rules apply to our figures.

22
00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:45.110
In our case, instead of chess figures,
we have standard model particles.

23
00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.710
Just let's recap.

24
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.710
The standard model of particle physics
describes what universe is made of,

25
00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.990
and how it holds together.

26
00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.710
It rests on two central ideas.

27
00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.970
The first one,
all matter is made of particles,

28
00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.340
and these particles
interact with each other

29
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.818
by exchanging other particles
associated with fundamental forces.

30
00:02:09.818 --> 00:02:13.393
The essential grains of
matter are fermions,

31
00:02:13.393 --> 00:02:16.530
and the force carriers are bosons.

32
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:22.360
Fermions are represented by quarks,
building blocks that stick together,

33
00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.530
and form higher order of matter
like neutrons and protons.

34
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:35.010
And leptons that are thought of as
a fundamental independent bits of matter.

35
00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.450
If you consider a decay like one
we've looked at the first lecture,

36
00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.360
a decay of a muon into
an electron neutrino and

37
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.340
antineutrino, you can count
specific numbers like mass,

38
00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.580
charge, on the left and
on the right part of the equation.

39
00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.020
There is also a quantum number
that is called lepton charge,

40
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.520
or lepton number, which is representing
the difference between the number

41
00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:11.790
of leptons and number of anti-leptons
in an elementary particle reaction.

42
00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.820
So, on the left and
on the right part of the equation,

43
00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.830
you have this difference equal to one.

44
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.140
Let's introduce one more quantity.

45
00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.570
Every matter of particle occupies
a particular column in the table,

46
00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.920
you see on the screen,
it is called generation.

47
00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.610
So electron belongs to
the first generation, and

48
00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.170
muon belongs to the second generation.

49
00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.590
So for every decay we can count the number
of leptons of the first generation,

50
00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.720
of the second generation,
and of the third generation.

51
00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:51.140
So we have a tuple of free elements
that is called lepton flavor.

52
00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.656
Let's remember it for a minute and

53
00:03:53.656 --> 00:03:57.732
it we'll come back to that
factor in a couple of slides,

54
00:03:57.732 --> 00:04:03.304
we know that standard model although
quite powerful, it is not all mighty.

55
00:04:03.304 --> 00:04:07.500
There is no gravity,
no dark matter particles, etc.

56
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.679
There are alternative models like
I've mentioned in the first lecture,

57
00:04:12.679 --> 00:04:16.390
extra dimension model,
or micro black holes.

58
00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:24.980
Among those there is a real princess of such models
called super symmetry, or SUSY for short.

59
00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:30.220
It assumes the existence of
super particles symmetrical

60
00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.990
to all particle of standard model,
you can see it on the slide.

61
00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:42.277
There was quite a bit of hope to
discover at least some of those at LHC.

62
00:04:42.277 --> 00:04:47.109
Introduction of those super
partners could explain various

63
00:04:47.109 --> 00:04:50.906
things we have no
reasonable explanation for.

64
00:04:50.906 --> 00:04:54.000
Dark matter phenomena for example.

65
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.370
Another thing, introduction of
this method is unification of

66
00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:04.800
all the forces that suppose to
happen at specific energy level.

67
00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.770
So, if we want to compare
to different models.

68
00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:16.808
So we have our basic model or,
standard model in our case or,

69
00:05:16.808 --> 00:05:21.300
or a null hypothesis, and
we have an alternative model hypothesis X.

70
00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:27.040
That, for example, explains some unknown
phenomena, and at the same time, this

71
00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:32.900
alternative model has different prediction
for specific measurable quantity.

72
00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:37.380
For example, a branch inflation will
explain what it is a little bit later

73
00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:41.510
in the next slide for specific decay D.

74
00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:46.940
So we can estimate theoretical
predictions of standard model and

75
00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:50.960
of theory X for this quantity.

76
00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.060
Let them call BSM and BX.

77
00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:59.590
So, we make an experimental observation
of D and measure the actual value for

78
00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:05.120
the quantity B observable, and
we measure some uncertainty, sigma.

79
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:12.750
So, if this value that we measure in
the experiment is too far from BSM,

80
00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:17.390
and close to the prediction of alternative
model, hail to the alternative model.

81
00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:23.820
If it is too far from prediction of the
alternative model, we can forget about it.

82
00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:26.410
Otherwise, we wait for more data.

83
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:32.260
And here, by the distance,
we mean the for example P value.

84
00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:36.883
So by convention of particle
physics if a measured

85
00:06:36.883 --> 00:06:41.725
quantity sits outside of
five sigma interval, so,

86
00:06:41.725 --> 00:06:46.237
which has probability of
random equation is less

87
00:06:46.237 --> 00:06:50.528
than decimal number,
then the prediction and

88
00:06:50.528 --> 00:06:55.720
then the absorbed value is
considered to be far enough.

89
00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:59.520
So, as for branching fraction.

90
00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:05.140
So, we can consider all different types
of the decay that happen with certain

91
00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:10.620
kind of particles, for example, a Tau
particle can decay into different modes.

92
00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:12.778
So here, you see some examples.

93
00:07:12.778 --> 00:07:18.398
So, and there are different probabilities
for those modes, for example for

94
00:07:18.398 --> 00:07:23.860
electron and electron antineutrino,
the probability is rougly 17%.

95
00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:30.384
For muon and muon antineutrino is 70%,,
it will look less, etc.

96
00:07:30.384 --> 00:07:35.960
And if you want to know all possible decay
outcomes, or so called final states,

97
00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:40.873
you can follow the link that leads to
one of the most important resource

98
00:07:40.873 --> 00:07:45.140
in particle physics,
which is called particle data group.

99
00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:50.891
That has all measure
decays of Tau particle.

100
00:07:50.891 --> 00:07:56.283
