2
00:00:03.754 --> 00:00:06.118
So that's just the critic.

3
00:00:06.118 --> 00:00:11.407
That's just the probability
a that with which probability

4
00:00:11.407 --> 00:00:15.857
will accept and move proposed by Markov.

5
00:00:15.857 --> 00:00:19.730
And that's just in the way
the detail equation holds.

6
00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:25.041
So here we have the desired distribution,
pi, which we want to sample from.

7
00:00:25.041 --> 00:00:29.541
And we have the Markov chain Q,
which we want to fix by a critic A.

8
00:00:29.541 --> 00:00:34.037
And we want to fix this A such that
this [INAUDIBLE] equation holds.

9
00:00:34.037 --> 00:00:39.296
So pi is indeed a stationary distribution
for the mark of chain T, and

10
00:00:39.296 --> 00:00:45.024
that's the mark of chain T converge to
this point from any starting point.

11
00:00:45.024 --> 00:00:47.920
So let's see how we can choose
A such that this property holds.

12
00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:54.356
Let's, compose

13
00:00:54.356 --> 00:00:59.650
this equality and, move all the parts
that depends on A in one part.

14
00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:06.466
So, A(x to x'),

15
00:01:09.067 --> 00:01:12.877
Divided by A(x' to x),

16
00:01:17.508 --> 00:01:20.103
Equals to the following equation,
so we have

17
00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.389
On the one side we have Y of X prime.

18
00:01:30.123 --> 00:01:33.310
And the Q of X prime to x, and

19
00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.443
in the denominator we
have the same thing but

20
00:01:38.443 --> 00:01:41.790
With swapping x and x prime.

21
00:01:44.168 --> 00:01:50.047
[SOUND] So,
this is something computable right?

22
00:01:50.047 --> 00:01:51.903
We know y and q.

23
00:01:51.903 --> 00:01:54.016
So, we can compute this thing for
any two values.

24
00:01:54.016 --> 00:01:56.171
Let's call this, ratio raw.

25
00:01:59.014 --> 00:02:03.642
Let's assume for
a moment that this row is less than 1.

26
00:02:03.642 --> 00:02:07.522
So it's always greater than 0 because
it's some ratio of probabilities.

27
00:02:07.522 --> 00:02:14.239
But let's assume that
it's also less than 1.

28
00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:17.300
So it's just an assumption, it may
not hold too much, let's assume that.

29
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.817
In this case, we have a ratio of eights,

30
00:02:19.817 --> 00:02:23.382
which would make equal to
which is less than one.

31
00:02:23.382 --> 00:02:28.493
So let's just use A of
x prime to be your one

32
00:02:33.038 --> 00:02:35.194
And A ox X prime to X to be 1.

33
00:02:41.933 --> 00:02:46.017
This way the desire to holds true right,

34
00:02:46.017 --> 00:02:51.408
because A of X to X prime divided to
X prime to X Will be [INAUDIBLE].

35
00:02:51.408 --> 00:02:56.807
And what you may notice that we could
have chosen here some other numbers,

36
00:02:56.807 --> 00:03:01.002
like 4 divided by 2, for
example, or 1 divided by 2.

37
00:03:01.002 --> 00:03:02.682
But this will also work,

38
00:03:02.682 --> 00:03:07.018
the overall mark of chain will
deconverge to the distribution.

39
00:03:07.018 --> 00:03:08.930
[INAUDIBLE].

40
00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.591
Because this I think is
the probability we accepts they move.

41
00:03:13.591 --> 00:03:17.868
And the way to increase probability
will necessarily inject more moves.

42
00:03:17.868 --> 00:03:23.417
So we risk more capacity for
our more [INAUDIBLE] which will reject.

43
00:03:23.417 --> 00:03:28.399
So this choose is the maximum
acceptance probability we

44
00:03:28.399 --> 00:03:32.321
can make while keeping
the ratio to be low And

45
00:03:32.321 --> 00:03:36.146
what to do if the ratio
is greater than one.

46
00:03:36.146 --> 00:03:39.398
Well we can just choose
to be A of X prime,

47
00:03:39.398 --> 00:03:43.727
X to X prime to be divided by one,
and this P to be one N.

48
00:03:43.727 --> 00:03:48.665
So we can summarize this
to cases that are always

49
00:03:48.665 --> 00:03:54.097
less than one and
they're always greater than one,

50
00:03:54.097 --> 00:03:58.417
in the form of
the expression A of X prime,

51
00:03:58.417 --> 00:04:04.818
of X dot prime, To be equal to minimal.

52
00:04:07.247 --> 00:04:12.857
Within two values, 1 and this ratio,

53
00:04:12.857 --> 00:04:18.467
so and
pie of X prime times Q of X prime dot

54
00:04:18.467 --> 00:04:28.021
X And

55
00:04:28.021 --> 00:04:33.252
the same thing while changing the
parameters x to x prime and vice versa.

56
00:04:40.295 --> 00:04:42.940
So this expression works both for

57
00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:48.044
the case where the ratio is less
than than 1 and greater than 1.

58
00:04:48.044 --> 00:04:51.633
You can check it by considering two cases.

59
00:04:51.633 --> 00:04:54.907
And in one case it will
be just 1 because it's.

60
00:04:54.907 --> 00:04:58.335
Minimum between 1 and
something greater than 1.

61
00:04:58.335 --> 00:05:01.447
In other case it will be wrong.

62
00:05:01.447 --> 00:05:10.040
So this and by choosing this critic we
indeed can prove that the overall mark of

63
00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:15.169
defined by this kind of
procedure will indeed.

64
00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:18.070
Follow this equation.

65
00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:22.457
So the distribution probably will be
stationary for our Markov chain, and

66
00:05:22.457 --> 00:05:27.065
that we will convert to distribution for
any starting point.

67
00:05:27.065 --> 00:05:33.811
Last, by choosing this critic,
we may sample from the distribution y.

68
00:05:33.811 --> 00:05:38.724
To summarise the metropolis
Hastings approach to building

69
00:05:38.724 --> 00:05:43.251
chain that converges to
the desired distribution pi.

70
00:05:43.251 --> 00:05:48.127
We have to start with sum of mac chain q,
which we don't have anything to

71
00:05:48.127 --> 00:05:53.004
do with the distribution pie and
then this mark of chain on each step will

72
00:05:53.004 --> 00:05:58.321
propose symbols and we'll have a correct
with sometimes rejects this move.

73
00:05:58.321 --> 00:06:01.922
And ask the mark of chain to stay
where it was at the various straight.

74
00:06:01.922 --> 00:06:06.807
And we just proved that if you
defined your coreject to be like this,

75
00:06:06.807 --> 00:06:12.294
if your acceptance from bill will be
this expression minimum between one and

76
00:06:12.294 --> 00:06:13.252
some ratio.

77
00:06:13.252 --> 00:06:17.885
Then no matter from which
Markov chain Q is started with,

78
00:06:17.885 --> 00:06:23.106
you will necessarily converge
to the desired distribution pi.

79
00:06:23.106 --> 00:06:26.954
Note that this acceptance probability,
it's the only place

80
00:06:26.954 --> 00:06:30.951
where we use our distribution pi,
which we want to sample from.

81
00:06:30.951 --> 00:06:35.700
And note that we don't have to
know this distribution pi exactly.

82
00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:38.422
We may know it up to
normalization constant.

83
00:06:38.422 --> 00:06:43.337
because here, we'll have a ratio between
our distribution at two different points.

84
00:06:43.337 --> 00:06:46.816
It doesn't matter how we
normalize this distribution.

85
00:06:46.816 --> 00:06:49.997
The ratio will not care
about the normalization,

86
00:06:49.997 --> 00:06:52.798
because if we divide
each of the parts of this

87
00:06:52.798 --> 00:06:56.826
ratio by the normalization constant z,
nothing will change.

88
00:06:56.826 --> 00:07:02.022
So, this method, as well as
the Gibbs sampling, can be used when

89
00:07:02.022 --> 00:07:07.412
you don't know the normalization
constant of your distribution.

90
00:07:07.412 --> 00:07:13.210
We have discussed that we can choose q to
be anything in distribution number one.

91
00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:16.876
Well obviously,
the Q should be nonzero anywhere, so

92
00:07:16.876 --> 00:07:19.199
the ratio will be well-defined.

93
00:07:19.199 --> 00:07:21.947
But of course, the efficiency and

94
00:07:21.947 --> 00:07:27.082
the properties of your algorithm
will depend on the choice of Q.

95
00:07:27.082 --> 00:07:29.120
There are kind of two
opposing forces here.

96
00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:33.234
So first of all,
Q should make large steps,

97
00:07:33.234 --> 00:07:39.242
it should spread out and
kind of roll freely in the sample space,

98
00:07:39.242 --> 00:07:44.933
to make the samples less correlated and
to converge faster.

99
00:07:44.933 --> 00:07:50.636
On the other hand, if you have too large
steps, your critic will reject them, too

100
00:07:50.636 --> 00:07:56.354
often, and you will waste your capacity by
staying at the same place for too long.

101
00:07:56.354 --> 00:08:00.297
Because if you're now, for
example, already converged, and

102
00:08:00.297 --> 00:08:05.262
you're in the high-density region,
then if you're Q proposes all this to make

103
00:08:05.262 --> 00:08:10.008
too-large moves, then you will move
outside your high density region, and

104
00:08:10.008 --> 00:08:12.513
the will not be happy with that.

105
00:08:12.513 --> 00:08:18.428
It will say I don't want to go there,
the probability distribution

106
00:08:18.428 --> 00:08:23.326
curve ball doesn't work,
isn't high in that region.

107
00:08:23.326 --> 00:08:24.640
So in the next video,

108
00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:29.611
we'll see some small demo of how this
approach can work in One dimensional case.

109
00:08:29.611 --> 00:08:39.611
