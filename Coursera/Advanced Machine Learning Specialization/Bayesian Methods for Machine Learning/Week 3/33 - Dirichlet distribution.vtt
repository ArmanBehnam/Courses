2
00:00:00.643 --> 00:00:06.175
Before we move on to
the [INAUDIBLE] allocation,

3
00:00:06.175 --> 00:00:11.444
let's see what Dirichlet distribution is.

4
00:00:11.444 --> 00:00:13.935
So it's probability density
function is given as follows.

5
00:00:13.935 --> 00:00:18.834
It is a distribution
over the vector theta.

6
00:00:18.834 --> 00:00:21.926
Its components should solve to 1 and
b non-negative.

7
00:00:21.926 --> 00:00:24.723
This is called a simplex.

8
00:00:24.723 --> 00:00:28.759
A really convenient way to
interpret this is a triangle.

9
00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:32.711
So I have a triangle with three nodes,
they will correspond to

10
00:00:32.711 --> 00:00:37.654
the coordinates (1,0,0),
(0,0,1), and (0,1,0).

11
00:00:37.654 --> 00:00:44.918
And the vector theta will correspond to
the barycentric coordinates of the point.

12
00:00:44.918 --> 00:00:51.888
For example, this red points would have
the coordinance 0.3, 0.1, and 0.5.

13
00:00:51.888 --> 00:00:56.944
Since first and
the third coordinates are large,

14
00:00:56.944 --> 00:01:01.767
this point is near the left and
the upper nodes.

15
00:01:01.767 --> 00:01:07.052
So the distribution is parameterized by
parameter alpha, which is also a vector.

16
00:01:07.052 --> 00:01:11.029
We assume that it's
[INAUDIBLE] non-negative.

17
00:01:11.029 --> 00:01:16.182
The probability density function is
some normalization constant one of over

18
00:01:16.182 --> 00:01:21.109
meta function of alpha times,
a product over coordinates of the vector.

19
00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:26.397
The corresponding coordinate
theta K power alpha k-1.

20
00:01:26.397 --> 00:01:32.097
So by varying the parameter alpha, we can
get different shapes of the distribution.

21
00:01:32.097 --> 00:01:34.773
For example,
if all alphas are less than 1.

22
00:01:34.773 --> 00:01:39.265
We will have some
ball-shaped distribution.

23
00:01:39.265 --> 00:01:43.467
And the most probable positions
would be sparse vectors,

24
00:01:43.467 --> 00:01:48.281
that have one coordinate that is large,
and the others are small.

25
00:01:48.281 --> 00:01:52.997
If on the other hand all
offers are greater than 1,

26
00:01:52.997 --> 00:01:56.407
we will have a unimal distribution.

27
00:01:56.407 --> 00:02:01.390
We can also have different
values of coordinates of alpha.

28
00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:07.238
For example, if alpha is 5, 2, 2,
as shown left, the distribution would be

29
00:02:07.238 --> 00:02:12.573
concentrated around the first node,
that has coordinates 1, 0, 0.

30
00:02:12.573 --> 00:02:16.563
If for
example we have alpha equal to 5, 5, 2,

31
00:02:16.563 --> 00:02:23.310
then the distribution will be concentrated
around the bottom edge of the triangle.

32
00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.674
The statistics of this
distribution are given as follows.

33
00:02:27.674 --> 00:02:32.607
For example, the mean of the expected
value of the coordinate i,

34
00:02:32.607 --> 00:02:37.630
the expected value of theta i,
can be obtained as the ratio between

35
00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.230
corresponding alpha i over
the sum over all values of alpha.

36
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:43.420
This is alpha0.

37
00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.884
And the covariance is given as follows.

38
00:02:46.884 --> 00:02:52.195
Also note that when k is equal to 2,
we get a beta distribution.

39
00:02:52.195 --> 00:02:58.087
So the beta distribution is a case
the Dirichlet distribution,

40
00:02:58.087 --> 00:03:01.261
when we have only two dimensions.

41
00:03:01.261 --> 00:03:02.993
All right, as always,

42
00:03:02.993 --> 00:03:08.118
let's see how we can apply this
distribution in a real world example.

43
00:03:08.118 --> 00:03:12.194
Imagine that you develop an online game,
and

44
00:03:12.194 --> 00:03:15.951
the characters can select the strength,

45
00:03:15.951 --> 00:03:20.472
the stamina, and
the speed of their characters.

46
00:03:20.472 --> 00:03:26.168
So the player has some
credit that equals to 1, and

47
00:03:26.168 --> 00:03:31.743
he can distribute it for
these three criterions.

48
00:03:31.743 --> 00:03:38.557
For example, here,
the player1 assigns more credit for

49
00:03:38.557 --> 00:03:44.405
the strength, and so
his play would be stronger.

50
00:03:44.405 --> 00:03:48.328
However, he compromise for
the stamina and speed.

51
00:03:48.328 --> 00:03:54.306
The second player however,
assigned equal amounts of values for

52
00:03:54.306 --> 00:03:59.319
stamina speed, and
he compromised for the strength.

53
00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:04.590
The third player assigned equal credit for
all three criterions.

54
00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.911
And so if we collect the statistics
over all our players,

55
00:04:08.911 --> 00:04:11.618
we could have something like this.

56
00:04:11.618 --> 00:04:15.642
It is really intuitive to model this
using the Dirichlet distribution.

57
00:04:15.642 --> 00:04:19.830
We could estimate the parameter
alpha from our dataset,

58
00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:23.767
from the statistics that
we gather from the players.

59
00:04:23.767 --> 00:04:27.216
And we can estimate it to be for
example, 3, 1, 1.

60
00:04:27.216 --> 00:04:30.638
This would mean that in your game,

61
00:04:30.638 --> 00:04:36.658
most of the players prefer
stamina over strength and speed.

62
00:04:36.658 --> 00:04:40.528
So actually, there is one more property
that I want to tell you about.

63
00:04:40.528 --> 00:04:47.971
The Dirichlet prior is actually
a conjugate to the multinomial likelihood.

64
00:04:47.971 --> 00:04:52.403
If you don't remember,
let me remind you what conjugate prior is.

65
00:04:52.403 --> 00:04:59.351
So the prior p P of theta is conjugate
to the likelihood P of X given theta.

66
00:04:59.351 --> 00:05:03.901
If the posterior lies in the same
family of distributions as the prior.

67
00:05:03.901 --> 00:05:08.391
So here's our multinomial likelihood.

68
00:05:08.391 --> 00:05:11.805
It equals to some normalization constant

69
00:05:11.805 --> 00:05:16.700
times the product of all coordinates,
theta i, power xi.

70
00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.766
So this is a distribution over counts.

71
00:05:19.766 --> 00:05:23.189
You will have for
example a dice that has six sides.

72
00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:24.509
The key here would be equal to 6.

73
00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:28.588
We will have like six possible outcomes.

74
00:05:28.588 --> 00:05:35.985
And x, for example x1, would be equal
to the number of times we had number 1.

75
00:05:35.985 --> 00:05:43.971
And also n equals to the number of
times that we conducted our experiment.

76
00:05:43.971 --> 00:05:49.151
So actually all x case should sum up to n.

77
00:05:49.151 --> 00:05:51.622
And here is our prior, Dirichlet prior.

78
00:05:51.622 --> 00:05:53.898
We will try to compute the posterior.

79
00:05:53.898 --> 00:05:57.904
We would multiply the likelihood and
the prior.

80
00:05:57.904 --> 00:06:03.124
And so the posterior would be
proportional to the following function.

81
00:06:03.124 --> 00:06:06.730
Product of theta k power alpha k,
plus xk minus 1.

82
00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:13.087
We obtain this formula by rearranging
the terms after multiplication.

83
00:06:13.087 --> 00:06:16.402
And also notice that it has actually
a beta distribution up to a normalization

84
00:06:16.402 --> 00:06:16.912
constant.

85
00:06:16.912 --> 00:06:17.927
All right, so

86
00:06:17.927 --> 00:06:23.264
we can compute the posterior by
multiplying the likelihood and the prior.

87
00:06:23.264 --> 00:06:26.066
If we rearrange the terms,
we'll get the following formula.

88
00:06:26.066 --> 00:06:29.061
This will be the product
over all dimensions.

89
00:06:29.061 --> 00:06:34.464
The probability of the corresponding
dimension power alpha k plus xk minus 1.

90
00:06:34.464 --> 00:06:38.162
Now, hear that it is actually
a Dirichlet distribution,

91
00:06:38.162 --> 00:06:40.280
up to a normalization Gaussian.

92
00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:45.418
And so the posterior is actually
a Dirichlet distribution over theta.

93
00:06:45.418 --> 00:06:49.637
And the vector of parameters would
be obtained as alpha k plus xk,

94
00:06:49.637 --> 00:06:50.875
at each position.

95
00:06:50.875 --> 00:06:54.785
So we just sum up the two vectors.

96
00:06:54.785 --> 00:07:04.785
