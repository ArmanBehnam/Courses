>>In this video, we'll see how to define a probabilistic model.

2
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:13.330
The most convenient way to do this is called the Bayesian Network. It is a graph.

3
00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:18.840
Its nodes are random variables and edges are direct impact.

4
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.495
For example, here we have two random variables,

5
00:00:21.495 --> 00:00:23.745
rain and the fact that the grass is wet.

6
00:00:23.745 --> 00:00:29.130
And these edge shows as if there is rain,

7
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.835
if it's raining, then the grass will be wet for sure.

8
00:00:32.835 --> 00:00:35.310
We can see a more complex graph.

9
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:40.420
For example, here we added another random variable called sprinkler,

10
00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:46.020
and the grass maybe wet either because the sprinkler is working or because it is raining.

11
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.245
Also the sprinkler will not work if there is rain.

12
00:00:49.245 --> 00:00:53.220
From the graph, we can write down the probabilistic model.

13
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:58.265
The probabilistic model is a joint probability over all random variables.

14
00:00:58.265 --> 00:01:00.710
It can be written using the following formula.

15
00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.385
The joint probability over all variables equals to the product for each variable,

16
00:01:05.385 --> 00:01:08.925
is probability given all the parents.

17
00:01:08.925 --> 00:01:11.070
On this graph, for example,

18
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.005
the parents of the node grass are sprinkler and the rain.

19
00:01:16.005 --> 00:01:21.300
Let's try to write down the probabilistic model for this graph.

20
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.825
So the joint probability of sprinkler,

21
00:01:24.825 --> 00:01:29.510
rain, and the grass equals to the product of two terms.

22
00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:34.580
The first one is the probability of grass is worse given the sprinkler and the rain.

23
00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.502
Those are the parents of this node.

24
00:01:36.502 --> 00:01:41.770
Next, multiplier is the probability of the sprinkler given the rain.

25
00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.465
The rain is the only parent of this node.

26
00:01:44.465 --> 00:01:48.170
And finally, we write down the probability of the rain.

27
00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.427
Since this node doesn't have any parents,

28
00:01:51.427 --> 00:01:54.195
we just write down the probability of the rain.

29
00:01:54.195 --> 00:01:57.115
And this is our final model.

30
00:01:57.115 --> 00:01:59.725
We can see a bit more complex ones.

31
00:01:59.725 --> 00:02:02.895
For example, you all know the Naive Bayes classifier.

32
00:02:02.895 --> 00:02:05.165
It's graphical model looks as follows.

33
00:02:05.165 --> 00:02:06.585
We have a class,

34
00:02:06.585 --> 00:02:10.800
C that directly impacts the values of the features,

35
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.890
that is for different classes.

36
00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.655
The distribution of the features may be different.

37
00:02:15.655 --> 00:02:19.970
And the joint distribution can be written using the following formula.

38
00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.091
It is the probability of the class times the product over all features,

39
00:02:25.091 --> 00:02:27.760
the probability of the current feature given the class.

40
00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:35.190
However, this notation is a bit interesting since we have a lot of equal sub-graphs.

41
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:41.670
A bit more convenient way to write down this graph is called a plate notation.

42
00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.240
It is written as follows.

43
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.520
So we have a random variable that corresponds to the class,

44
00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.065
that directly impacts the features.

45
00:02:51.065 --> 00:02:55.605
And this works around this random variable with a number of

46
00:02:55.605 --> 00:02:58.595
repetitions such that we have to repeat this sub-graph

47
00:02:58.595 --> 00:03:02.455
that is contained inside this box and times.

48
00:03:02.455 --> 00:03:05.790
And so this is exactly Kuhn's graphical model,

49
00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.450
the one we saw on the previous slide.
