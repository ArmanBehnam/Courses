00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:08.375
All right, now we're ready to see a real life example.

2
00:00:08.375 --> 00:00:10.850
We've called is a thief an alarm.

3
00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.505
Imagine that you buy an alarm to a house to prevent thief from going into it.

4
00:00:15.505 --> 00:00:18.590
Either the thief goes into a house,

5
00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.035
and the alarm will go off and they will get,

6
00:00:20.035 --> 00:00:23.045
for example, SMS notification.

7
00:00:23.045 --> 00:00:27.890
However, the alarm may give a false alarm in case of an earthquake.

8
00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.205
Also, if there is a strong earthquake,

9
00:00:30.205 --> 00:00:34.830
the radio will report about it and so you get another source of them notification.

10
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.900
Here's a graphical model for it.

11
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.095
What is the general probability of the four and the variables, thief, alarm,

12
00:00:42.095 --> 00:00:46.970
earthquake, and the radio is given by the following formula.

13
00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.246
To fully define our model,

14
00:00:49.246 --> 00:00:52.980
we need to define these four probabilities.

15
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.315
Let's start with thief and earthquake.

16
00:00:56.315 --> 00:00:59.330
What is the probability that there is a thief in our house?

17
00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.335
Let's define it us to 10 to the power of minus three,

18
00:01:02.335 --> 00:01:05.990
that is, one in a thousand houses has been robbed.

19
00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.890
What is the probability of an earthquake?

20
00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.225
Well, Iet's say it is 10 to the power of mines two.

21
00:01:11.225 --> 00:01:15.825
The earthquakes happened about once in 100 days.

22
00:01:15.825 --> 00:01:18.450
Now, we've defined the probability of alarm,

23
00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.205
given the thief as an earthquake so those will be four numbers.

24
00:01:23.205 --> 00:01:24.935
If there is a thief in our house,

25
00:01:24.935 --> 00:01:27.020
the alarm will go for sure.

26
00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.635
This is indicated by the ones in the lower row.

27
00:01:31.635 --> 00:01:34.030
If there is no thief and there is no earthquake,

28
00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.890
then the alarm has no reason to send us signals.

29
00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.725
However, if there is no thief,

30
00:01:39.725 --> 00:01:41.075
but there is an earthquake,

31
00:01:41.075 --> 00:01:44.490
the alarm will notify us for abuse at one time.

32
00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.285
Finally, we need to define the probability of the radio report during an earthquake.

33
00:01:50.285 --> 00:01:51.860
If there is no earthquake,

34
00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.190
the radio reports it has nothing to tell us about,

35
00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.505
and so it will not report about it.

36
00:01:56.505 --> 00:01:58.800
However, if there is an earthquake,

37
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.680
the radio will reports that were permuted one half that is,

38
00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:08.070
it does not report about some small earthquakes.

39
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:11.125
Here's our model again.

40
00:02:11.125 --> 00:02:13.000
I change an additional bit,

41
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.865
so it would be a bit shorter.

42
00:02:14.865 --> 00:02:19.480
For example, instead of writing T=1,

43
00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.712
I would draw it simply T,

44
00:02:21.712 --> 00:02:28.938
and if I want to write down the event that didn't happen for example T=0,

45
00:02:28.938 --> 00:02:30.605
then there is no thief in our house,

46
00:02:30.605 --> 00:02:34.740
I would simply write a bar over the letter.

47
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.130
All right. Imagine that you went somewhere out of your house, for example,

48
00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:44.080
for a work, and you got a notification from an alarm system.

49
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.060
You want to estimate the probability that there is a thief in our house,

50
00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.065
given that there is an alarm,

51
00:02:51.065 --> 00:02:54.905
given that we've gotten notification from an alarm.

52
00:02:54.905 --> 00:03:03.295
This would be, the probability of a thief during the alarm.

53
00:03:03.295 --> 00:03:08.775
Let's use base formula to compute this probability.

54
00:03:08.775 --> 00:03:13.685
This would be the gen probability.

55
00:03:13.685 --> 00:03:22.197
Probability that there is a thief and alarm over the probability of the alarm.

56
00:03:22.197 --> 00:03:26.610
Now, let's use the sum rule.

57
00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.770
I will add another variable the earthquake.

58
00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.250
This would be a thing like this.

59
00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.165
This would be the probability of thief, alarm,

60
00:03:39.165 --> 00:03:44.745
earthquake plus the probability of thief,

61
00:03:44.745 --> 00:03:48.510
alarm and not earthquake.

62
00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.380
Then, you do the same trick for the numerator.

63
00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.760
This wouldn't be the probability of thief, alarm,

64
00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:02.150
earthquake, plus probability of thief, alarm,

65
00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:09.230
and not earthquake, plus another two terms,

66
00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.060
with no thief in our house.

67
00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.085
So, alarm, earthquake, and finally,

68
00:04:17.085 --> 00:04:22.270
probability there was no thief,

69
00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.140
alarm notification and no earthquake.

70
00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.970
Let's compute these terms.

71
00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.935
Let's start with the first one.

72
00:04:32.935 --> 00:04:37.745
What is the general probability of these three events.

73
00:04:37.745 --> 00:04:40.310
We can write them down using the model.

74
00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.555
The gen probability actually goes from this model,

75
00:04:44.555 --> 00:04:54.290
to probability of alarm given thief and an earthquake.

76
00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:57.030
That was a probability of thief,

77
00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:02.331
and probability of an earthquake.

78
00:05:02.331 --> 00:05:05.920
All right, where do we get these numbers?

79
00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:09.350
So the probability of the thief is here,

80
00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:12.030
it is this number,

81
00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:17.370
the probability of an earthquake is this number, and finally,

82
00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.815
the probability of alarm given that there is a thief and an earthquake,

83
00:05:20.815 --> 00:05:26.250
we can get it from here so it would be this.

84
00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:30.350
Finally, we get 10 to the power of minus three,

85
00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:33.145
times 10 to the power of minus two, times one.

86
00:05:33.145 --> 00:05:37.380
This would be equal to 10 to the power of minus five.

87
00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:46.520
Let's compute

88
00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.170
some other probabilities.

89
00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:52.105
For example, let's compute this probability.

90
00:05:52.105 --> 00:05:54.812
What is the probability that there is no thief,

91
00:05:54.812 --> 00:05:57.775
there is no earthquake and there an alarm?

92
00:05:57.775 --> 00:06:02.125
Again, we can write it in a similar way.

93
00:06:02.125 --> 00:06:10.251
It will be a probability of alarm, given no thief,

94
00:06:10.251 --> 00:06:14.915
no earthquake, as a probability of no thief,

95
00:06:14.915 --> 00:06:20.488
and probability of no earthquake.

96
00:06:20.488 --> 00:06:23.145
What is the value of the first term?

97
00:06:23.145 --> 00:06:26.150
This is the probability of alarm,

98
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:31.005
given that there is no thief and no earthquake so it is 0.

99
00:06:31.005 --> 00:06:35.075
Finally, this probability would be 0.

100
00:06:35.075 --> 00:06:38.659
We can cross it out.

101
00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:44.085
We can compute all of those terms in a similar way.

102
00:06:44.085 --> 00:06:46.335
If we do the math right,

103
00:06:46.335 --> 00:06:49.270
we'll get the value of around 50%.

104
00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:58.155
This would be somewhere around 50%.

105
00:06:58.155 --> 00:07:01.810
So the probability that there is a thief in our house,

106
00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:05.005
we would get alarm notification is around 50%.

107
00:07:05.005 --> 00:07:08.560
Would you trust all your belongings if you're going?

108
00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.090
Well, certainly not.

109
00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:12.183
You get into a car,

110
00:07:12.183 --> 00:07:15.955
and head to your house.

111
00:07:15.955 --> 00:07:18.935
On the way home,

112
00:07:18.935 --> 00:07:21.490
you get another notification,

113
00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:23.675
from the radio report.

114
00:07:23.675 --> 00:07:29.230
If you heard a radio report that there was an earthquake in that area near your house.

115
00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:31.510
Now, you want to estimate another probability.

116
00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:37.852
The probability that there is a thief in your house,

117
00:07:37.852 --> 00:07:45.775
given that you heard an alarm and also radio report.

118
00:07:45.775 --> 00:07:49.610
We can do this in a similar way.

119
00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:54.360
This would be the ratio between the joint probability.

120
00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:59.140
So this is thief, alarm, and the radio report,

121
00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:06.675
over the probability of alarm and the radio reports.

122
00:08:06.675 --> 00:08:11.415
Let's add the missing variable to the numerator.

123
00:08:11.415 --> 00:08:12.868
This is an earthquake,

124
00:08:12.868 --> 00:08:15.830
and missing variables to the denominator,

125
00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:20.285
those are the thief, and an earthquake.

126
00:08:20.285 --> 00:08:25.155
You have again, something like this.

127
00:08:25.155 --> 00:08:30.035
Probability of thief, alarm, radio report,

128
00:08:30.035 --> 00:08:34.825
and an earthquake, plus the probability of thief,

129
00:08:34.825 --> 00:08:39.120
alarm, radio reports, and no earthquake.

130
00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:41.625
This is some rule again.

131
00:08:41.625 --> 00:08:47.300
The same thing will be in the denominator so probability of alarm,

132
00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:51.070
radio report, thief and earthquake,

133
00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:55.860
plus probability of alarm, radio report, thief,

134
00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:58.270
not earthquake, and finally,

135
00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:02.595
not finally but, we need more turns.

136
00:09:02.595 --> 00:09:06.390
So alarm, radio report,

137
00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:08.210
not a thief and alarm,

138
00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:11.040
and now finally, the probability of alarm,

139
00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:16.230
radio reports, and no thief and no earthquake.

140
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:17.512
All right.

141
00:09:17.512 --> 00:09:22.680
Let's compute this in a simple way.

142
00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:25.785
So this term, from our model,

143
00:09:25.785 --> 00:09:28.645
we calls it falling form.

144
00:09:28.645 --> 00:09:33.585
This is probability of an alarm given,

145
00:09:33.585 --> 00:09:36.793
thief and an earthquake,

146
00:09:36.793 --> 00:09:41.238
times probability of the radio report of the earthquake,

147
00:09:41.238 --> 00:09:46.925
times and probability of the thief and probability of an earthquake.

148
00:09:46.925 --> 00:09:49.900
You can find this value interesting.

149
00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:51.780
Also, let's compute, for example,

150
00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:57.165
the probability that there was no earthquake,

151
00:09:57.165 --> 00:10:00.585
there was a thief in our house, and there was a radio report.

152
00:10:00.585 --> 00:10:03.770
In this case, the one of the turns that

153
00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:08.080
the probability of the radio report given that there is no earthquake is 0,

154
00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:10.985
so this term would be 0.

155
00:10:10.985 --> 00:10:15.060
And also this term goes to 0 so, finally,

156
00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:22.260
we get the very overall 1%.

157
00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:27.855
You come home and you get to the probability of 1%.

158
00:10:27.855 --> 00:10:32.895
You think that is a fairly small probability and so you come back to work.

159
00:10:32.895 --> 00:10:36.560
But in the evening, when you come back home you see that your house was

160
00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:42.400
robbed and you ask yourself why this happened.

161
00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:45.080
It seems like you computed the probabilities correctly.

162
00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:49.460
However, it turns out that we define our model

163
00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:55.230
in the wrong way so it is actually there are more thieves when there are earthquakes.

164
00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:59.830
Our model should look like this.
