00:00:04.858 --> 00:00:09.334
In this video, we will see another
approach to avoid computing the evidence.

3
00:00:09.334 --> 00:00:12.268
It is called the conjugate distributions.

4
00:00:12.268 --> 00:00:14.779
Here's our Bayes formula again.

5
00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:17.732
Note that a likelihood is
fixed by our model, and

6
00:00:17.732 --> 00:00:19.830
the evidence is fixed by our data.

7
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.673
What we can vary though is a prior,
and it is our own choice.

8
00:00:24.673 --> 00:00:30.442
So let's select it in the way, let's
prove it easier to compute the procedure.

9
00:00:34.221 --> 00:00:37.370
The prior is said to be
conjugate to the likelihood.

10
00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:45.449
If the prior and the posterior lie
in the same family of distributions.

11
00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:50.288
For example, if the prior was normal
parameterized by some parameters mu and

12
00:00:50.288 --> 00:00:53.787
sigma, we'd expect the posterior
to be also normal but

13
00:00:53.787 --> 00:00:56.030
with some other mean end variance.

14
00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:57.600
Here's an example.

15
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.139
Our likelihood is normal since with
around theta with suffix squared and

16
00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:04.422
sigma squared.

17
00:01:04.422 --> 00:01:08.499
What would be the conjugate prior?

18
00:01:08.499 --> 00:01:12.644
Well, what if we choose
a normal distribution?

19
00:01:12.644 --> 00:01:15.514
Here, I have two normal distributions.

20
00:01:15.514 --> 00:01:17.778
What will happen if I multiply them and

21
00:01:17.778 --> 00:01:21.115
renormalize in the way that
they were integrate to one?

22
00:01:21.115 --> 00:01:24.319
Actually, we'll get again
a normal distribution.

23
00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:25.857
Why does it happen so?

24
00:01:25.857 --> 00:01:30.796
The normal distribution is actually
a constant times the exponent

25
00:01:30.796 --> 00:01:33.094
in the power of some parabola.

26
00:01:33.094 --> 00:01:38.440
And when we multiply two long
distributions, those two parabolas sum up.

27
00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.979
And, again, we get another parabola.

28
00:01:45.493 --> 00:01:49.464
So the solution to this problem
would be a normal distribution.

29
00:01:49.464 --> 00:01:55.266
To be a normal of theta,
parameterized by some mean m and

30
00:01:55.266 --> 00:01:58.110
variance sigma s squared.

31
00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.433
And the posterior would be also normal,

32
00:02:02.433 --> 00:02:08.421
parameterized by some mu mean a and
variance b squared.

33
00:02:08.421 --> 00:02:11.961
So let's see how it works
on a numerical example.

34
00:02:11.961 --> 00:02:17.773
Imagine that the likelihood is a normal
centered around theta with variance 1,

35
00:02:17.773 --> 00:02:20.346
and the prior is a standard normal.

36
00:02:20.346 --> 00:02:22.670
That is the mean is 0 and
the variance is 1.

37
00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:28.195
We can drop all the constants and
get the following form.

38
00:02:28.195 --> 00:02:31.230
So we have the product of two exponents.

39
00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.478
You will rearrange the terms,

40
00:02:33.478 --> 00:02:39.543
we will get the exponent from which we can
easily find out the mean and the variance.

41
00:02:39.543 --> 00:02:45.405
The mean will be x squared x half,
and the variance would be also half.
