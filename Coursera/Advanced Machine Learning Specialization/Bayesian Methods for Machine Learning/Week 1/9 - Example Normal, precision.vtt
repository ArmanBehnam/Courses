00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.085
This, in the next video,

2
00:00:06.085 --> 00:00:09.785
we'll see another examples of conjugate priors.

3
00:00:09.785 --> 00:00:13.050
Well, before we continue, we need to learn some new distributions.

4
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.950
And what we will learn now is called a gamma distribution.

5
00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.010
Its probability density function is given as follows.

6
00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.330
It is parameterized by two parameters, a and b.

7
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.290
Those are assumed to be positive.

8
00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:28.704
Gamma is also assumed to be positive.

9
00:00:28.704 --> 00:00:34.615
That is, the gamma distribution is a distribution over positive axis.

10
00:00:34.615 --> 00:00:38.880
It's probability density function plot look as follows.

11
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.105
So, you can see, it can be either a unimodal distribution,

12
00:00:43.105 --> 00:00:48.280
or can be a exponential decaying one depending on which parameters we will choose.

13
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:54.457
Its functional form is gamma to the power of a minus one,

14
00:00:54.457 --> 00:00:58.750
times the exponent of minus b gamma.

15
00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:04.060
For some parameters, the first term is increasing function,

16
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:06.040
the second term is decreasing function.

17
00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.330
We can model the unimodal of distribution.

18
00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.430
Then the this constant looks as b to the power of a over gamma function of a.

19
00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.573
The gamma function is a smooth extension of a factorial.

20
00:01:20.573 --> 00:01:26.380
That is, the gamma at point n equals to the n minus one factorial.

21
00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.655
For example, gamma of five equals to 24.

22
00:01:29.655 --> 00:01:32.107
Its statistics are given as follows,

23
00:01:32.107 --> 00:01:34.720
the mean value equals to a/b.

24
00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.090
The mode is a-1/b,

25
00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.510
and the variance is a/b squared.

26
00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:45.760
Let's see example how we can apply the gamma distribution to model real things.

27
00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.600
Imagine that you run everyday.

28
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.195
You run somewhere around five kilometers.

29
00:01:50.195 --> 00:01:52.360
However, some days you are bit more active.

30
00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.540
Some days you are bit tired and so,

31
00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.825
you can run 100 meters more or 100 meters less.

32
00:01:59.825 --> 00:02:03.550
This means that the expected value of the distance that you run is

33
00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:10.570
five kilometers and the variance is 0.1-1 kilometer squared.

34
00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:15.520
So, we can model these as your run variable that has a gamma distribution.

35
00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.365
We could also use a normal distribution, however,

36
00:02:18.365 --> 00:02:24.250
it would imply that you can run a negative distance, which is impossible.

37
00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.940
We can plug in those values into the formulas

38
00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.390
for the mean and the variance and find out that a should be

39
00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:40.705
equal to 2,500 and b should be equal to 500 and for density would look like this.

40
00:02:40.705 --> 00:02:46.560
The gamma distribution is actually conjugate to be normal with respect to the precision.

41
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.445
I haven't defined precision yet so let's do that now.

42
00:02:50.445 --> 00:02:54.030
The precision is inverse of the variance.

43
00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.905
For example, here are the blue curve has high precision that

44
00:02:56.905 --> 00:03:00.485
these you can easily predict where these samples would be.

45
00:03:00.485 --> 00:03:03.430
However, it has a low variance and

46
00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.415
the green line would have high variance and low precision.

47
00:03:08.415 --> 00:03:13.405
Here's the probability density function of a normal distribution.

48
00:03:13.405 --> 00:03:16.410
If we replace the variance with the inverse of that precision,

49
00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.875
we'll get the following formula.

50
00:03:18.875 --> 00:03:20.353
Now, we asked ourselves,

51
00:03:20.353 --> 00:03:26.450
what is the conjugate prior with respect to the precision?

52
00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.333
Here's our formula again.

53
00:03:29.333 --> 00:03:32.970
If we drop all the constants that do not depend on gamma,

54
00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.780
we'll get the following function.

55
00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.990
Let's try to find the conjugate distribution in the following way.

56
00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:46.725
It would be proportional to gamma power 1/2 times the exponent of minus b gamma.

57
00:03:46.725 --> 00:03:48.585
What if four cannot?

58
00:03:48.585 --> 00:03:49.991
What do you expect.?

59
00:03:49.991 --> 00:03:52.195
All right. Let's check it out.

60
00:03:52.195 --> 00:03:53.790
Here's our basic formula.

61
00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.400
Again, we can drop the denominator since it does

62
00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.960
not depend on the parameters and we'll get the form functional form.

63
00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.165
If we rearrange the terms,

64
00:04:03.165 --> 00:04:08.227
we see that the gamma now has the power of 1,

65
00:04:08.227 --> 00:04:14.460
which means that it doesn't lie in the same form of distributions.

66
00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:20.955
They wanted, as we considered before had the power of 1/2 so this is a wrong answer.

67
00:04:20.955 --> 00:04:24.050
What if we choose a gamma distribution?

68
00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:30.775
That is we'll have another parameter that would allow us to vary the power of the gamma.

69
00:04:30.775 --> 00:04:32.870
It would look like follows.

70
00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.875
Again, this is gamma distribution parameterized by two parameters a and b.

71
00:04:35.875 --> 00:04:40.539
Well, let's try to compute the posterior.

72
00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:42.795
Again, here is our prior.

73
00:04:42.795 --> 00:04:45.615
Here's our posterior.

74
00:04:45.615 --> 00:04:48.865
It is proportional to the likelihood times of prior.

75
00:04:48.865 --> 00:04:52.605
Here is what we get if we drop all the constants.

76
00:04:52.605 --> 00:04:54.380
If we rearrange the terms,

77
00:04:54.380 --> 00:05:00.348
we'll get the gamma to some new power times the exponent of the minus gamma times new

78
00:05:00.348 --> 00:05:07.430
constant and so we can estimate the parameters for the posterior from this form.

79
00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:14.746
So the mean would be a+1/2 and the variance would be b+sum of quadratic term,

80
00:05:14.746 --> 00:05:21.850
and so we avoided computing the evidence simply by choosing the conjugate prior.
