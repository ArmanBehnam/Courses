2
00:00:04.546 --> 00:00:08.962
In this video, we will derive the formulas
for training Gaussian process.

3
00:00:08.962 --> 00:00:11.504
So here's our set up again.

4
00:00:11.504 --> 00:00:17.087
We have the probability of our new
point given all previous points.

5
00:00:17.087 --> 00:00:21.155
And it equals to the ratio
between the joint probability and

6
00:00:21.155 --> 00:00:23.362
the conditional probability.

7
00:00:23.362 --> 00:00:28.629
So we have here the denominator, the joint
probability over the known points.

8
00:00:28.629 --> 00:00:33.005
And in the numerator we have the known
points and the unknown point.

9
00:00:33.005 --> 00:00:37.296
Let me denote the unknown point as f star.

10
00:00:37.296 --> 00:00:41.671
So this would be equal to f star.

11
00:00:41.671 --> 00:00:46.962
This factor here would be f.

12
00:00:46.962 --> 00:00:49.477
And so as we saw in the previous video,

13
00:00:49.477 --> 00:00:53.337
we'll have the ratio between
two normal distributions.

14
00:00:53.337 --> 00:00:58.159
The one in the numerator would
have the f star and f vector,

15
00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:02.798
given the mean 0 and
the covariance matrix as follows.

16
00:01:02.798 --> 00:01:05.464
And the same would be in the denominator.

17
00:01:05.464 --> 00:01:09.838
We'll normal distribution over f.

18
00:01:09.838 --> 00:01:12.921
The mean is 0 and
the convergence matrix is C.

19
00:01:12.921 --> 00:01:15.380
All right, let's write them down.

20
00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.620
So it will be proportional

21
00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:27.296
to exponent of minus one-half.

22
00:01:27.296 --> 00:01:31.289
This virtual transposed,

23
00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:36.148
it would be f star, f transpose,

24
00:01:37.363 --> 00:01:40.671
convergence matrix.

25
00:01:44.461 --> 00:01:49.073
K tanspose K, C,

26
00:01:49.073 --> 00:01:55.225
inverse and this vector

27
00:01:55.225 --> 00:02:00.462
again, so f star f.

28
00:02:00.462 --> 00:02:05.297
So this is a term from the numerator, and
we have also a term from the denominator.

29
00:02:05.297 --> 00:02:06.879
We'll have plus,

30
00:02:11.004 --> 00:02:16.304
Plus f transposed

31
00:02:16.304 --> 00:02:20.546
C inversed f.

32
00:02:20.546 --> 00:02:26.462
All right,
now let's see what this term equals to.

33
00:02:26.462 --> 00:02:34.837
So we'll have exponent of minus
one-half times the following thing.

34
00:02:34.837 --> 00:02:39.754
We'll have to see what is
the inverse matrix for this term.

35
00:02:39.754 --> 00:02:44.087
Let's write it down as
some arbitrary matrix.

36
00:02:44.087 --> 00:02:49.274
We'll have components d,

37
00:02:49.274 --> 00:02:53.337
b transpose, b, A.

38
00:02:53.337 --> 00:02:57.013
So this is just a inverse
matrix of this matrix, but

39
00:02:57.013 --> 00:02:59.671
we don't know the components of it.

40
00:02:59.671 --> 00:03:04.171
So we can plug it in here, and we'll have,

41
00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:12.629
D times f star squared.

42
00:03:17.378 --> 00:03:21.379
Plus 2 times,

43
00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:30.797
We'll have b transposed
f times the f star.

44
00:03:33.421 --> 00:03:37.962
And we also have some constants
that not depend on f star.

45
00:03:37.962 --> 00:03:41.171
So let me write down some const.

46
00:03:46.212 --> 00:03:50.837
All right,
now we have to take the full squared.

47
00:03:50.837 --> 00:03:56.341
So it would be exponent of -1 over,

48
00:03:56.341 --> 00:03:59.891
let's take this term,

49
00:03:59.891 --> 00:04:04.337
d here, out of the brackets.

50
00:04:04.337 --> 00:04:07.671
So we'll put it here.

51
00:04:07.671 --> 00:04:15.046
This would be 1 over 2d power -1.

52
00:04:15.046 --> 00:04:20.773
We'll have f star here,

53
00:04:20.773 --> 00:04:28.961
plus b transposed f over d squared.

54
00:04:28.961 --> 00:04:34.462
And times some multiplicative constant,
let me write down here as proportional to.

55
00:04:36.755 --> 00:04:41.905
Okay, so from this we can easily see that

56
00:04:41.905 --> 00:04:47.212
the mean value is -b transposed f over d.

57
00:04:47.212 --> 00:04:53.753
So mu equals 2- b transposed f over d.

58
00:04:53.753 --> 00:04:55.837
And the variance is simply d.

59
00:05:00.504 --> 00:05:03.046
So those are our formulas.

60
00:05:05.961 --> 00:05:13.492
And the result would be the normal
distribution over f star,

61
00:05:13.492 --> 00:05:20.296
given mean mu from here,
and variance sigma squared.

62
00:05:20.296 --> 00:05:24.775
All right, so we haven't finished yet,
since we have d and

63
00:05:24.775 --> 00:05:28.462
b here and
we don't know the values for them yet.

64
00:05:28.462 --> 00:05:33.062
So those are just some
parameters that should be

65
00:05:33.062 --> 00:05:37.088
equal to the inverse matrix of this term.

66
00:05:37.088 --> 00:05:38.420
So let's derive them.

67
00:05:45.921 --> 00:05:50.610
Okay, so the simplest way to
derive them is to remember,

68
00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:54.226
since this is an inverse of this matrix,
and

69
00:05:54.226 --> 00:05:58.056
then their product would
be identity matrix.

70
00:05:58.056 --> 00:06:01.503
So we have k of 0.

71
00:06:01.503 --> 00:06:08.798
K transposed K,
C trans inverse in this form.

72
00:06:08.798 --> 00:06:12.100
So it is d b transposed b A,

73
00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:17.212
should be equal to the identity matrix.

74
00:06:17.212 --> 00:06:21.155
So we'll have scalar 1 here,

75
00:06:21.155 --> 00:06:27.380
Two vectors of 0 here,
and indent matrix here.

76
00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:31.629
All right, so
actually we have many equations here.

77
00:06:31.629 --> 00:06:39.041
We can multiply this matrices explicitly,

78
00:06:39.041 --> 00:06:44.046
so we'll have K of 0 times d +

79
00:06:44.046 --> 00:06:48.671
k transpose b equals to 1.

80
00:06:48.671 --> 00:06:54.813
We have K of 0 b transpose

81
00:06:54.813 --> 00:07:02.129
+ K transpose A equals to 0.

82
00:07:02.129 --> 00:07:06.107
And two more terms,

83
00:07:06.107 --> 00:07:12.191
those are kd + cb equals to 0,

84
00:07:12.191 --> 00:07:17.575
and finally kb transpose +

85
00:07:17.575 --> 00:07:23.671
CA equals to identity matrix.

86
00:07:23.671 --> 00:07:28.193
All right, so we're interested
in values for b and d, and

87
00:07:28.193 --> 00:07:30.879
we don't have to find A actually.

88
00:07:30.879 --> 00:07:33.047
So let's see what we have then.

89
00:07:33.047 --> 00:07:38.848
So in this term, we have b here and

90
00:07:38.848 --> 00:07:42.796
d here, b, b, d, b.

91
00:07:42.796 --> 00:07:46.218
All right, actually we need to find
the two equations from those two,

92
00:07:46.218 --> 00:07:47.088
from those four.

93
00:07:47.088 --> 00:07:51.503
We need this equation
since it has both d and b.

94
00:07:51.503 --> 00:07:55.087
And this one,
since also we have here d and b.

95
00:07:55.087 --> 00:07:58.779
And we can notice here that the number
of equations equals the number of known

96
00:07:58.779 --> 00:07:59.480
parameters.

97
00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:03.548
So we can hope that we
will be able to solve it.

98
00:08:03.548 --> 00:08:08.671
So let's start from the second equation.

99
00:08:08.671 --> 00:08:16.026
We can see that from this equation,

100
00:08:16.026 --> 00:08:21.671
b equals to -c inverse kd.

101
00:08:21.671 --> 00:08:25.796
We can plug in b from this formula here.

102
00:08:25.796 --> 00:08:30.889
And then we'll have k of 0 times

103
00:08:30.889 --> 00:08:37.879
d plus k transpose c
inverse kd equals to 1.

104
00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:46.963
So from this formula,
we can see that, We have d here.

105
00:08:46.963 --> 00:08:52.487
And so the value for d would be,

106
00:08:52.487 --> 00:08:57.161
d equal to 1 over K of 0 + k

107
00:08:57.161 --> 00:09:01.422
transpose c inverse k.

108
00:09:04.128 --> 00:09:08.754
The final step is to plug in
the value of d from here to b.

109
00:09:08.754 --> 00:09:13.196
So we'll have b equal to

110
00:09:13.196 --> 00:09:18.081
-c inverse k over K of 0 +

111
00:09:18.081 --> 00:09:22.753
k transpose C inverse k.

112
00:09:22.753 --> 00:09:28.128
Now we need to plug in d and b into
the formulas for mean and the variance.

113
00:09:28.128 --> 00:09:30.421
So the variance would be the inverse of d.

114
00:09:30.421 --> 00:09:35.426
So it would be K of 0 + k

115
00:09:35.426 --> 00:09:40.963
transposed C inverse k.

116
00:09:40.963 --> 00:09:44.608
And the mean would be, so

117
00:09:44.608 --> 00:09:50.171
we have b here, we should write down.

118
00:09:50.171 --> 00:09:54.312
I'm just going to write it
down more carefully, so

119
00:09:54.312 --> 00:09:57.046
it would be b transpose f over d.

120
00:09:57.046 --> 00:10:03.912
So b transposed is
simply k transpose c -1,

121
00:10:03.912 --> 00:10:09.151
since c is metric, times f over K of

122
00:10:09.151 --> 00:10:15.131
0 + k transpose C inverse k and, or d.

123
00:10:15.131 --> 00:10:20.060
So it would be K of 0 + k

124
00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:25.255
transpose C inverse k.

125
00:10:25.255 --> 00:10:30.212
And here we have two similar terms,
we can cancel them out.

126
00:10:30.212 --> 00:10:33.755
So these two.

127
00:10:33.755 --> 00:10:38.712
And so, finally we have that
the mean value equals to,

128
00:10:40.921 --> 00:10:45.296
K transposed c inverse f.

129
00:10:45.296 --> 00:10:48.504
And so, those are our final formulas.

130
00:10:48.504 --> 00:10:52.796
So sigma squared equals to this term.

131
00:10:52.796 --> 00:11:00.921
The variance K of 0 + k
transpose C inverse k.

132
00:11:00.921 --> 00:11:07.129
And for
the mean we have k transpose C inverse f.

133
00:11:07.129 --> 00:11:17.129
