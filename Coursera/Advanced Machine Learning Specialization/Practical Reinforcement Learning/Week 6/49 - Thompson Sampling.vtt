00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.825
The one we're going to study now is the fact that the first option is unknown.

2
00:00:07.825 --> 00:00:10.530
There is this new particle no one knows about it.

3
00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.915
Well, the second one, it turns out most people have

4
00:00:13.915 --> 00:00:17.875
tried doing this some time in their childhood years.

5
00:00:17.875 --> 00:00:21.340
And they might not remember it

6
00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.510
directly or this they may have read about it or have seen it in other person.

7
00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.340
They probably know the outcome of

8
00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:33.655
the second research opportunity pretty good to not try this at home anytime soon.

9
00:00:33.655 --> 00:00:36.070
So, we want to partase actions that are uncertain

10
00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.080
whose outcomes are not yet that well known to us.

11
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.405
And to actually implement this in any practical algorithm,

12
00:00:43.405 --> 00:00:47.125
we won't just require the Q values themselves.

13
00:00:47.125 --> 00:00:49.420
Just want the probability of Q value,

14
00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:50.920
it is Bayesian sense.

15
00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.190
So basically our belief expressed as a probability,

16
00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.300
the the Q value is going to turn out to be this or that number.

17
00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.330
In the plot here at the bottom of the slide,

18
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:05.695
in one particular stage you can see three probability distribution for actions,

19
00:01:05.695 --> 00:01:07.960
that each should present, our belief about

20
00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.865
each particular actions Q value in a particular state.

21
00:01:10.865 --> 00:01:14.130
Again for the third time we emphasize it is a Bayesian probability.

22
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.530
It means that, the variance the breadth of

23
00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.365
this curve doesn't represent the randomness in the action itself,

24
00:01:21.365 --> 00:01:22.595
but only our belief.

25
00:01:22.595 --> 00:01:25.700
It means that if the green action is

26
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.205
actually deterministic but we have never tried it yet so we have no idea,

27
00:01:29.205 --> 00:01:31.075
or we've only tried it a few times,

28
00:01:31.075 --> 00:01:35.120
then it means that is going be quite broad anyway.

29
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.020
While the orange action can actually be very noisy.

30
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.465
It can have very wide turn plus and minus 10.

31
00:01:41.465 --> 00:01:46.130
What we are dead sure that it's expected to turn is going be what is it?

32
00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.535
Point five or whatever, 0.6.

33
00:01:48.535 --> 00:01:50.190
So it's our belief,

34
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:51.785
expressed as a probability distribution,

35
00:01:51.785 --> 00:01:55.240
the same way you did in a Bayesian methods course at the beginning of the RFP.

36
00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:02.610
And our challenge here is to pick an action not just given the action values,

37
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.160
but given the beliefs we have about them.

38
00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.890
So now we're done with this.

39
00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.560
We have this one state and three actions,

40
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.940
and the beliefs of

41
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.060
the Q values of those actions are represented with those distributions.

42
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.955
So these our actual beliefs of what the Q value is going to turn out.

43
00:02:18.955 --> 00:02:21.580
Now I want you to tell me,

44
00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.790
which actions of those three are even eligible?

45
00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.700
Which of them it makes sense to pick,

46
00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.970
regardless of what method we use?

47
00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.175
Well, turns out yes.

48
00:02:32.175 --> 00:02:36.735
Thing is, the blue action is oftenly mis-regardless of how we pick it.

49
00:02:36.735 --> 00:02:42.260
Because the orange one dominates into expectation.

50
00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.970
So if we want to exploit it would always be

51
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.330
the orange one not the blue one it's just better,

52
00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.900
and if want to explore the blue action is dominated by the green one.

53
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.520
So, the green one has some chance of being better than the orange,

54
00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.850
if we believe this belief distributions sorry for the totoligy.

55
00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.090
But the blue one won't be any better.

56
00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.130
So, either a green one,

57
00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:06.240
or the orange one.

58
00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.650
Depending on how you prefer to explore and exploit.

59
00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.480
So now let's get to some algorithms that actually

60
00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.110
decide what's the probability of picking the green action or the orange one,

61
00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.150
and hopefully don't pick the blue one ever.

62
00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.265
Lets begin with Thompson sampling.

63
00:03:20.265 --> 00:03:24.210
This algorithm is actually a more general one,

64
00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.610
but we are only going to study its simpler form for now.

65
00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.690
Thompson sampling actually suggests that you take one sample,

66
00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.360
from each of those distributions and assuming they are

67
00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.670
normal distributions you can just take the sample and if they're imping distributions,

68
00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.020
histograms you can just take,

69
00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.015
MPR random sample or whatever.

70
00:03:40.015 --> 00:03:42.235
And then you'll get three points,

71
00:03:42.235 --> 00:03:44.780
three Q values of each action.

72
00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.190
The Thompson sampling wants you to pick an action

73
00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.985
whose sample Q value is going be largest.

74
00:03:49.985 --> 00:03:52.065
The question to you is,

75
00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:54.375
on average if you see those points,

76
00:03:54.375 --> 00:03:57.060
which actions is going be picked the most,

77
00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.895
which is going be picked the least, and which working?

78
00:03:59.895 --> 00:04:02.520
What are the probabilities of taking each actions?

79
00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:08.110
Of course there's more than one possible way to interpret those histograms,

80
00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.870
but in general, you can more or less say that,

81
00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.580
the blue one is going to have a lot of zero,

82
00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.890
because regardless of what you sample from it,

83
00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.760
there's a chance of one that's a sample from red one will be larger.

84
00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.975
So, it's no longer needs to be explored.

85
00:04:20.975 --> 00:04:23.865
Sample from red one is between say,

86
00:04:23.865 --> 00:04:27.975
roughly 0.3 and say 0.8 or nine.

87
00:04:27.975 --> 00:04:30.444
While the sample from green can be anywhere between

88
00:04:30.444 --> 00:04:33.710
minus whatever two plus one and something.

89
00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.370
This actually means that,

90
00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.530
at some points you will actually pick the green one as

91
00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.000
it is better for you to explore it,

92
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.250
and at other points you'll pick the orange.

93
00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.280
Ofcourse you can also sample with some temperature use

94
00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.550
importance sampling to skew this towards more exploration or more exploitation.

95
00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.215
Flatten error thing and this time,

96
00:04:53.215 --> 00:04:55.480
you're going be more exploring.

97
00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:01.100
Or you can sample proportionally to square of each probability and it's be exploiting

98
00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:13.050
all the time.
