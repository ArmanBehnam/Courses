00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.960
The general idea about how reinforcements learning

2
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.305
operates is it has some kind of decision process,

3
00:00:10.305 --> 00:00:13.975
and we've already seen the decision process in the banner ads example.

4
00:00:13.975 --> 00:00:16.740
In this case, you have a website which is your agent,

5
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.430
something that can take actions.

6
00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.010
And this website repeatedly observe

7
00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.650
users that browse particular pages and can take an action.

8
00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.465
In this case, its action is to pick up banner and displayed when the page runners.

9
00:00:29.465 --> 00:00:33.965
Finally, the agent gets the feedback whenever it shows an action to a user.

10
00:00:33.965 --> 00:00:36.095
The feedback, in this case, is a binary one,

11
00:00:36.095 --> 00:00:38.465
it's either user clicks or he doesn't.

12
00:00:38.465 --> 00:00:40.970
Now, of course, there is a number of similar problems.

13
00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:46.185
For example, you can replace banner ad placement with movie recommendations for example,

14
00:00:46.185 --> 00:00:48.925
or you can even consider from a medical treatment.

15
00:00:48.925 --> 00:00:52.410
In this case, you have a patient that goes to a doctor and

16
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.160
the doctor is your agent and your agent observes the symptoms of

17
00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.340
a patients to apply a treatment to him and then he gets a feedback on

18
00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.510
how well did the patient feel

19
00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.890
himself after the treatment was applied or whether he survived or not.

20
00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.130
Now, let's consider this kind of practice problem.

21
00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.390
Let's say that you have an online shop and it's online shop,

22
00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.420
you're selling not movies, but let's say,

23
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.020
you're selling books, and you have a user base that's

24
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.185
mostly authorized so they have some personal data entered about them.

25
00:01:23.185 --> 00:01:27.510
And what you want to do is you want to sell them as much books as possible.

26
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.905
And you want them to be satisfied with the books they buy.

27
00:01:29.905 --> 00:01:31.210
To make them want to buy,

28
00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.620
you want to develop a system that recommends books to your users.

29
00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:41.425
So in this case, if you're trying to optimize your money and your user's happiness,

30
00:01:41.425 --> 00:01:44.260
how would you define the observation that your agent gets?

31
00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:45.890
What would you include there?

32
00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.040
What kind of actions your agent can take?

33
00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.800
And finally, what kind of feedback will he

34
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.455
receive and what kind of thing do you want to optimize there?

35
00:01:53.455 --> 00:01:57.020
So of course, this is more or less obvious,

36
00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.660
but there are a lot of possible choices that are all correct.

37
00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.620
For example, you find user features in great many ways.

38
00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.030
Generally, you want to include here the features,

39
00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.110
the interest that your user has, his age,

40
00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.535
his gender, maybe some kind of

41
00:02:13.535 --> 00:02:16.610
previous books you're out and whether he likes them or not.

42
00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.280
And you also want to include any other information

43
00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.170
like maybe his social network account, if you have access to one.

44
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.480
For actions, you now have books and each action basically corresponds

45
00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.165
to trying to recommend the particular book to your customer whenever he visits your site.

46
00:02:31.165 --> 00:02:34.770
And obviously, your feedback is whether a user

47
00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.950
like this book or maybe how much revenue do you get from it.

48
00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.830
Depending on your agreed for money.

49
00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.945
So this particular problem is usually referred to as the multi-armed bandit problem.

50
00:02:46.945 --> 00:02:48.900
The name originates from gambling,

51
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.895
you can consider yourself not trying to assign the optimal banner to each user,

52
00:02:52.895 --> 00:02:54.890
but gambling in a casino.

53
00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:56.870
And in this case,

54
00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.585
showing each banner is like pulling the lever of a slot machine.

55
00:03:00.585 --> 00:03:03.120
In this case, you want to find a slot machine which

56
00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.750
brings you the highest rewards or find

57
00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.760
the strategy of the banner which gives you

58
00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.995
the highest probability of user clicking and the benefit of either paying you money.

59
00:03:11.995 --> 00:03:13.650
The same comes to recommendations,

60
00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.780
but instead of showing banners to get money explicitly,

61
00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.100
you can recommend user some kind of movies so that he wishes down

62
00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.995
becomes happy and the overall happiness of humanity grows higher.

63
00:03:25.995 --> 00:03:29.860
And of course, for this problem should

64
00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.570
not be viewed explicitly as the gambling problem because in any casino,

65
00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.390
you are more or less certain from the of

66
00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.340
said that every slot machine is stacked against you.

67
00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.560
So, please don't try reinforcements are in there.

68
00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:45.065
Now, the only issue here is that this formulation is incomplete from many cases.

69
00:03:45.065 --> 00:03:46.840
Remember the clickbait problem,

70
00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.800
so if you show a user some kind of banners that are explicitly designed

71
00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.990
to be clicked often but that then user

72
00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:56.995
dissatisfied after he has clicked on those banners.

73
00:03:56.995 --> 00:04:02.130
You'll probably see hiking for rates initially, but then,

74
00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:08.230
you'll lose all your user base because they're frustrated by your advertisement campaign.

75
00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.730
So, there is one missing link here and it's about how your agents can

76
00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.040
affect the environment that supply him with observations.

77
00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.735
In case of online advertisement,

78
00:04:16.735 --> 00:04:18.410
you have this user base,

79
00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:23.370
note that there's earth planet here and whenever you take a particular action,

80
00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.510
you may affect your user base by either making

81
00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.510
some kind of user into your fan and seeing him more often,

82
00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.305
or basically, scaring him off with some aggressive advertisement

83
00:04:34.305 --> 00:04:40.420
and basically losing this user and having less revenue because of that.
