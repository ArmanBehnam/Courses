00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:12.143
[NOISE]
So,

3
00:00:12.143 --> 00:00:16.777
now let's talk a little bit about the
actual processor inside the Raspberry Pi,

4
00:00:16.777 --> 00:00:17.890
just a bit.

5
00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.570
So it's an ARM based processor.

6
00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:21.930
So what does that mean?

7
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.840
So the processor, it's a Broadcom chip,
right, a Broadcom SoC, but

8
00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.730
it's an ARM based processor.

9
00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.130
So, ARM processors,
ARM is a company, a British company,

10
00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.420
and they license intellectual property.

11
00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.360
So what that means is they don't
actually fabricate these chips.

12
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.920
What they do is they design the chip,
or they design the core of the chip,

13
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.080
the processor core.

14
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.810
So they design the processor, and
then they license the design to a company.

15
00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.490
So they don't fabricate it, they don't
build a chip, they sell it to, they say,

16
00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:55.900
okay, Freescale, for instance,
you can pay us this money,

17
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.080
you can fabricate a number of these chips.

18
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.880
So they give the design to
the processor to, say, Freescale or TI,

19
00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.040
whatever company it is it's licensing.

20
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.350
And then that company
builds a system around it.

21
00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.410
So the picture that we have here on
the right is not our particular processor.

22
00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.220
It's just sort of a generic SoC,
generic System On Chip.

23
00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.850
Now, you can see that
there's a processor up there.

24
00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.510
One of the blocks says
processor on the top.

25
00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:27.090
That block, that would be the ARM
processor core that is licensed from ARM.

26
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.230
But then around that, the company who
licenses it, in our case Broadcom,

27
00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:35.730
would say, okay, in addition to this
processor we need some debug logic,

28
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.000
we need some flash memory,
we need some SRAM.

29
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.330
They take all the other
components that they design.

30
00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.680
Either they design them themselves, or
they license them from other companies, or

31
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.730
ARM itself, right?

32
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.930
They can license all these components or
build them themselves.

33
00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.950
But they build this whole
system around the processor.

34
00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.440
So there is a a processor licensed by ARM,
and

35
00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.250
then there are a bunch of other components
that Broadcom decides to put together.

36
00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.300
And they put them together on
a couple a buses and so on.

37
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.820
And then they make a chip out of it and
they fabricate that, and

38
00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.700
they sell it as their part.

39
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.584
So, even though it's a Broadcom chip,
it's a Broadcom SOC,

40
00:02:09.584 --> 00:02:12.730
it's actually an ARM
processor core inside it.

41
00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.160
And what that means is that defines
the instruction set that's used.

42
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.190
So, these processors, the machine code
instructions that are used are ARM

43
00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.900
machine code instructions, because
at its heart, it's an ARM processor.

44
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.210
So, ARM licenses the intellectual
property, and just so

45
00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:34.117
you know,
ARM licenses most embedded processors,

46
00:02:34.117 --> 00:02:39.310
most processors that you find
in an IOT device of any kind,

47
00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.570
like my cellphone, for instance,
like this camera in front of me.

48
00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.600
All these different devices they all,
almost all of them,

49
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.980
have ARM processors,
ARM cores inside, okay.

50
00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.290
So ARM just dominates that market pretty
well, not completely but pretty well.

51
00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.020
So silicon vendors like Broadcom,
or Freescale, or

52
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.600
whoever build this System On Chip design
based on the ARM IP, IP standing for

53
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.710
intellectual property.

54
00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:10.320
Over 15 silicon vendors use ARM and
they dominate.

55
00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.965
And ours is a Broadcom BCM2836 SoC,

56
00:03:14.965 --> 00:03:19.891
based on an ARM Cortex A7 processor core.

57
00:03:19.891 --> 00:03:23.849
So ARM Cortex A7 is the name of
the processor core ARM sells, or

58
00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:26.850
one of the many processor
cores that ARM sells.

59
00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.291
So just let's take a glance
at this ARM processor family,

60
00:03:32.291 --> 00:03:34.700
ARM sells a lot of processor cores.

61
00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.460
This is ARM's marketing material and

62
00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:40.530
they are trying to plot all
the different processors that they sell.

63
00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.700
Now, if we look at it on the left side,
in the blue,

64
00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.940
they have what are called
the classic processors.

65
00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.580
That's ARM 7, ARM 9 ARM 11.

66
00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.245
Classic means old, okay,
so they're old processors.

67
00:03:52.245 --> 00:03:54.780
Now, they still support
these because there are so

68
00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.660
many out there in the wild, right?

69
00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.030
Because there are so
many products that still have those.

70
00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.650
But newer products, those parts are,

71
00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.720
I don't even know if they license that
out new to anybody, probably not.

72
00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.090
But they certainly support those.

73
00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.150
So those are the classic ones.

74
00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.330
The cortex processes
are all their newer ones.

75
00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.290
So you see the cortex processors,

76
00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.750
actually you can see that
they go from bottom to top.

77
00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:24.570
Roughly what bottom to top means in this
chart is it refers to power performance.

78
00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.720
Not just power,
I shouldn't say power because it's not.

79
00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.720
Actually it does relate somewhat to power
consumption but it's performance and

80
00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:30.960
ability features.

81
00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.490
The amount of features that it has.

82
00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:37.150
So the processor at the bottom,
take that green one, that Cortex-M0.

83
00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.000
That thing is their low,
low end processor core.

84
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.510
It has the fewest features,
it's the slowest, and so on.

85
00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.500
Where you scale all the way
up to that Cortex A15,

86
00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.895
in fact they might even be up to, I think
they might have an A17, I can't remember.

87
00:04:48.895 --> 00:04:51.505
But anyway, that's high end.

88
00:04:51.505 --> 00:04:55.425
That type of processor would be used
in laptops and desktops, or tablets, or

89
00:04:55.425 --> 00:04:56.765
something like that, right?

90
00:04:56.765 --> 00:05:00.185
And it's faster, it has lots of memory,
lots of stuff on it.

91
00:05:00.185 --> 00:05:01.845
So they have this sliding scale.

92
00:05:01.845 --> 00:05:05.725
And they categorize those into
embedded and application, right.

93
00:05:05.725 --> 00:05:07.793
The green ones are embedded,
those orangey,

94
00:05:07.793 --> 00:05:10.050
yellow looking ones are our application.

95
00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:12.600
But really I see them,
there's a sliding scale.

96
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.685
So there's not a hard difference between
what they're calling embedded and

97
00:05:15.685 --> 00:05:17.530
what they're calling application.

98
00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.140
It's just they're getting more and
more capability as you go up.

99
00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.800
Now the one that our Broadcom processes,

100
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.130
the Raspberry Pi uses has,
is the Cortex A7.

101
00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:30.200
So I've highlighted that and
circled it in red there.

102
00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:34.172
The Cortex A7 is the one that
our processor's based on,

103
00:05:34.172 --> 00:05:35.760
which is pretty good.

104
00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:36.560
Thank you.

105
00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:45.489
