00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:02.820
So, we're going to talk

2
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.635
a little bit about
the Raspberry Pi,

3
00:00:04.635 --> 00:00:07.305
currently new model of it.

4
00:00:07.305 --> 00:00:08.925
This is actually the newest.

5
00:00:08.925 --> 00:00:12.810
We're going to talk about
the Raspberry Pi 3 B+.

6
00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:15.390
There's also actually
recently now,

7
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:17.550
there are several different
variations of Raspberry Pi.

8
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.445
There's a Raspberry Pi 3 A+,

9
00:00:20.445 --> 00:00:22.320
which is like a smaller version.

10
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.510
But then there's
the Raspberry Pi zero,

11
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.560
which is a really small version.

12
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.670
There's always
different versions,

13
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.530
but this is a common
version right here,

14
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.060
Raspberry Pi 3 B+.

15
00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.990
For this microcontroller, its got

16
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:38.280
a Broadcom BCM2837 system

17
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.030
on chip that is
an ARM-based processor,

18
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:42.850
so there's an ARM
processor in there,

19
00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.770
but that's the SoC
that's made by Broadcom.

20
00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.260
It is not completely open source.

21
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.365
They hide some of
the data sheet detail.

22
00:00:51.365 --> 00:00:53.960
But it is 1.4 gigahertz,

23
00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.410
one gigabyte as SRAM,

24
00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.710
quad core machine,
it's got 40 GPIO pins.

25
00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.635
GPIO standing for
General Purpose Input Output.

26
00:01:03.635 --> 00:01:05.975
So, 40 pins we can use.

27
00:01:05.975 --> 00:01:07.820
It's got four USB ports,

28
00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.895
the older one only had
two way back anyway.

29
00:01:10.895 --> 00:01:15.350
It's got a micro SD card for
its non-volatile memory,

30
00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.120
so it's got a micro SD and

31
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.890
you have to install
the operating system on that.

32
00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.145
It's full-size SD on the
older version, the way older.

33
00:01:25.145 --> 00:01:27.740
It has Bluetooth 4.2,

34
00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.560
which includes BLE,
Bluetooth Low Energy.

35
00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.870
It's got integrated Wi-Fi
on the board as well,

36
00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.750
and power over Ethernet.

37
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.400
Not that it has
Power over Ethernet,

38
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.540
but it's set up for that.

39
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.510
So, if you add
a little bit of hardware,

40
00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.030
you can have Power over Ethernet

41
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.475
which is convenient sometimes.

42
00:01:46.475 --> 00:01:48.970
So, this is what it looks like.

43
00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.690
Actually, it has
the same sort of board layout

44
00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.210
as the older board.

45
00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.075
You can see the USB ports
on the upper right,

46
00:01:57.075 --> 00:02:01.920
Ethernet jack, RJ45 down
there on the lower right.

47
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.690
You'd be probably
using the Wi-Fi,

48
00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.210
but it's got that audio port,

49
00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.485
camera connector, HDMI
for your monitor.

50
00:02:09.485 --> 00:02:11.450
There's a USB connector there,

51
00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.400
but it's for power only.

52
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.050
The USB ports in the right

53
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.020
are for regular
USB communication,

54
00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.250
but ones to lower left,

55
00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.610
that's a power connector,
typically how I power it,

56
00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.320
and there's the processor
and the pins,

57
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.390
you can see
the 40 pins and so on.

58
00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.900
Now, this is the backside
of the board.

59
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.635
The only thing interesting,

60
00:02:28.635 --> 00:02:29.910
the most interesting
thing anyway is

61
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.770
a Micro SD slot, you
can see that there.

62
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.260
That's where you put
the micro SD card

63
00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.540
which you're going to
need because you're going

64
00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.310
to have to have the operating
system on there. Thank you.
