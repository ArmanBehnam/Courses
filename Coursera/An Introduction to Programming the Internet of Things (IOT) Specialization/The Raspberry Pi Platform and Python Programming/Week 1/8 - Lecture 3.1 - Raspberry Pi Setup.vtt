2
00:00:11.316 --> 00:00:15.971
Let's talk a little bit about how to set
up your Raspberry Pi when you first get it

3
00:00:15.971 --> 00:00:17.585
and how you start using it.

4
00:00:17.585 --> 00:00:22.836
Step one, first thing you're gonna
wanna do is plugin the monitor and

5
00:00:22.836 --> 00:00:25.151
plugin a keyboard and a mouse.

6
00:00:25.151 --> 00:00:29.891
That's the easiest way to set this thing
up is to use it as a regular laptop,

7
00:00:29.891 --> 00:00:30.581
desktop.

8
00:00:30.581 --> 00:00:34.518
You can do it other ways, but
this is by far the easiest way to go.

9
00:00:34.518 --> 00:00:39.203
So get a monitor, plug it into
the HDMI and get a keyboard and

10
00:00:39.203 --> 00:00:43.252
a mouse hopefully and
plug them into the USB ports.

11
00:00:43.252 --> 00:00:44.738
Those are your interfaces to the device.

12
00:00:44.738 --> 00:00:48.108
So you'll be able to set it up using
the monitor, keyboard and mouse, so

13
00:00:48.108 --> 00:00:49.115
you start with that.

14
00:00:49.115 --> 00:00:51.723
Then before powering it on,

15
00:00:51.723 --> 00:00:56.841
you need to get an operating
system on the Raspberry Pi.

16
00:00:56.841 --> 00:00:59.850
Now when you get this
Raspberry Pi initially,

17
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.256
it doesn't have an operating
system built into it.

18
00:01:03.256 --> 00:01:06.881
It needs one though,
it needs some operating system to execute.

19
00:01:06.881 --> 00:01:10.047
So now, it has a micro SD card slot.

20
00:01:10.047 --> 00:01:12.012
So you're gonna get a micro SD card and

21
00:01:12.012 --> 00:01:16.321
you're gonna put the operating system onto
that micro SD card, that is your goal.

22
00:01:16.321 --> 00:01:19.956
There are several way to do that,
but that's your goal.

23
00:01:19.956 --> 00:01:23.334
So you need to get the OS
image onto to micro SD.

24
00:01:23.334 --> 00:01:24.297
Now how do you do that?

25
00:01:24.297 --> 00:01:29.195
How you do that depends on what you
got when you bought the Raspberry Pi?

26
00:01:29.195 --> 00:01:32.073
So how do you install
the operating system on there?

27
00:01:32.073 --> 00:01:37.575
So the easiest thing to do is to use
this software, new out of box software.

28
00:01:37.575 --> 00:01:38.993
NOOBS as it's called.

29
00:01:38.993 --> 00:01:43.356
This is from Raspberry Pi,
so it should come bundled.

30
00:01:43.356 --> 00:01:48.022
So if you buy the Raspberry Pi as I did,
it came bundled with an SD card, micro SD.

31
00:01:48.022 --> 00:01:52.560
Then it will be pre-installed on your
micro SD, which is of course, easiest.

32
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.164
If it's not, if you didn't get it
pre-installed on the micro SD,

33
00:01:56.164 --> 00:01:59.341
then you have to buy our micro SD card and
put NOOBS on there.

34
00:01:59.341 --> 00:02:02.235
Now you can download NOOBS,
you got the website up there.

35
00:02:02.235 --> 00:02:07.494
You can download NOOBS from
the Raspberry Pi website.

36
00:02:07.494 --> 00:02:10.034
So if you had to do that,
if it's not pre-installed,

37
00:02:10.034 --> 00:02:13.750
you're gonna have to take your micro SD
card, you're gonna have to format it.

38
00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:14.760
In fact, format is typical.

39
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.609
You're gonna have to format it and for
that, you'll need a SD card reader.

40
00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:25.708
Now some computers, some desktops
have slots just for SD cards.

41
00:02:25.708 --> 00:02:26.927
One of mine doesn't.

42
00:02:26.927 --> 00:02:32.079
So you have to buy a reader, but I think
it cost, I paid 10 bucks for this thing.

43
00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:35.853
For mine, it's a little device,
I put my micro SD in there and

44
00:02:35.853 --> 00:02:39.637
then it has a USB interface and
I plug the USB into my computer.

45
00:02:39.637 --> 00:02:43.496
So you can get something like that or
it might be built-in to your desktop or

46
00:02:43.496 --> 00:02:44.856
laptop, whatever it is.

47
00:02:44.856 --> 00:02:48.778
You plug that into your computer and
then you format the thing.

48
00:02:48.778 --> 00:02:53.095
Once you format it, then you download
NOOBS from the Raspberry Pi website,

49
00:02:53.095 --> 00:02:54.585
you extract its archive.

50
00:02:54.585 --> 00:02:58.717
So basically, if you're on a desktop
you double-click on it, it'll extract.

51
00:02:58.717 --> 00:03:02.080
Hopefully, automatically,
if you have the software built-in or

52
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.096
you'll have to get some
extraction software like 7-Zip.

53
00:03:05.096 --> 00:03:08.555
I don't buy, I get for
free application called 7-Z-I-P.

54
00:03:08.555 --> 00:03:12.594
7-Zip, but you can download that and
extract it and

55
00:03:12.594 --> 00:03:17.282
then you get the image and
then you just put that on the SD card.

56
00:03:17.282 --> 00:03:21.595
So once that's on the micro SD card,
then you have to the micro SD card and

57
00:03:21.595 --> 00:03:23.806
plug that it into your Raspberry Pi.

58
00:03:23.806 --> 00:03:26.906
Now once you plug the micro SD
card into your Raspberry Pi and

59
00:03:26.906 --> 00:03:30.822
then it has the operating system on it,
then you power up the Raspberry Pi.

60
00:03:30.822 --> 00:03:32.505
So you plug it into the power.

61
00:03:32.505 --> 00:03:34.236
Now, NOOBS will start running.

62
00:03:34.236 --> 00:03:38.238
So on the screen, you'll see some text and
images and so on.

63
00:03:38.238 --> 00:03:40.095
But eventually, you'll get NOOBS.

64
00:03:40.095 --> 00:03:43.691
And NOOBS is what you see at the bottom
there is what NOOBS looks like,

65
00:03:43.691 --> 00:03:45.129
the window that it pops up.

66
00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:50.098
So, it pops up a window that basically
gives you a list of choices of operating

67
00:03:50.098 --> 00:03:51.481
systems to install.

68
00:03:51.481 --> 00:03:55.773
Now NOOBS comes with maybe
a couple of operating systems.

69
00:03:55.773 --> 00:03:59.175
Raspian, these are all
Linux distributions.

70
00:03:59.175 --> 00:04:03.512
Raspian, arch,
a bunch of different Linux distributions.

71
00:04:03.512 --> 00:04:05.465
It'll give you a list
of Linux distributions.

72
00:04:05.465 --> 00:04:09.652
Now if you're connected to the network,
it will give you a long list.

73
00:04:09.652 --> 00:04:11.232
Right now, let's assume you're not,

74
00:04:11.232 --> 00:04:13.518
cuz I wanna get to the network
connection activity later.

75
00:04:13.518 --> 00:04:17.008
But if you were connected to the network,
it will give you a long list,

76
00:04:17.008 --> 00:04:21.051
because it will allow you to download
a bunch of different Linux distributions.

77
00:04:21.051 --> 00:04:23.420
But if you're not
connected to the network,

78
00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.609
it will only give you a short list, which
includes the ones that are part NOOBS.

79
00:04:27.609 --> 00:04:29.676
And Raspian is the one
that says recommended,

80
00:04:29.676 --> 00:04:31.161
that's the one you should take.

81
00:04:31.161 --> 00:04:32.194
So go with Raspian.

82
00:04:32.194 --> 00:04:34.819
Raspian is a Linux distribution.

83
00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:37.860
It's a Raspberry Pi version
of the Debian distribution.

84
00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.358
Debian is a popular distribution.

85
00:04:39.358 --> 00:04:41.885
So get Raspian, so select that and

86
00:04:41.885 --> 00:04:47.217
then it'll install it on your micro SD and
so NOOBS is pretty easy to use.

87
00:04:47.217 --> 00:04:52.418
It'll install it, you get a choice,
you select Raspian and that should be it.

88
00:04:52.418 --> 00:04:53.300
Thank you.

89
00:04:53.300 --> 00:05:01.979
