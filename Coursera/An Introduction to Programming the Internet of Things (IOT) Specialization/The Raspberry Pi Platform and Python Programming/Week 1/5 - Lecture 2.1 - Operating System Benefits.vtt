[MUSIC]

2
00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.232
[SOUND] So

3
00:00:11.232 --> 00:00:16.820
the Raspberry Pi has an operating system,
which things like Arduino did not.

4
00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.950
So let's talk a little bit about what
you get from having an operating system.

5
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.160
The first thing you get is
really a user interface.

6
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.010
So Arduino,
it didn't have a real user interface.

7
00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.630
Not native to it.

8
00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.820
So what I mean by that is a user
can't sit at an Arduino and

9
00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.640
do something, not unless you
write a program to that effect.

10
00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.080
But if you just, out of the box,

11
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.806
if you get an Arduino there's
nothing you can do with it.

12
00:00:43.806 --> 00:00:46.280
You can't say, well let me plug
into it and type into it and

13
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.330
write a letter on it or something like
that, right, a user can't use it.

14
00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.450
You have to write code, and
then program it with that code, and

15
00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.910
then that code maybe does something clever
and lets you interact with the device.

16
00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.070
But it's all on you as a programmer
to build that code, right.

17
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.970
Without the code that the programmer
writes, a human can't use the thing.

18
00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.712
It just sits there and
It doesn't do anything right.

19
00:01:06.712 --> 00:01:09.030
Now, if you have an operating system,

20
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.880
the operating system itself
provides a user interface.

21
00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.650
So it gives a way for a user,
a regular user to go sit there and

22
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.930
give commands to the computer and
do basic things, without writing any code.

23
00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.150
The user can just sit there and do things
with a computer and get results out and

24
00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:26.820
they don't have to write any code.

25
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.546
So that's one benefit of
having an operating system.

26
00:01:31.546 --> 00:01:36.122
And this is one reason why
Raspberry Pi can be used in ways that

27
00:01:36.122 --> 00:01:37.753
the Arduino can't.

28
00:01:37.753 --> 00:01:41.633
Now on the other hand if that's what you
want to do maybe you should be using

29
00:01:41.633 --> 00:01:44.650
a laptop or desktop not a Raspberry Pi.

30
00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:50.400
That's another argument, but
you can sit down at a Raspberry Pi and

31
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.980
do things and interact with the machine
without having to write code.

32
00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.818
So the user interface is basically
two types of user interface, oh and

33
00:01:57.818 --> 00:02:00.679
I'll mention that the operating
system that we're

34
00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:03.750
talking about here is some
type of Linux distribution.

35
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.990
Now the next module we'll talk
more fully about Linux and

36
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.410
about the Linux that's running, we expect
to be running on our Raspberry Pi.

37
00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:13.760
But in general,

38
00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.470
Linux operating system you're gonna
get two possible user interfaces okay.

39
00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.470
This is actually true for
any operating system, but

40
00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.320
in Linux it's very prevalent that
people use this text based interface.

41
00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:29.000
So on the left you see the Text-based
interface, really simple interface.

42
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.700
Or simple yet complex.

43
00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.330
Simple in the sense that
the bandwidth is pretty narrow.

44
00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.050
You get a prompt, it says Raspberry Pi or
whatever it says over there.

45
00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.360
And then it says dollar sign.

46
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.320
Then you can type.

47
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.400
So you as a user you type in your command.

48
00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.003
You hit Enter and then it does
whatever the command says right.

49
00:02:46.003 --> 00:02:49.650
If you wanna see the directory,
you would type in the appropriate command.

50
00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.810
It'll show you the contents of the
directory, print them out to the screen,

51
00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:52.840
and that'll be that, okay.

52
00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.880
So that's the Text-based interface,
and so that's one way to go.

53
00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.260
The other way is a Graphic interface,

54
00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.990
a Graphic user interface that
you see over there on the right.

55
00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:06.870
Now a graphic interface, this will
look probably more familiar to people.

56
00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.400
All kinds of operating systems have this.

57
00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.620
This is Linux, one possible
graphics user interface from Linux.

58
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.900
But this is basically similar to
what you would see in a Windows,

59
00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.796
what you would see in a Mac OSX right.

60
00:03:16.796 --> 00:03:18.790
The same type of interface.

61
00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.230
Point and click, you got a mouse,
you click on things, it's graphic right.

62
00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.930
You have icons, all that stuff,
pull down menus, all that.

63
00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.379
So it's a Text-based interface,
no pull down menus, no nothing.

64
00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:33.870
You'll note that this pull down on the top
file edit, but ignore that for a second.

65
00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:34.830
That's not part of the interface,

66
00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.250
the Text-based interface of
the operating system anyway.

67
00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.430
Not in this sense.

68
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.580
So, you just type in your commands and
it prints out the results okay.

69
00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.250
So, there are these two interfaces.

70
00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.870
Now, [COUGH] yes, you type commands
directly into the Text-based and

71
00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.030
use a point click
interface on the graphics.

72
00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.150
Oh, before I go on,
one thing I'd just like to mention is,

73
00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.150
you might ask why should I ever
go with a Text based interface?

74
00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.330
Why not always go with
the graphic interface?

75
00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.490
People are very used to
the graphic interfaces now.

76
00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:12.590
I'll say this, the first reason why
people use the Text-based interface,

77
00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.150
why it's even available,
is because these things started.

78
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:17.790
Linux came from Unix, and

79
00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.350
Unix existed before graphic
user interfaces existed, okay?

80
00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:23.430
So that's part of the reason why.

81
00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.180
When I was an undergrad Text-based was I
mean I they had graphics interface but

82
00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.990
text based is what I used right?

83
00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.710
And it was much more difficult to use the
Graphic interface, especially remotely.

84
00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.710
If you want to use it from home
it was a pain to do the Graphic

85
00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:36.400
interface from home.

86
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.790
You couldn't in a lot of cases.

87
00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:40.140
So you got used to
the Text-based interface.

88
00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:43.180
But another good thing about the
Text-based interface now is that it gives

89
00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:48.320
you more control, that is,
if you can memorize all the commands.

90
00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.460
You can do all kind of things
to the operating system and

91
00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.140
the Graphic user interface,
one thing about a Graphic user interface

92
00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:57.180
even though it's easier to use, it doesn't
present you with all the possibilities.

93
00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.695
Not in a convenient way.

94
00:04:58.695 --> 00:05:02.560
So maybe there is,
the way you can think about an interface.

95
00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.150
When you're making a Graphic user
interface you say look I can only put so

96
00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.665
many things on the screen graphically for
a human to use.

97
00:05:08.665 --> 00:05:13.330
So and the number of things that a human
can do with say Linux is a lot bigger than

98
00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.440
the number of things I can put of
the screen for my Graphic user interface.

99
00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.440
So they have to make a decision.

100
00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.795
They say, look, this 10% of things,
we will put in the screen.

101
00:05:20.795 --> 00:05:23.480
We'll have buttons for it, and
pull downs for it and so forth.

102
00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:27.420
The other 90%, that won't be on the
screen, that won't be in the interface.

103
00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:28.870
And if you want to do that other 90%,

104
00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.690
you have to go through
hoops graphically to do it.

105
00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:33.504
Lots of different complicated routes.

106
00:05:33.504 --> 00:05:35.317
Where with the Text-based interface,

107
00:05:35.317 --> 00:05:38.580
they just, oh all 100% of the features
are just right there for you.

108
00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.905
Now you have to do a decent amount of
memorization because you have to memorize

109
00:05:41.905 --> 00:05:43.060
the commands.

110
00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.684
You can ask for help and
have books open and stuff like that but

111
00:05:45.684 --> 00:05:47.962
it's not convenient unless
you have it memorized.

112
00:05:47.962 --> 00:05:52.015
Now I've been using Linux based machines
for a long time so I have a lot of

113
00:05:52.015 --> 00:05:56.629
the commands memorized, I'm very
comfortable using a Tex-based interface.

114
00:05:56.629 --> 00:06:00.316
But we're gonna mostly in this class
stick with the Graphic interface,

115
00:06:00.316 --> 00:06:03.460
just because it's easier for
people to get acclimated with,

116
00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:07.100
although some things are easier to
do with the Text-based interface.

117
00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.280
And when that's appropriate,
we'll bring that up in the course.

118
00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.120
All right, file system.

119
00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:16.320
So what I'm showing here is a way that
you might access the file system.

120
00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:17.240
You've seen this okay.

121
00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:18.700
You've seen something like this.

122
00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:24.300
This is, using the Graphic user
interface that comes on Raspberry Pi and

123
00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:27.870
is Linux, this is its file system
interface, what it looks like.

124
00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:31.280
You see a bunch of folders,
you can double-click and see files.

125
00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.129
This type of thing you're used to right.

126
00:06:33.129 --> 00:06:37.050
You've seen this on any Windows or
Mac OS or whatever.

127
00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:39.390
So, this and
you also get the same thing with Linux.

128
00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:41.570
So, you can use this interface too.

129
00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:45.495
But you don't have to,
you can use Text-based but

130
00:06:45.495 --> 00:06:48.970
this is convenient and
people are used to it.

131
00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:53.921
Sharing is very similar, you can create
files, directories, that sort of thing.

132
00:06:53.921 --> 00:06:54.504
Thank you.

133
00:06:54.504 --> 00:07:01.504
