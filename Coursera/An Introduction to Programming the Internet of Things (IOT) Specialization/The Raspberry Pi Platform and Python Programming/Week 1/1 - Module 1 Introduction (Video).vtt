2
00:00:10.921 --> 00:00:15.214
So the first module of this course
is gonna be introducing you to

3
00:00:15.214 --> 00:00:16.510
the Raspberry Pi.

4
00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.910
The Raspberry Pi is another board,
a development board.

5
00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.671
It's similar, related to the Arduino.

6
00:00:22.671 --> 00:00:25.660
It's not that similar and
we'll talk about the differences.

7
00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.447
So the Raspberry Pi basically has
more features built into it, and

8
00:00:28.447 --> 00:00:31.220
we'll talk about some of those features.

9
00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.110
And we'll compare it to the Arduino.

10
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.530
It's also used to make IoT devices,
but it has other capabilities as well.

11
00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.260
We'll talk about the fact that it's
faster, more memory, that sort of thing.

12
00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.560
But more relevant is that it
has an operating system, and

13
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.770
that really changes the way in
which you use the Raspberry Pi.

14
00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.640
So we'll talk about that and
what you get out of an operating system.

15
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.650
Why does that enhance the abilities
of what you can do with the device.

16
00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.340
So we'll talk about that and
we'll compare it to the Arduino.

17
00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.088
And will show you the board, show you the
different things it has on it and give you

18
00:01:01.088 --> 00:01:04.693
an idea of what the capabilities are on
a Raspberry Pi compared to an Arduino.

19
00:01:04.693 --> 00:01:05.831
Thank you.
