2
00:00:11.406 --> 00:00:16.013
A question one could ask about
a Raspberry Pi given all that we've

3
00:00:16.013 --> 00:00:21.138
learned about it is, isn't a Raspberry Pi
device really an IoT device?

4
00:00:21.138 --> 00:00:23.560
Would you consider it to
be Internet of Things?

5
00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.880
So maybe is the answer to that and

6
00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.030
that is basically depending on
how the Raspberry Pi it used.

7
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:31.300
So similarities,

8
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.950
reason why you might say Raspberry Pi
device is similar to an IoT device.

9
00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:40.330
Look it has network intelligence,
which you need for IoT.

10
00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.770
It has computational intelligence,
network connectivity,

11
00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.730
computational intelligence, meaning it's
a processor that talks on a network.

12
00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:52.200
It's small and cheap, that's classic,
very common inside an IoT device.

13
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.660
It's cheap relative to a full-on PC or
laptop, desktop, something like that and

14
00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.629
they're pretty small, it's not
super small, but it's pretty small.

15
00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.424
Pretty cheap and it can interface with
sensors and actuators directly via pins,

16
00:01:05.424 --> 00:01:05.928
right?

17
00:01:05.928 --> 00:01:11.110
Just like Arduino can and
just like other IoT devices do.

18
00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:16.120
So, in those senses, you can say look,
this thing can be an IoT device.

19
00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.870
Now, differences between a Raspberry Pi,
is that you could

20
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:25.740
use it In just like a laptop or desktop,
you can use it exactly in that way.

21
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.980
The interface can be exactly the same
as any old PC running Linux on it.

22
00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.370
So the complexities and
how does that make it not as a IoT device?

23
00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:35.450
What happens there is,

24
00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.360
the complexities of the system
become visible to the user, right?

25
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.560
So the user can sit down there and
interact with the computer

26
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.920
with the Raspberry Pi, just like
you would with a laptop or desktop.

27
00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.328
See all the details, right?

28
00:01:46.328 --> 00:01:51.297
What's one of the beauties of an IoT
device is you don't see the complexities

29
00:01:51.297 --> 00:01:51.989
as a user.

30
00:01:51.989 --> 00:01:54.130
As a user, you know it's a simple device.

31
00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.400
You're driving a car,
you don't see all the complexities,

32
00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.230
the processing going on in the car.

33
00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.120
You just hit the car pedal and
turn the steering wheel.

34
00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.550
And you get the benefits of
the processing without having to deal with

35
00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:05.750
the complexities.

36
00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.250
When you sync that Raspberry Pi and if
you've got it plugged into a monitor and

37
00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.700
keyboard, then you're actually
seeing the complexities.

38
00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.140
You have to install software on it,

39
00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.140
update drivers, all the stuff that
you have to do with a desktop or

40
00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.570
laptop, you would have to do,
could have to do with a Raspberry Pi.

41
00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.560
So if, so
when I say maybe it's an IoT device.

42
00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.940
If you're using the Raspberry Pi
like a laptop or

43
00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.930
desktop, meaning you're sitting at it with
a keyboard, and a mouse, and a screen.

44
00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.970
And working with it just like you would
work with any desktop PC desktop or

45
00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.080
laptop, then I would say no.

46
00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.969
It's not an IoT device,
it's just a substitute for a laptop.

47
00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:47.181
But, you can also use it in such
a way where you are not actually

48
00:02:47.181 --> 00:02:49.938
interacting with it directly, right?

49
00:02:49.938 --> 00:02:52.679
So if you say look instead of using
it in this way I'm gonna take

50
00:02:52.679 --> 00:02:53.575
the Raspberry Pi and

51
00:02:53.575 --> 00:02:56.919
I will connect it to a bunch of sensors,
connect it to a bunch of actuators.

52
00:02:56.919 --> 00:02:59.788
And then rather then
sitting at a keyboard and

53
00:02:59.788 --> 00:03:05.239
typing text directly into the Raspberry Pi
I just interact with the sensors, right?

54
00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.820
Maybe there's a push button and
potentiometer, something like that.

55
00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:09.830
I interact with those and

56
00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.280
then the Raspberry Pi makes
something happen with the actuators.

57
00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.410
Then I'm using it as an IoT device,
because I'm not directly interacting with

58
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.002
the processor, I'm interacting
with the sensors and actuators.

59
00:03:21.002 --> 00:03:24.640
All right, so I'm one step removed, then
you would say, yes it's an IoT device.

60
00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.990
So Raspberry Pi can be used as an IoT
device, but it doesn't have to be,

61
00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:32.260
it could be used as a desktop,
laptop system, albeit a slow one, right?

62
00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.948
So, compared to your standard desktop,
laptop,

63
00:03:35.948 --> 00:03:39.649
it's fairly slow,
it doesn't have much memory.

64
00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:43.569
I mean, it has some memory, but compared
to a desktop, laptop, not a lot, right?

65
00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:48.095
So you could use it in that way but you
can also use it as an IoT device which is

66
00:03:48.095 --> 00:03:52.929
how we'll basically, we'll talk about
both really in the specialization.

67
00:03:52.929 --> 00:03:53.849
Thank you.

68
00:03:53.849 --> 00:04:01.265
