2
00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:16.210
The first time you boot up your
Raspberry Pi after you've installed our

3
00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:18.466
Raspi operating system on there.

4
00:00:18.466 --> 00:00:19.707
The first time you boot it up,

5
00:00:19.707 --> 00:00:22.770
you're gonna get a screen that
looks like what you see here.

6
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.459
That's running a tool,
it's showing a tool called Raspi-Config.

7
00:00:26.459 --> 00:00:27.890
It's a configuration tool.

8
00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.815
This'll pop up the first time you boot.

9
00:00:30.815 --> 00:00:31.475
But also,

10
00:00:31.475 --> 00:00:35.975
you can run it yourself later on if you
want to, to change configuration options.

11
00:00:35.975 --> 00:00:37.175
But the first time it pops up.

12
00:00:37.175 --> 00:00:39.485
And so you get something like
what you see down there.

13
00:00:39.485 --> 00:00:44.797
And it gives you a bunch of setup options
for the raspi in operating system.

14
00:00:44.797 --> 00:00:46.107
So it runs automatically.

15
00:00:46.107 --> 00:00:47.582
And you can see the options.

16
00:00:47.582 --> 00:00:49.877
We're gonna go through
some of these options,

17
00:00:49.877 --> 00:00:52.877
to give you an idea of whether you want
to set how you want to set these things.

18
00:00:52.877 --> 00:00:55.897
You're getting all this
first times if you want to.

19
00:00:55.897 --> 00:00:57.817
But let's just go through
some of these options.

20
00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.190
So, expand file system.

21
00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.680
That's the first one that reformats your
micro SD to use the rest of their memory.

22
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.380
So what happens is, you first do it.

23
00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.640
When you first install,
maybe your micro SD card has a lot.

24
00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.560
Maybe you got a big one, 16 gig or
something like that or bigger, a 16 gig.

25
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.500
But it won't use that with
the initial configuration.

26
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.370
When you install the operating
system it give you the space.

27
00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:24.680
It uses up space for
the operating system plus a little more.

28
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.800
You won't even see the rest of the card,
right?

29
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.850
So there'll be lots of memory
on the card that you can't use,

30
00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.020
cuz you can't see from
the Linux file system.

31
00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.650
So if you click on Expand Filesystem, it
reformats it so you can use all the memory

32
00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.050
on the micro SD, which is a good idea.

33
00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:43.110
Change user password.

34
00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.440
So change user password
does just what it says.

35
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.200
So one thing to mention is that
this operating system, Linux.

36
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.200
It has users.

37
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.390
Different users can log in.

38
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.401
So you have to type in.

39
00:01:52.401 --> 00:01:55.129
When you start up, you have to
type in a username and a password.

40
00:01:55.129 --> 00:01:59.103
And the username, the one account that
it creates is the pi account, p i,

41
00:01:59.103 --> 00:02:00.400
that's the username.

42
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.410
And it comes up with a password.

43
00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.620
The default password for
that account is raspberry.

44
00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:06.910
But you can change that if you want to.

45
00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:08.905
So change user password
you can do at this stage.

46
00:02:11.528 --> 00:02:15.040
The next item is to enable
boot to desktop/scratch.

47
00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.490
So what this is,
is that it's what happens when you boot.

48
00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.030
So when you boot this is determining
what type of interface you get for

49
00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.370
the operating system at boot time.

50
00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.650
So there are three options they give you.

51
00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.600
Desktop, this could be
console desktop scratch.

52
00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.520
Console is what you see
at the bottom left.

53
00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.930
Just the straight text-based
interface that we've seen before,

54
00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.280
we already talked about.

55
00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.800
That would be console.

56
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.860
Purely text-based.

57
00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.380
The next option is desktop.

58
00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.420
Desktop is the graphic interface
that you see bottom right.

59
00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.640
And that's what you would be used to with
your standard operating systems, okay?

60
00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.070
And I probably recommend that one.

61
00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:53.570
The next one is Scratch.

62
00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.280
Scratch is a programming environment for
kids, let's not use that.

63
00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.850
It's fine, but
my kids have already outgrown it.

64
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.480
It's not necessary,
I don't think, for our purposes.

65
00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.870
So it's nice for a kid,
you know, it's nice for

66
00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.920
a kid to learn programming first time.

67
00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.540
But I'm thinking we're beyond that,
so don't use that.

68
00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.680
But using the desktop We use console.

69
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.520
Now for us, I'm going to assume,
we're mostly going to go with desktop.

70
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.609
Okay, we're gonna go with
the graphical user interface.

71
00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:22.211
You need the console option too.

72
00:03:22.211 --> 00:03:25.240
But from the graphical user interface,
you can invoke the console.

73
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.100
So graphical user interface option,
the desktop option is usually the best.

74
00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.350
And then you can open a console
whenever you want to.

75
00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.520
Whereas, if you just go with console,
all you see is the console.

76
00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.949
So that's what I'm assuming
we're going to be doing.

77
00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.910
The desktop graphic userface
may not be necessary, right,

78
00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.139
depends on how you're
using this raspberry pi.

79
00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:47.678
If you're using this raspberry
pi as part of an IOT device.

80
00:03:47.678 --> 00:03:51.091
Then you probably don't want
the user interacting directly with

81
00:03:51.091 --> 00:03:52.090
the raspberry pi.

82
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:53.960
So you don't need the desktop option.

83
00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:58.737
All right, that just a regular old
console would be fine in that case.

84
00:03:58.737 --> 00:04:01.755
So there are cases where
you don't need to desktop.

85
00:04:01.755 --> 00:04:05.670
But for us we're pretty much gonna
use a desktop to make things easier.

86
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.330
The next selection would be
Internationalisation and Rastrack.

87
00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.640
So internationalisation is basically
setting up all these options.

88
00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.790
So default is set up for use in the US.

89
00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:18.320
So you change things.

90
00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.220
You can change the language.

91
00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.120
You can change the timezone,
which you have to do in the US also.

92
00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.398
You can change the keyboard layout
if you want to, things like that.

93
00:04:28.398 --> 00:04:30.163
I didn't change any of those,
just so you know.

94
00:04:30.163 --> 00:04:34.215
But I'm in the US,
all of that stuff was fine for me.

95
00:04:34.215 --> 00:04:37.885
Rastrack is just a service that allows
Raspberry Pi users to find other

96
00:04:37.885 --> 00:04:38.895
Raspberry Pi users.

97
00:04:38.895 --> 00:04:43.765
So it gives, it distributes your location,
your IP address,

98
00:04:43.765 --> 00:04:46.445
and from the IP address
it infers the location.

99
00:04:46.445 --> 00:04:49.156
That's completely optional and I did
not select that, but that's up to you.

100
00:04:49.156 --> 00:04:51.335
Thank you.

101
00:04:51.335 --> 00:04:59.194
