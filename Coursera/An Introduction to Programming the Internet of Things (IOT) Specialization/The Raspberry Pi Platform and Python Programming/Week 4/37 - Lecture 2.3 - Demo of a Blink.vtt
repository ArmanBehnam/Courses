2
00:00:11.768 --> 00:00:15.019
Today, we are going to make an LED blink.

3
00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:17.921
So, we're gonna run,
on our Raspberry Pi here.

4
00:00:17.921 --> 00:00:20.260
We're gonna run a program, blink program.

5
00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:21.940
It's the program that
you saw in Lecture 2.1,

6
00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.500
that blink program, slightly modified.

7
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.810
I will talk about the modifications
after we put this circuit together.

8
00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.150
But right now let's just show and
talk about what we have and

9
00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:33.210
the circuit we're gonna make.

10
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.812
We're just gonna blink
an led using the GPIO,

11
00:00:35.812 --> 00:00:38.087
general purpose IO on the Raspberry Pi.

12
00:00:38.087 --> 00:00:40.623
So here's my Raspberry Pi, the B+.

13
00:00:40.623 --> 00:00:43.290
These are the GPIO pins right along here.

14
00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.080
Right now, in my Raspberry Pi,
I have plugged in the HDMI and

15
00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.937
also have the power plugged in.

16
00:00:49.937 --> 00:00:51.655
You can see the red light.

17
00:00:51.655 --> 00:00:57.923
I've also got my USB for
my wireless keyboard and mouse.

18
00:00:57.923 --> 00:00:59.039
Also, I've got my Wi-Fi.

19
00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.836
You don't need that right now,
but I have it plugged in.

20
00:01:01.836 --> 00:01:05.899
Now, I've got my breadboard for making the
circuit, I've got an LED and a resistor.

21
00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:10.640
I'm using a 1 k resistor, but
that's not really that important.

22
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.249
I mean it can be plus or minus but
I'm using 1 k, one kilohm.

23
00:01:14.249 --> 00:01:15.970
I got a couple of wires.

24
00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.160
Also, I've got this,
now this wire, this I'm using.

25
00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.570
You'll notice this wire is three
wires put together really.

26
00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.160
It's a servo cable, but
it's got three holes in there.

27
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.400
So this is female, right?

28
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.670
It's got three holes on each side.

29
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.165
And we need that because
the GPIO pins here are male.

30
00:01:33.165 --> 00:01:36.480
They're leads that
are protruding straight out.

31
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.240
In order for us to connect to those
we need something with holes in it.

32
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.290
So, we need this,
this thing just is an adapter so

33
00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:45.940
we can end up connecting to the board.

34
00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.580
This is different than the Arduino.

35
00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.770
If you remember the Arduino,
these general purpose IO were all female.

36
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.550
They were holes you could stick
these leads straight into them, but

37
00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.110
it's a little different here.

38
00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.200
Now let me wire together the circuit and
it's pretty easy.

39
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.428
This is actually exactly the same as what
we did with the Arduino when we blinked

40
00:02:07.428 --> 00:02:08.080
its light.

41
00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:14.500
So we take the LED, plug its anode and
cathode into two different rows.

42
00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.730
That should be fine.

43
00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.165
Then we'll take the resistor,
plug that in in series.

44
00:02:20.165 --> 00:02:23.600
Oh, this is the same row here.

45
00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.220
And plug the other lead into another row.

46
00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.880
Okay.

47
00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.100
Okay, so we got that wired together.

48
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.650
Now, let's plug in our cable
into our Raspberry Pi.

49
00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.909
Now what we're gonna do is we're
gonna use pins six and eight, really.

50
00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.340
Okay, let's count off these pins.

51
00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:46.940
We're using the board numbering.

52
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.310
So they're numbered starting here.

53
00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.450
One, two, three, four,
five, six, and so on.

54
00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.500
Now, it turns out pin six is a ground and

55
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.520
pin eight is the pin that
we're going to use for GPIO.

56
00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.490
So we need the ground cuz we need to
connect the ground to this circuit.

57
00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:08.077
So we're going to take this, plug it into
the three pins, pins six, eight, and ten.

58
00:03:08.077 --> 00:03:15.090
So pins, six is black,
red is eight, and white is ten.

59
00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.872
We're going to use those.

60
00:03:16.872 --> 00:03:20.306
We're gonna take the ground,
which I have connected to black,

61
00:03:20.306 --> 00:03:24.220
and take that,
plug this into the black on this end.

62
00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.671
And we're gonna plug that into our
circuit onto one end of this resistor.

63
00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:33.514
There we go.

64
00:03:33.514 --> 00:03:35.034
Oh, I got it in the wrong row.

65
00:03:35.034 --> 00:03:35.930
Move it up one row.

66
00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:38.130
There.

67
00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.070
Okay, so we got that.

68
00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.684
Now we're gonna use pin eight.

69
00:03:43.684 --> 00:03:45.937
GPIO8, which is the red.

70
00:03:45.937 --> 00:03:48.920
We're gonna connect that to
the other side of the LED.

71
00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.805
We'll take that,
plug the yellow wire into that and

72
00:03:51.805 --> 00:03:56.060
plug that into the outside of the LED,
the anode of the LED.

73
00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.170
Okay so now it's wired up.

74
00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.370
So now we're gonna run our program.

75
00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.110
Now, to let you know about the program,
the slight modifications.

76
00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:09.270
So the program in Lecture 2.1, the blink
program, it actually used pin 13.

77
00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:15.234
We're using pin 8, so
I changed that to 8 instead of 13.

78
00:04:15.234 --> 00:04:18.733
Also the sleep time,
in the program on Lecture 2.1,

79
00:04:18.733 --> 00:04:20.899
we used a one-second sleep time.

80
00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:23.836
We're using a 0.5-second sleep time so
it blinks a little faster.

81
00:04:23.836 --> 00:04:24.720
Every half second it blinks.

82
00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.580
So, that's it, that should be
all wired up and ready to go.

83
00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.560
Now, what we're gonna do,
one thing you can't see is the keyboard.

84
00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.410
So, I have a keyboard
connect to my Raspberry Pi.

85
00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.470
And I am going to start
running the program.

86
00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.500
Now the program, I call it Blink.py.

87
00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.790
Dot py, it's a typical suffix for
Python programs.

88
00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.570
So I have a program called Blink.py, and

89
00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.125
it's basically what I told
you about in Lecture 2.1.

90
00:04:49.125 --> 00:04:53.953
Now, I've typed that in and to execute it
I would only type python3 Blink.py, but

91
00:04:53.953 --> 00:04:57.149
remember that since I'm using
GPIO I need to be in root,

92
00:04:57.149 --> 00:04:59.000
I need to have root permission.

93
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.548
So I am going to put pseudo before that,
so I'm typing pseudo python3 Blink.py.

94
00:05:04.548 --> 00:05:07.682
I'm just going to hit execute on it,
and hit Enter on there.

95
00:05:07.682 --> 00:05:09.598
And it should be blinking.

96
00:05:09.598 --> 00:05:11.409
Yes, it is.

97
00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:13.127
Indeed, and there it is.

98
00:05:13.127 --> 00:05:15.566
And that is how we blink
an LED with Raspberry Pi.

99
00:05:15.566 --> 00:05:17.469
It's pretty straightforward to make.

100
00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:26.519
