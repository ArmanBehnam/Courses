00:00:11.443 --> 00:00:16.270
Module four is about using Python to
control the hardware in the Raspberry Pi.

3
00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.967
Now, a lot of this hardware control is
stuff that we've seen in the Arduino

4
00:00:21.967 --> 00:00:22.615
already.

5
00:00:22.615 --> 00:00:27.079
When we looked through the Arduino we
talked about how you write a C or C + +

6
00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:31.910
sketch to control the GPIO and to make
things happen inside of the Raspberry Pi.

7
00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:33.670
How do you get pulse
with modulation working?

8
00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.400
How do you get I2C working?

9
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.180
Things like this using C.

10
00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.010
We did this in Arduino.

11
00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.330
Now, with Raspberry Pi we're gonna do
a lot of the same things in Python.

12
00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.580
So we just gonna talk about how in
Python do you use Python code to control

13
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.180
the general purpose IO and

14
00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.630
the other functionalities on the Raspberry
Pi that directly control hardware.

15
00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.800
Also, so
a lot of this is gonna be replicating

16
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.490
stuff that we already did in Arduino,
we'll just be doing it in Raspberry Pi.

17
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:07.170
But also we'll touch on some stuff
that you can't do in Arduino.

18
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.960
Because we have an operating
system in Raspberry Pi, and so

19
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.880
that gives you the possibility
to do a lot of other things.

20
00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.809
And so we'll look at that, we'll look
at for instance graphic user interface,

21
00:01:15.809 --> 00:01:17.000
we'll touch on that.

22
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.837
Graphic user interface is supported by an
operating system, so you can use a graphic

23
00:01:20.837 --> 00:01:24.414
user interface and control the hardware
through it, or something like that.

24
00:01:24.414 --> 00:01:25.853
And we'll talk about that too.

25
00:01:25.853 --> 00:01:26.434
Thank you.
