00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:14.704
In module three,
the point is to learn about Python,

3
00:00:14.704 --> 00:00:16.808
the programming language Python.

4
00:00:16.808 --> 00:00:20.724
The reason why we're talking about that
language is because Python is the best

5
00:00:20.724 --> 00:00:23.470
supported language for
programming in Raspberry Pi.

6
00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.648
You can program in several languages,
but it's best supported for

7
00:00:26.648 --> 00:00:27.996
controlling the hardware.

8
00:00:27.996 --> 00:00:31.556
There are lots of APIs that are nice and
easy to use in Python.

9
00:00:31.556 --> 00:00:35.914
So we're gonna use Python and
we use Python Interpreter.

10
00:00:35.914 --> 00:00:40.830
Basically, this whole module is just
to learn about the basics of Python.

11
00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.850
Really, most of it is independent
from the Raspberry Pi.

12
00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.250
Now, we'll talk about how do you invoke
Python from your Raspberry Pi, right?

13
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.218
We'll start with that.

14
00:00:48.218 --> 00:00:50.299
But then we're just gonna
talk about the rules,

15
00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:52.040
the basics of Python coding in general.

16
00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:54.070
And that's it.

17
00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:54.716
Thank you.
