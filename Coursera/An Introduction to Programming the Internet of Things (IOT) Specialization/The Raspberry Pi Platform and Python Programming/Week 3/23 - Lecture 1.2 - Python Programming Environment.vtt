2
00:00:12.094 --> 00:00:16.788
When you program, you need to program in
some kind of a programming environment

3
00:00:16.788 --> 00:00:19.100
that roughly means the Arduino IDE, so

4
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.730
with Arduino earlier on in this
specialization, we used the Arduino IDE.

5
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:24.987
So that's a programming environment.

6
00:00:24.987 --> 00:00:29.553
Basically, that minimally entails some
kind of a text editor where you can

7
00:00:29.553 --> 00:00:31.350
type your code in.

8
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.780
Also either a compiler or
interpreter based on the language.

9
00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.588
With Python, we'd be looking for
an interpreter of some kind.

10
00:00:37.588 --> 00:00:42.126
So that's sort of minimally what
a programming environment involves.

11
00:00:42.126 --> 00:00:44.281
So, with this Raspberry Pi,

12
00:00:44.281 --> 00:00:50.750
we've got basically two types of
programming environments that we can use.

13
00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.583
One is some IDE,
integrated development environment.

14
00:00:53.583 --> 00:00:58.183
So an IDE is basically one tool that puts
the text editor and the interpreter and

15
00:00:58.183 --> 00:01:01.260
other things you might need
together into one tool.

16
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.210
Like the Arduino IDE,
that was an IDE, right?

17
00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:06.370
Integrated development environment.

18
00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:07.390
People like IDEs.

19
00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.940
There are several IDEs you can use,
Eclipse is a common one for

20
00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.480
free, there are a lot of IDEs.

21
00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:19.550
So you can use an IDE, or, oh, and for
us, since we're doing this in Python,

22
00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.598
the IDE that we will end up using is IDLE,
I-D-L-E.

23
00:01:22.598 --> 00:01:25.550
That's a default IDE with Python,
the first one.

24
00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.100
When you get Python installed
on any machine it has IDLE.

25
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.830
IDLE's a nice simple IDE, it's convenient.

26
00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.980
So you can use an IDE or, oh,

27
00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.900
well actually, first how you invoke IDLE,
if you wanna invoke that.

28
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.000
You can go a menu, so
if you look in at, so

29
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.530
I'm assuming right now that
you got a Raspberry Pi.

30
00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.400
And you got the desktop running, right?

31
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.600
So you got the graphic interface.

32
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.550
Up in the upper left hand
corner there's a Menu button.

33
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.987
So if you go to Menu >
Programming > Python,

34
00:01:51.987 --> 00:01:56.720
there'll actually be two options there,
there's Python 2 and Python 3.

35
00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.430
Go for
Python 3 cuz that's what we want to run.

36
00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.120
So you select that and
that'll start the IDLE IDE.

37
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.620
Now, if you don't happen
to wanna use an IDE for

38
00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.100
some reason, I recommend an IDE for
now, but if you don't wanna use an IDE,

39
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:15.330
another way to do is to use a text
editor and an interpreter separately.

40
00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.180
So you can run any old text editor like
Nano or Pico like we used earlier.

41
00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:26.140
You can open that up, type in your code,
save it, then after you saved it

42
00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.760
and my example I'm calling it test.py, .py
is a common suffix for Python programs.

43
00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.930
So let's say I call it test.py
when I save it in my directory.

44
00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.250
Then in the terminal, in my shell,
I can type Python 3 test.py and

45
00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.170
that will execute the script.

46
00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.280
So that's another way to go about it.

47
00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.820
You can just use the tools,
you can use them integrated in IDLE,

48
00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.405
an IDE like IDLE, or
you can use the two things separately.

49
00:02:49.405 --> 00:02:52.675
Any text editor you want
plus the interpreter.

50
00:02:52.675 --> 00:02:55.815
We're going to, throughout this module,
anyway, we're going to use IDLE,

51
00:02:55.815 --> 00:02:57.595
we're gonna assume the use of IDLE.

52
00:02:57.595 --> 00:03:01.990
Of course, sometimes it's useful to
do the separate text editor method,

53
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.440
because that allows you to get into
super user mode sometimes, so for

54
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.430
some things,
we'll see this in the next module.

55
00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.990
There's some programs where you need to

56
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.900
have permissions as root to
actually execute the code and for

57
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.970
that you need sudo, s-u-d-o,
sudo command at the command line.

58
00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.650
So for that it'll be useful to do
separately at the command line but

59
00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.090
now let's assume that we're using IDLE.

60
00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.334
So we assume we're using IDLE and
we're using Python 3.

61
00:03:28.334 --> 00:03:32.392
All right, so IDLE, so
say you want to execute Python code,

62
00:03:32.392 --> 00:03:37.100
you want to execute it, there
are basically two ways to execute code.

63
00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.490
In IDLE, actually in general.

64
00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.200
Execute Python code, specifically.

65
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.650
You don't have this option with a C or
a compiled language, but in Python you do.

66
00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.960
You have interactive or
what I'll call batch.

67
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.490
Interactive is where you type in
the lines of code one at a time.

68
00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:55.890
And so
that's what you're seeing at the top left,

69
00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.910
that window that you see
in the top of the slide.

70
00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.130
That's showing an interactive mode,
right, in IDLE.

71
00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.170
It's showing IDLE's interactive window,
and there's a prompt that's circled there.

72
00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:09.320
And that prompt is just saying look,
after this prompt you can type.

73
00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.360
So you type in whatever the Python command
is that you wanna execute, you hit Enter,

74
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.160
and it will execute that command and
print out any results.

75
00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.000
And then it'll give you a new prompt,
okay?

76
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.460
It's like a little terminal.

77
00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:20.380
It's like a shell.

78
00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.230
In fact, it is a shell just for
executing Python code.

79
00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:25.290
So that's the interactive way.

80
00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:29.390
Now, that's convenient for
trying things out,

81
00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:34.080
but eventually, you wanna write a big
piece of code and run it all at once.

82
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.570
So after you tweaked it and

83
00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:38.980
tuned it, then you wanna run it all at
once, as a traditional program would.

84
00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.510
So that would be batch mode,
and with that,

85
00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.850
you just write the whole
program in one file, and

86
00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.020
then you just execute that whole thing,
and I'll show you how to do that too.

87
00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.870
We'll be doing both.

88
00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.650
Mostly we'll be going with batch, but

89
00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.750
interactive is useful just
to experiment with things.

90
00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.970
So if you wanna do interactive
execution you need a Python shell.

91
00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:58.450
So how do you get a Python shell?

92
00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:00.920
If you start IDLE, the shell is default.

93
00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.070
The window that opens is the shell.

94
00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:05.180
That's what you see up in the window
that you see on top of the slide.

95
00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.510
That's basically the window that you get.

96
00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:08.260
Something that looks like that.

97
00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:12.110
So just start IDLE and
you'll get an interactive shell.

98
00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.010
And you can type in your instructions.

99
00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:19.570
Now, if you want to do that and get
an interactive shell, Python Shell, and

100
00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:23.200
you want to do that from the terminal
window at the command line,

101
00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.540
then you would just type Python 3.

102
00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:28.150
And it'll start an interactive shell for
you right there in the terminal.

103
00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.979
In LX terminal, rather,
if you're using that terminal window.

104
00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:35.778
Okay so, let's say you wanna
execute entire programs

105
00:05:35.778 --> 00:05:37.500
in batch mode in IDLE, right?

106
00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.240
So you wanna, instead of just executing
one line at a time that you type in,

107
00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.190
you wanna write a whole
lot of lines of code and

108
00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:44.500
then just execute them, and
you wanna use IDLE to do that.

109
00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:48.150
So, what you do is, you start IDLE.

110
00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.520
Then you make a new file.

111
00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:52.560
So, File > New File,

112
00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:57.060
it creates a new window like the one that
you see here up in the top of the slide.

113
00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.470
And in that window,
you can type in your code.

114
00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:00.640
So you type in your lines of code.

115
00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.620
Now I got a few sample
lines of code there,

116
00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:05.460
from some random program
that I wrote at some point.

117
00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:08.200
So you type in your lines of code.

118
00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:12.000
Then, once you type them in,
then when you wanna run it,

119
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.540
you select Run under that highlight
that I've circled in red.

120
00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:18.380
You select Run > Run Module.

121
00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:19.980
Run module is an option under there.

122
00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:21.780
And that will interpret it and
start running it.

123
00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:25.200
So that will pop open a Python shell and

124
00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:26.890
it will execute that
code inside the shell.

125
00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:33.229
So that's how you run batch mode programs
in IDLE, and we'll be doing that a lot.

126
00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:33.998
Thank you.

127
00:06:33.998 --> 00:06:42.939
