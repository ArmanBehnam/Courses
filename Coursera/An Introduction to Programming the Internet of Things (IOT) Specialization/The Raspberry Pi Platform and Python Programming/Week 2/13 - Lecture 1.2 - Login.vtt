Module 2, Lesson 1 Lecture 1.2: Login.

3
00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.605
Linux machines have kind
of a number of accounts,

4
00:00:17.605 --> 00:00:21.020
[COUGH] just like other operating systems,
it's a common feature.

5
00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.760
They have a number of user accounts.

6
00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.700
Now, each user account has associated
with it a username and a password for

7
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.100
identification and authentication.

8
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.500
So when you first start the machine,

9
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.630
you're prompted for
a username and a password.

10
00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.730
Now the default patent username,

11
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.180
the account that it gives
you by default is pi.

12
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.720
That's the name of it, so
that'll be the username.

13
00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.920
And the password,
default password is raspberry,

14
00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.990
which you can change,
we saw through the raspberry config.

15
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.750
So, you start off,
that's a login process right there,

16
00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.330
where you give the username and
the password, and it logs you in.

17
00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:02.660
Now, first command we'll talk about in the
command line is man page, a man command.

18
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.730
Getting manual pages, or
man pages, people call them.

19
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.854
So, there are whole lot of commands
in a Linux or Unix environment, and

20
00:01:09.854 --> 00:01:13.708
you won't necessarily remember
all of them all the time.

21
00:01:13.708 --> 00:01:17.160
So often you're at a machine and
you know the name of the command but

22
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.680
you don't remember how exactly
how to use that command.

23
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.890
Right, because these commands have lots
of options on that you can add to them.

24
00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.530
And you, maybe you don't remember
an option or something like that.

25
00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.550
So you type man and
the name of the command at the prompt, so

26
00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.810
you can see up there, I say pwd.

27
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.590
I know there's a command pwd,
but I forgot what it does.

28
00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.634
So to find out, I type man pwd, hit Enter,
and then what'll appear is the screen

29
00:01:40.634 --> 00:01:43.680
will change and it will immediately
become what you see at the bottom.

30
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.420
Which, this is just the beginning of it,
but it's the man page.

31
00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.170
It's a description of the command.

32
00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.740
There's a name of the command,
its synopsis,

33
00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.650
its description,
gives you all its options, all that.

34
00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.063
So that will appear on the screen, I'm
just showing you the top part of it, but

35
00:01:57.063 --> 00:01:58.528
the man pages can be pretty long.

36
00:01:58.528 --> 00:02:04.810
So, there are man pages available for
all of the Unix and Linux commands.

37
00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.655
So, you can find out by a command
that way by using its man page, and

38
00:02:08.655 --> 00:02:11.211
that's a helpful feature
a lot of the time.

39
00:02:11.211 --> 00:02:14.760
So, it gives information
about some Linux command.

40
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.840
And that used to be the only
source of information you had.

41
00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.660
But now you got the network,
you can also Google, right?

42
00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.930
You can just Google something and
ask it for help.

43
00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.330
But man pages are really useful,

44
00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.281
just sort of a local store of
information about the operating system.

45
00:02:30.281 --> 00:02:38.569
