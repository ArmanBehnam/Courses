2
00:00:10.898 --> 00:00:13.380
We're going to start
talking about Linux now.

3
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.520
This module is all about Linux.

4
00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.150
We need to talk about Linux because Linux
is the operating system that is running on

5
00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:19.940
the Raspberry Pi.

6
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.480
So when you use the Raspberry Pi
you're going to be using Linux.

7
00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.100
Now most of what we're talking about is
pretty much uniform for any Linux, okay?

8
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.810
We're talking about generic commands
just to know your way around

9
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.650
the operating system so that you can
use it and feel comfortable using it.

10
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.680
A lot of what we're gonna talk about
is about the text-based interface.

11
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.756
We'll also talk about
the graphic user interface, but

12
00:00:39.756 --> 00:00:42.970
the text-based interface is good
because I can list everything that

13
00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.270
the operating system can do more
easily in the text-based interface.

14
00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.930
And a lot of this can be done also
in the graphic user interface.

15
00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:50.840
I'll show you some of that too.

16
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.100
So let's start with the shell.

17
00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.320
Linux has a shell.

18
00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.480
A shell is basically a program
that intercepts user input and

19
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:00.270
executes commands.

20
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.210
So it's just the interface.

21
00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.860
The program that reads
what you type in and

22
00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.470
then outputs the results to the screen.

23
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.590
So that's the shell.

24
00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.570
It's the text-based interface for
the operating system.

25
00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.400
Now, there are many shells you can run.

26
00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.392
Lots of different shells, sh was the
original shell, right, for a Unix machine.

27
00:01:21.392 --> 00:01:26.085
C shell, TC shell,
there's a whole bunch of shells, right?

28
00:01:26.085 --> 00:01:28.900
The shell we're using is bash,
bourne again shell.

29
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.275
B-A-S-H, bash.

30
00:01:31.275 --> 00:01:35.319
That's the default one on Raspian,
for instance.

31
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.790
And on most Linuxes now,
people use bourne again shell.

32
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.750
It's the default shell, so when we open
up a shell, when we start a terminal

33
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.860
window and there's a shell running in it,
it's bash shell.

34
00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:45.860
You might wanna know that.

35
00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.260
If you wanna do more sophisticated
things later with shell scripting and

36
00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.089
stuff like that, you'll wanna
know which shell you're running.

37
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.010
Now shells, as opposed to graphic
user interfaces, using the shell is,

38
00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.080
it gives you more precise
control as the user.

39
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.570
Also it's precise and complete,
you can do everything out of the shell.

40
00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.740
Also for remote use, if you wanna connect
to a device and use it over a network,

41
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.060
something like that,
a shell is much more convenient.

42
00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.560
Because sending the graphics
information required for a GUI is slow,

43
00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:24.010
but also unnecessary and
it requires extra work on your part.

44
00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.580
So sometimes,
it's just easier to use a shell.

45
00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.290
Now, the downside of the shell is that you
really need to memorize a few of these

46
00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.440
basics in order to use it efficiently.

47
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.520
You don't wanna have to be looking up
in the manual everything you wanna do.

48
00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.730
So you wanna have in your mind a set
of basic commands that you just know

49
00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:44.660
in order to use the shell.

50
00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.560
I mean,
I still look up things in the shell,

51
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.980
but you wanna have the basic
commands in your head.

52
00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.613
So a console or terminal.

53
00:02:54.613 --> 00:02:59.746
This is, basically it's a term,
it's a text entry and display device.

54
00:02:59.746 --> 00:03:02.350
So it used to be physical device.

55
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.180
So you used to have a vt100 or vt220
terminal, I had one of these in my house.

56
00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.220
It's like a screen,

57
00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:13.450
keyboard, and I'd connect it by
a modem to the main computer.

58
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.310
And it was my terminal or my console.

59
00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:22.520
Now basically, people don't usually
use vt100 terminals at home anymore,

60
00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:23.780
usually you use virtual terminals.

61
00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.920
So virtual terminal means,
that's what we'd be using,

62
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.010
it's a window that appears on your
screen which runs a shell in it.

63
00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.420
So a terminal,
its whole job is to run the shell.

64
00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.660
And to run whatever the shell
program is to read your input.

65
00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.870
And then send those shell commands to the
operating system and get them executed.

66
00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.330
And then, take the responses and
print them to the screen.

67
00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.320
So, a terminal is basically what's running
the shell, or a console runs a shell.

68
00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.738
Virtual consoles are what we use,
basically a window,

69
00:03:51.738 --> 00:03:53.421
that a shell is running in.

70
00:03:53.421 --> 00:03:57.370
LXTerminal is the terminal
used in Raspian.

71
00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:58.190
The default terminal.

72
00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.540
So, there's an application called
LXTerminal and you run that application.

73
00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.610
It will open a window
with the terminal in it.

74
00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.010
So, from the GUI, tpically we're gonna
start in the Raspian with its GUI running,

75
00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.880
and when we want a shell we can start
LXTerminal and pop open a terminal.

76
00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.570
And by the way, to start there,
if you setup Raspian up in the top bar,

77
00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.760
there's a little picture
at top toward the left,

78
00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.870
there's a little picture of a terminal,
of a screen.

79
00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.450
You click on that and
that starts the terminal.

80
00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:25.950
It starts LXterminal.

81
00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:29.460
So that's how would you typically
invoke a terminal from Raspian's GUI.

82
00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.520
This is what LXTerminal looks like.

83
00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.340
So, once you start it, then you
get a Window that looks like this.

84
00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.580
And you can see in there, there's just a
little bit of text and a prompt, $ prompt.

85
00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.610
After the prompt,
you type in your commands, hit Enter.

86
00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:44.725
And it executes them.

87
00:04:44.725 --> 00:04:45.909
Thank you.

88
00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:50.632
