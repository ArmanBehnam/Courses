00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:01.990
Creating files.

2
00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:05.370
So how do you make a new
file inside a file system?

3
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.148
So there are a number of ways to make
a new file depending on how you want to

4
00:00:09.148 --> 00:00:09.671
do this.

5
00:00:09.671 --> 00:00:14.553
So for instance if you want to do it
programmatically, if you want your code

6
00:00:14.553 --> 00:00:19.220
to do it you'll call Open, or
F-Open to open a file, Open if it's C.

7
00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.606
But anyway in Python well
actually we'll do this.

8
00:00:22.606 --> 00:00:26.610
There's a way to do in Python, you can
call a function in Python, Open and Close,

9
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:27.730
and things like this.

10
00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.110
That's not what I'm talking
about right now, though.

11
00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.420
Let's say you want to just manually
create a file with some text in it, okay?

12
00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.819
For whatever reason you want to
put some text in a file.

13
00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:40.664
Or likewise,
you maybe want to view an existing file.

14
00:00:40.664 --> 00:00:43.680
You want to see what text is
inside in an existing file.

15
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.315
So if you want to do this manually,
not through a program,

16
00:00:47.315 --> 00:00:50.968
a typical way to do this is to
use some type of text editor.

17
00:00:50.968 --> 00:00:53.898
It's like a word processor,
but simpler, okay?

18
00:00:53.898 --> 00:00:55.895
Now you could use
a full-on word processor.

19
00:00:55.895 --> 00:00:59.421
For instance, if you had Microsoft Word
you could run Microsoft Word,

20
00:00:59.421 --> 00:01:02.095
create types and texts, hit save, right?

21
00:01:02.095 --> 00:01:03.346
And that makes a file.

22
00:01:03.346 --> 00:01:05.297
So that's one way to make it.

23
00:01:05.297 --> 00:01:08.830
Right now we're going to talk about
text editors which are much more plain.

24
00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:14.040
So when you use a program like Microsoft
Word or some fancy schmancy text,

25
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.930
word processing type of program, it
doesn't just put the bare data in there.

26
00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:25.010
So say I type the word hello, and
that's in my Word file, and I save it.

27
00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.320
If I were to look at the actual
data inside that file, it would

28
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.640
have the characters hello, but it would
also have a lot of other junk in there.

29
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.170
When I say junk, stuff, useful stuff,
formatting, like what's the font,

30
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.560
right, with the font size.

31
00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.370
All this other information can
be in there, inside the file.

32
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.740
And if you think about a word processor,
you can put pictures in there,

33
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:47.980
all kinds of stuff.

34
00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.500
And all that has to be stored
inside the docx file or

35
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.550
whatever it is, the output file of
the word processor that you're using.

36
00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.904
Now what we're going to use right
now is just a plain old text editor.

37
00:01:58.904 --> 00:02:02.368
So what it's going to put in
the file is just what you type

38
00:02:02.368 --> 00:02:04.515
plus a few invisible characters.

39
00:02:04.515 --> 00:02:09.539
For instance, carriage return, okay,
when you hit Enter on the keyboard.

40
00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.550
That carriage return,
it is not visible exactly.

41
00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.362
I mean it moves to the next line but
it's not a visible character, but

42
00:02:16.362 --> 00:02:20.945
in the file that character has to actually
be saved as an actual character, okay?

43
00:02:20.945 --> 00:02:24.560
So but these text editors are generally,
they're minimal, okay?

44
00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.538
They put in exactly what you type plus
a little bit more bare essential,

45
00:02:28.538 --> 00:02:31.206
usually carriage return information or
tabs.

46
00:02:31.206 --> 00:02:34.890
Things like tabs, right, a tab is
something that is invisible, right?

47
00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.450
You can't see the tab, but
you got to put it in the file.

48
00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.070
So a text editor just puts the bare
minimum information in there and

49
00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:43.410
it's much simpler.

50
00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.270
And it doesn't look like anything,

51
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.531
meaning you can't get something looking
nice just based off a text editor, right?

52
00:02:49.531 --> 00:02:51.560
But that's not the point.

53
00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.780
If you're using a text editor,
that shouldn't be the point.

54
00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.140
If you need something that looks nice,

55
00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.640
you should be using a word
processor of some kind.

56
00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.719
Right now I'm just talking
about plain old text editors.

57
00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:05.601
Now there are several text editors
available for Linux for free.

58
00:03:05.601 --> 00:03:07.429
There are a lot of them, okay?

59
00:03:07.429 --> 00:03:12.004
VI, VIM, EMAX, EMAX is my favorite
just because that's what I

60
00:03:12.004 --> 00:03:16.181
learned to use when I first
started learning Unix really.

61
00:03:16.181 --> 00:03:19.022
When I was first working on Unix,

62
00:03:19.022 --> 00:03:22.987
I started with the EMAX and
that's what I use.

63
00:03:22.987 --> 00:03:28.346
There are so many, okay, and
there are lots of philosophical or

64
00:03:28.346 --> 00:03:32.926
religious arguments about
which is best and all that.

65
00:03:32.926 --> 00:03:36.566
They're all the same, just choose
a favorite one and you stick with it.

66
00:03:36.566 --> 00:03:39.480
So right now I just mentioned Nano,
Nano's a common one.

67
00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:42.510
Nano, it looks something like this.

68
00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.290
It's pretty plain.

69
00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.660
You're going to have to install this,
though,

70
00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.590
it doesn't come by default with
the Raspbian image anymore.

71
00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.380
So you install it by typing
sudo apt-get install nano,

72
00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.945
type that and it'll install Nano for you.

73
00:03:57.945 --> 00:04:02.283
Now then to start Nano,
you just go into a terminal window and

74
00:04:02.283 --> 00:04:04.679
type nano, and it will start it.

75
00:04:04.679 --> 00:04:07.258
And you will get something that looks
like what you see on the screen.

76
00:04:07.258 --> 00:04:09.073
And you can just type your text, save it.

77
00:04:09.073 --> 00:04:11.038
There are a bunch of control sequences.

78
00:04:11.038 --> 00:04:13.174
Basic functions are via control sequences.

79
00:04:13.174 --> 00:04:18.405
So you can quit, and save, and all that
stuff through various control sequences.

80
00:04:18.405 --> 00:04:22.430
But just learn how to use one of these
like Nano, something like that, and

81
00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.660
just stick with that forever and
you never really have to change.
