2
00:00:10.803 --> 00:00:13.983
So the Raspberry Pi uses
an operating system.

3
00:00:13.983 --> 00:00:16.983
It pretty much requires
an operating system be executing,

4
00:00:16.983 --> 00:00:18.490
which is unlike the Arduino.

5
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.390
So what we're gonna do in this module is
really focus on the operating system.

6
00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:24.630
It's a Linux operating system.

7
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.400
It's called Raspbian,
it's a Linux distribution.

8
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.290
And in order to use
the Raspberry Pi properly,

9
00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:32.810
you have to be able to use Linux, you
have to be fairly comfortable with Linux.

10
00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.930
So that you can get around the operating
system, see files, use them,

11
00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.730
change them, execute code,
that sort of thing.

12
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.150
So we'll go through Linux, and a lot of
what we're talking about in this module

13
00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.520
will be sort of generic to
Linuxes all over, any Linux.

14
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.257
But we'll talk specifically about Raspbian
and the features of Raspbian operating

15
00:00:50.257 --> 00:00:53.582
system, the Linux operating system
that's running on the Raspberry Pi.

16
00:00:53.582 --> 00:00:54.662
Thank you.
