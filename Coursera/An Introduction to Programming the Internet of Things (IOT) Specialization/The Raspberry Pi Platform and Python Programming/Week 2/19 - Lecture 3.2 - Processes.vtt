2
00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:12.411
So, we actually mentioned
processes before.

3
00:00:12.411 --> 00:00:15.984
This is one of the advantages of having an
operating system, is that you can execute

4
00:00:15.984 --> 00:00:19.030
multiple processes,
multiple programs at the same time.

5
00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:21.720
A process is the execution of a program.

6
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.800
So if I start a program,
I've started a process.

7
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.660
A process is basically a run
time instance of a program.

8
00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.800
So Linux allows multiple
processes to run concurrently.

9
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.460
Now, remember I said not really
concurrently but it's swapping them in and

10
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.140
out so fast that to a user it
looks like it's concurrent.

11
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.680
You can have a foreground process,

12
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.902
one that's running in the foreground
that the human is interacting with.

13
00:00:46.902 --> 00:00:51.255
And then the rest of the processes
are background processes that run in

14
00:00:51.255 --> 00:00:52.373
the background.

15
00:00:52.373 --> 00:00:56.189
They're useful, having multiple processes
running in the background is immensely

16
00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:59.528
useful so the machine can be taking care
of all these things that you take for

17
00:00:59.528 --> 00:01:01.180
granted while you're not doing it.

18
00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.170
So while you're doing your word
processing or whatever it is, the machine

19
00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.810
can be grabbing your email from
an email server, downloading a file for

20
00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.500
you in the background,
waiting for network connections.

21
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.330
Maybe you got like a server
running on your machine that's

22
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.700
waiting for connection.

23
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:17.940
Checking for viruses, right?

24
00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.130
Your virus checking machine, it can
be searching your drive checking for

25
00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.450
viruses while you're doing
whatever you're doing.

26
00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.050
So there are lots of different reasons
why you have these background processes.

27
00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.460
Actually the operating system Linux and
Unix,

28
00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.790
Unix really, they call these background
processes demons a lot of the time.

29
00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.250
Cuz they're sort of lurking in
the background doing things for you right?

30
00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.870
So you've got these demons that are just
running essential tasks in the background

31
00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:41.620
while you work.

32
00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.448
So in Linux if you want to view
a process you use a command called ps.

33
00:01:48.448 --> 00:01:51.360
Ps we're seeing the output
of ps right here.

34
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.510
Now ps, actually this is ps I've
given it an a option a is for all.

35
00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.178
So ps by default, if you just type ps
it'll give you the processes started from

36
00:02:00.178 --> 00:02:02.230
that shell, from the current shell.

37
00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:03.610
From the current user, right?

38
00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:09.230
Which is a short list, actually in this
case I just see the shell itself and

39
00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:11.000
maybe the ps function itself.

40
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.220
But if I wanna see every process running
on the machine I can type psa and

41
00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.880
this is just a subset of them,
it's a very long list, but

42
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.310
you can see each row is
a different process.

43
00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.930
The left most column is
a process ID number, so

44
00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.680
every process gets a unique ID number.

45
00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.320
And you can see that unique
ID number on the left.

46
00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.640
Kill can be used to kill a process,
so you can type kill and

47
00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.110
give its process ID number and
kill the process.

48
00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.393
And this is useful a lot,
because, basically,

49
00:02:38.393 --> 00:02:41.928
you can kill a job that's
having a problem, right?

50
00:02:41.928 --> 00:02:44.981
So, say your browser's locked up.

51
00:02:44.981 --> 00:02:49.587
You can open the terminal window,
type psa, see all your processes,

52
00:02:49.587 --> 00:02:53.920
and then kill the process
that's devoted to the browser.

53
00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.420
And it will kill that browser and

54
00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.340
everything else will still keep running,
so kill's useful.

55
00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.000
Shutdowns another command
that you should use.

56
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.358
So shutdown basically,
whenever you have a Linux box,

57
00:03:04.358 --> 00:03:06.328
you shouldn't just unplug
it all of a sudden.

58
00:03:06.328 --> 00:03:07.770
You should shut it down properly.

59
00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.090
Proper shutdown procedure is needed to

60
00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.730
set data structures maintain certain
data structures in the operating system.

61
00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.380
Flush buffers,
close files things like this.

62
00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.064
So you don't shut down a Linux machine,
sorry,

63
00:03:20.064 --> 00:03:22.431
you don't just unplug it you shut it down.

64
00:03:22.431 --> 00:03:27.170
So all you do is type shutdown at
the command prompt and that shuts it down.

65
00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.441
Then it will do all its' shutdown
stuff and it'll power it down.

66
00:03:31.441 --> 00:03:32.020
Thank you.

67
00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:41.029
