2
00:00:10.463 --> 00:00:15.713
So using the graphic user interface
with Raspian, it's nice to use that.

3
00:00:15.713 --> 00:00:17.766
You don't always want to be
working from the terminal and

4
00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:19.520
most of the commands we've
been talking about so

5
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.720
far, we've been talking about
using them at the terminal.

6
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.587
But with Linux, it is really useful
to be able to use the terminal.

7
00:00:25.587 --> 00:00:27.070
That's why we're talking through it.

8
00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.503
But most of the time,
you might wanna use the GUI.

9
00:00:31.503 --> 00:00:32.921
Oh and certainly,
you can have both options.

10
00:00:32.921 --> 00:00:35.589
So you can run the GUI and
start a terminal from within the GUI,

11
00:00:35.589 --> 00:00:37.180
that's basically what I do.

12
00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.540
I have the GUI running and

13
00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.280
then I have the terminal, I can create
terminals inside that, so I can use both.

14
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.790
So if you boot up your machine and
you don't have the GUI,

15
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:54.040
you boot it straight into the terminal,
then you can type startx to start the GUI.

16
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.010
Startx starts what's called
the x windowing system,

17
00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:02.610
that's a Window system that's usually used
with Linux and certainly with Raspian.

18
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.410
Now the Windows system has
what's called a window manager.

19
00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.158
We're not gonna go into depth,

20
00:01:08.158 --> 00:01:12.254
but the window manager determines
the look of the graphic user interface.

21
00:01:12.254 --> 00:01:13.754
Now we're not gonna get
sophisticated about this.

22
00:01:13.754 --> 00:01:17.160
But if you wanted to, you can get
that thing looking however you want.

23
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.524
You can make it look, they have window
managers that look just like windows or

24
00:01:20.524 --> 00:01:21.422
look just like Mac.

25
00:01:21.422 --> 00:01:23.609
You can make it look
exactly the way you want.

26
00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:26.810
This is unlike operating systems
like Windows and Mac OS and

27
00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.046
stuff like this where they are associated
with their graphic user interface.

28
00:01:31.046 --> 00:01:33.671
Like when you see Windows,
it looks a certain way.

29
00:01:33.671 --> 00:01:35.504
When you see Mac, it looks a certain way.

30
00:01:35.504 --> 00:01:39.108
Linux, you can have it look however you
want based on the window manager that

31
00:01:39.108 --> 00:01:39.740
you choose.

32
00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.379
Now we're not gonna go changing the window
manager, we'll use the default one.

33
00:01:43.379 --> 00:01:45.889
But understand that Linux
has this flexibility,

34
00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:48.587
the operating system is
separate from the graphics.

35
00:01:48.587 --> 00:01:51.469
So you can grab whatever window manager
you want or you could make your own,

36
00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:52.171
if you wanted to.

37
00:01:52.171 --> 00:01:57.235
So you only use startx to
start the windowing system

38
00:01:57.235 --> 00:02:05.379
if you haven't configured Raspian to go
to the desktop, which I recommend that.

39
00:02:05.379 --> 00:02:11.005
But if you didn't, you can do startx and
start the graphic user interface too.

40
00:02:11.005 --> 00:02:12.990
The manager determines the look.

41
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.572
Now here's a snapshot of what my
desktop looked like at the time when I

42
00:02:17.572 --> 00:02:18.680
recorded this.

43
00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.970
So I just took a snapshot.

44
00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.390
You can see that generally,
it's just like a regular windows system.

45
00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.046
I've got three windows up right now.

46
00:02:27.046 --> 00:02:29.145
You can see desktop in the top bar,

47
00:02:29.145 --> 00:02:32.629
I have some icons up there
that programs are attached to.

48
00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:37.795
There's a menu upper left button where
you can get a menu of things to do.

49
00:02:37.795 --> 00:02:40.655
On my desktop in the background,
you can see a bunch of files,

50
00:02:40.655 --> 00:02:43.629
which actually the screenshots
that I made these slides out of.

51
00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:47.710
[LAUGH] And then I got three windows open,
two of which are terminal windows.

52
00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:50.010
I got the top terminal window,
bottom terminal window.

53
00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.414
And then to the right,
I've got a file manager window,

54
00:02:52.414 --> 00:02:54.510
which I'll talk about in a second.

55
00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.212
But this is typical, it's just
a regular windows system and you can,

56
00:02:58.212 --> 00:03:02.129
do I'm assuming you're familiar with
these type of windowing systems.

57
00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:05.151
If you ever use a Windows or a Mac
machine, you know what they look like and

58
00:03:05.151 --> 00:03:06.650
they're all pretty darn similar.

59
00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.796
File manager is useful.

60
00:03:09.796 --> 00:03:14.671
The icon to start the file manager
on the desktop is a top bar.

61
00:03:14.671 --> 00:03:18.740
It's a little icon that looks like a file,
a file drawer, a couple of file drawers.

62
00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.617
You click on that,
it'll start the file manager and

63
00:03:20.617 --> 00:03:22.032
this is just a regular file interface.

64
00:03:22.032 --> 00:03:24.417
[COUGH] You got folders and
files in there,

65
00:03:24.417 --> 00:03:28.796
you can double-click on a file to open
it or execute it if it's executable.

66
00:03:28.796 --> 00:03:33.671
Double-click on a folder to
go into the directory, so on.

67
00:03:33.671 --> 00:03:35.800
So, stuff that you're used to.

68
00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.254
Similar to Windows and Mac, same thing.

69
00:03:39.254 --> 00:03:40.836
Thank you.

70
00:03:40.836 --> 00:03:49.439
