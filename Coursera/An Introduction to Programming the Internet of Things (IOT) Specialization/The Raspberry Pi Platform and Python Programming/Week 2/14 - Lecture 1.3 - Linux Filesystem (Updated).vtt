00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:05.580
So I'm going to talk about a filesystem,
what a filesystem is.

2
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:06.810
Every operating system or

3
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.340
basically every operating system
provides you with a filesystem.

4
00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.530
It is one of those pieces of an operating
system that you always find.

5
00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:13.571
And we will talk about Linux's.

6
00:00:13.571 --> 00:00:16.220
And they are all vert similar.

7
00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:18.750
So even though we're talking
specifically about Linux,

8
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.135
because that's what by
default runs on Raspberry Pi.

9
00:00:21.135 --> 00:00:26.277
This is common to Windows or iOS or
whatever filesystem you're using.

10
00:00:26.277 --> 00:00:33.850
So a filesystem is basically a hierarchy
of directories and eventually files.

11
00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.820
So a directory is basically actually,
another term for

12
00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.350
that that you may have
heard of is a folder.

13
00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.000
People call them folders for, graphically,
when you have a graphic user interface,

14
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.054
a lot of time,
they're drawing these folders.

15
00:00:45.054 --> 00:00:49.870
But a directory's just a holder,
a container for a bunch of files,

16
00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:51.800
a place where files live.

17
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.630
Call that a directory.

18
00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:58.560
And a filesystem is
a hierarchy of directories.

19
00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:03.230
And then eventually in these directories,
you have files also in this directory.

20
00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.960
So directory can contain other directories
but it can also contain files.

21
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.760
So what I'm showing here is sort of
a hierarchy, I'm drawing it as a tree,

22
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.130
this is a common way to draw it,
for a Linux Filesystem.

23
00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.790
And at the top, that top node right there,
that is slash, forward slash, right?

24
00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.500
And that is root, the top directory.

25
00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.340
And so, that's just the name of it,
it's called slash.

26
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:26.474
And then within that directory,

27
00:01:26.474 --> 00:01:28.348
I'm showing four different
directories that it has.

28
00:01:28.348 --> 00:01:33.062
You can see the nodes underneath it,
bin, etc, home and user.

29
00:01:33.062 --> 00:01:35.540
These are common inside Linux.

30
00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.320
And then inside home, you can see
there is another directical pi.

31
00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.300
And inside pi,

32
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.917
there are three more directories,
desktop, indiecity, and python-games.

33
00:01:44.917 --> 00:01:46.912
So this tree that you see,

34
00:01:46.912 --> 00:01:52.643
this is a hierarchy of directories
inside some typical Linux Filesystem.

35
00:01:52.643 --> 00:01:56.631
Now note that I don't have any
files in this picture, but I could.

36
00:01:56.631 --> 00:02:02.159
So the leaf nodes, the bottom nodes of
this type of graph would be files, right?

37
00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.830
Because inside a directory, directory
can have other directories in it.

38
00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.070
Which can have other and
so on recursively, but

39
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.270
eventually you've got some files in there,
right?

40
00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.560
So any of these directories can have
a set of files that are at the bottom

41
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.150
of this tree.

42
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.680
So that's what the filesystem is and
when you want to refer to files,

43
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.830
you refer to them, well,
there are two ways to refer them.

44
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.450
But we'll talk about that actually
in the next set of slides.

45
00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:27.460
But right now,

46
00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.640
let's look at some Linux commands that
let you look at the filesystem, okay?

47
00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.670
And there are a set of these,
this is just one.

48
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.610
PWD, so PWD, what it does is
when you type it in the prompt,

49
00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.100
it tells you what directory
you are currently in.

50
00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.390
So this is an important thing
about a shell running in Linux.

51
00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.450
Every shell has its own current directory.

52
00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.940
A directory that it is
currently running in.

53
00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.280
So what that means is if you
type a file name at the prompt,

54
00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.340
it will look for it in the current
local directory, all right?

55
00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.770
And the current directory can change, and
we'll talk about that in the next set of

56
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.070
slides, but
you can change the current directory.

57
00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.590
But there's always a current directory
associated with any particular shell.

58
00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.870
And PWD, the whole point of command is to
tell you what the current directory is.

59
00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:19.090
So if I typ, pwd, at prompt here, I get
/home/pi, then notice the naming, right?

60
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.232
Slash, the first slash is the root.

61
00:03:20.232 --> 00:03:22.278
Underneath that is the home directory.

62
00:03:22.278 --> 00:03:25.306
Underneath that is the pi directory,
and that's the directory that I'm in.

63
00:03:25.306 --> 00:03:26.827
So /home/pi.

64
00:03:26.827 --> 00:03:31.034
Notice it between each one of these
directories, directory names,

65
00:03:31.034 --> 00:03:34.220
they put a slash,
a forward slash in between.

66
00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.332
So that's how they represent
the higher interims,

67
00:03:36.332 --> 00:03:39.070
sort describe the hierarchy when
you're going through that tree.

68
00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:44.389
But that's what PWD does, and
we'll talk about more in the next set.

69
00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:47.110
So yeah, it basically reports to
the directory that you are currently

70
00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.765
in, thank you.

71
00:03:47.765 --> 00:03:53.167
