00:00:11.863 --> 00:00:13.266
And, rolling.

3
00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:17.979
>> So module two talks about accessing the
Internet in a Raspberry Pi through a piece

4
00:00:17.979 --> 00:00:20.960
of code, programmatic control.

5
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.260
And specifically we're talking
about the sockets interface.

6
00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.468
So thee socket interface is traditionally
how programmers connect to the Internet.

7
00:00:29.468 --> 00:00:34.864
So how you write code to connect to
an IP address and a different port,

8
00:00:34.864 --> 00:00:40.000
send data to a server,
receive data back, and so on.

9
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.843
You do that using the sockets interface.

10
00:00:41.843 --> 00:00:45.692
And sockets interface comes with a set of
functions that are defined in the sockets

11
00:00:45.692 --> 00:00:49.598
interface that we can call from Python
that establish connections, resend data,

12
00:00:49.598 --> 00:00:51.375
receive data, and so on.

13
00:00:51.375 --> 00:00:54.655
So we will talk about these functions and
show a little code how you can make

14
00:00:54.655 --> 00:01:00.280
a client and a server, a generic
client and server, on a Raspberry Pi

15
00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.860
that will allow it to interact with
some other device on the network.

16
00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.876
And so this is where we really get
into Internet of things capabilities,

17
00:01:07.876 --> 00:01:11.500
because since we're running a Linux,
we have a lot of possibilities.

18
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.010
The fact that we can use
a socket-based interface is easier,

19
00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.050
much easier because we're using
a Linux operating system.

20
00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.964
And we show a little demo where we go and
actually connect, allow you to

21
00:01:22.964 --> 00:01:28.062
remote control a device, an LED through
a Raspberry Pi on the Internet.

22
00:01:28.062 --> 00:01:31.405
And so you can control it remotely
from another machine, thank you.
