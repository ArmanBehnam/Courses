2
00:00:10.258 --> 00:00:14.458
In this demo we're going to use the camera
module and the raspberry pi, so

3
00:00:14.458 --> 00:00:18.970
let's first disconnect to
the raspberry pi using Secure Shell.

4
00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.190
So I'm starting my putty
Secure Shell Client and

5
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:28.010
again I'm typing in, if you've seen
any of these other recent demos,

6
00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.839
I'm typing in the IP
address of my Raspberry Pi.

7
00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:37.050
[INAUDIBLE]
there it is.

8
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.160
Open, okay, I get a prompt for my login.

9
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.840
Type in Yes.

10
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:44.620
Okay.

11
00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.670
And let me change the screen size here.

12
00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.980
Let's go to change settings,
just to change the appearance,

13
00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.300
get a nice font and apply that.

14
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.600
Okay.

15
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.002
Shrink this up a little bit.

16
00:01:01.002 --> 00:01:05.420
All right, so now we've got our
Raspberry Pi connection right here.

17
00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.420
So, I've got my terminal window, and you
can see, it's connected to Raspberry Pi.

18
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.660
So, now, before I can use the camera,
first thing I need to do

19
00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.550
is actually,
plug the camera into the Raspberry Pi.

20
00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:26.440
So, to plug the camera into the Raspberry
Pi, I'm not showing you that, but

21
00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.220
it's not that hard.

22
00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.070
What you do is you look on
top of the Raspberry Pi.

23
00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.550
There's a special camera connector.

24
00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:32.360
It says camera.

25
00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.380
It's admittedly a small font but
if you look on top of it,

26
00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.420
there's a port,
a special port that says camera.

27
00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.400
So if you have the camera module,
you'll see that at the end of the strip

28
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.760
there's a bunch of little connectors and
it only fits into one slot on the board.

29
00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.260
So it says camera on top of it.

30
00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:51.710
So you slide it in there.

31
00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.470
Now actually to slide it in,
you're going to have to.

32
00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.180
Pull up a little tab, slide it in and
then push down the tab.

33
00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.840
So, but it's not that hard once
you locate the camera connector,

34
00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.930
which says camera on it, but it's small.

35
00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:05.680
It's not that hard.

36
00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.590
You slip the tab in there and
you can also Google this, but

37
00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.190
you slip it in there and it's connected
and then once you've connected it,

38
00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.130
you have to enable the camera
port on the Raspberry Pi, so

39
00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.600
the way you do that is
you use raspi-config.

40
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.860
So I'll start typing
this sudo raspi-config.

41
00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.590
So this configures several
things about the Raspberry Pi.

42
00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.680
Now see I get this menu here, and
one of them says enable camera.

43
00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.760
Now I've already done this but
let's try it again.

44
00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:37.950
I select enable camera.

45
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.000
Do you want enable support for
Raspberry Pi camera.

46
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.820
Enable.

47
00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:42.650
Right?

48
00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.250
And great and now I can select finish.

49
00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.215
So let's go to finish right there, done.

50
00:02:47.215 --> 00:02:48.915
Would you like to reboot now?

51
00:02:49.995 --> 00:02:52.375
Normally you would reboot now.

52
00:02:52.375 --> 00:02:56.005
I don't want to reboot now, because
that will mess up my connection, and

53
00:02:56.005 --> 00:02:59.045
I don't need to because I've already
actually enabled the camera, so

54
00:02:59.045 --> 00:03:00.425
that shouldn't be a problem.

55
00:03:00.425 --> 00:03:03.075
So the camera should be enabled for
me, but you would normally reboot.

56
00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:10.560
Now okay so now that we've done that,
the camera's enabled,

57
00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.970
now we can start Python and
start using the camera.

58
00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.540
So what we'll do in this

59
00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.730
little demo is just actually
take a picture with the camera.

60
00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:21.750
So let's start Python.

61
00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:24.470
So now we've got a Python terminal prompt.

62
00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.390
Now in order to start it we've
got to import pi camera.

63
00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.400
Camera there we go, so we import it.

64
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.930
So now we've got the library the package
that we need for the camera.

65
00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.890
So now first thing we're
going to need to do is create

66
00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.040
an object of the pi camera class, so
we're going to call this constructor.

67
00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:53.210
So let's just call it
camera = picamera.PiCamera.

68
00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:55.890
Note the capitalization
you actually need that.

69
00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:56.700
So now we've got camera.

70
00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.270
Now that we have camera we can
start calling methods on camera and

71
00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:01.300
there are a lot of methods.

72
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:02.350
We can change settings and

73
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:07.300
all sorts of things but what we're
going to do is just capture an image.

74
00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.054
We'll start with that.

75
00:04:09.054 --> 00:04:18.170
So we'll say camera.capture and
then we can just give it a file name.

76
00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:22.550
Now I've already taken an image just
testing this, but let's make it a new one

77
00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:27.700
call it Test image, okay,
that's a fine name, .jpg.

78
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:34.350
Okay now as soon as I hit enter
it's going to take a picture.

79
00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:37.470
So I will place my face in front of
the camera so it can take a picture of me.

80
00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.590
Okay so its done.

81
00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.080
So there should be
an image called testing.

82
00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.508
So lets do an LS oh sorry.

83
00:04:45.508 --> 00:04:49.431
Let's quit python and now do LS and
look at the directory and

84
00:04:49.431 --> 00:04:54.857
see there's an image, there's a file
called test image.jpg over on the right.

85
00:04:54.857 --> 00:04:56.740
So that should be the image.

86
00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.920
So now we want to see the image.

87
00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:03.700
Now I'm going to see this
image on my Windows machine.

88
00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:09.380
So what I'm going to do, basically I have
a problem screen capturing the res re pi.

89
00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:11.765
That's why I'm doing this
all on my Windows machine.

90
00:05:11.765 --> 00:05:16.335
So, what I'm going to do to see the image
is I'm going to transfer that image file

91
00:05:16.335 --> 00:05:19.735
over from the raspberry pi
to my Windows machine and

92
00:05:19.735 --> 00:05:22.355
then on the Windows machine I'll
view it like a normal image.

93
00:05:22.355 --> 00:05:24.290
So, how will I do this?

94
00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:25.740
I will start up.

95
00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.460
I will use a protocol called Secure FTP or
SFTP.

96
00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.020
FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol.

97
00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:36.420
So SFTP, any SFTP client,

98
00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:42.420
I can download a free SFTP
client on my Windows machine and

99
00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:48.000
use it to connect to the SFTP server
that's running on the Raspberry Pi.

100
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.390
So how do you do this?

101
00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:53.560
So I've already installed one,
it's called WinSCP.

102
00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:57.230
So I'm going to actually have it
right here, I'm going to start that.

103
00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:58.130
Now you would have to.

104
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:02.195
Okay new version release,
I will not update the new version.

105
00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:03.270
[LAUGH] It opens like this.

106
00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:04.310
It's call WinSCP.

107
00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:10.480
Now winSCP, this is just one of many
FTP clients that you can install.

108
00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.680
This is a good one.

109
00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:15.430
Just Google winSCP and install it.

110
00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:20.400
That shouldn't be that difficult but
notice up here under the session it says

111
00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:26.910
file protocol and it has selected SFTP,
that's just the default protocol.

112
00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:27.600
That's what I'm going to use.

113
00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:32.520
It has other protocols it can use, but I'm
using SFTP, secure file transfer protocol.

114
00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:35.170
Whenever you transfer files you
should use a secure protocol just for

115
00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:36.640
securities sake.

116
00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:38.752
So I'm going to type in host name,

117
00:06:38.752 --> 00:06:42.369
host name is going to be the IP
address of my Raspberry pi.

118
00:06:47.744 --> 00:06:51.065
There we go and fusing port number 22,

119
00:06:51.065 --> 00:06:56.850
note that because that's where secure
shell and secure FTP are used.

120
00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:00.300
Oh, and note that there's an entry here
for username and another one for password.

121
00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:01.420
So I'll type in the username.

122
00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:03.290
I'll allow it to prompt me for
the password.

123
00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:06.790
I don't want to give it the password
in general at this stage.

124
00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:09.570
So I'll click log in, and
it should prompt me for the password.

125
00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:12.870
Searching for host connecting.

126
00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:17.960
Okay it prompts me for
the password I type it in.

127
00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:21.340
Click okay, bam.

128
00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:24.070
Okay now,
just to describe what you see here.

129
00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:26.770
Basically, if you look at this,
this is WinSCP.

130
00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:30.070
It really has two directories in it.

131
00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:34.920
On the right hand side is the Raspberry
PI's directory, the remote directory and

132
00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:38.320
if you look in here, these are all
the files on my Raspberry PI.

133
00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:43.420
On the base of the top, the home
slash pie directory in Raspberry pie.

134
00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:48.000
Then the left, over here, is my windows
directory actually, this is showing Harris

135
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.680
documents, this is my documents directory
and there's some stuff in there.

136
00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:55.630
So, my goal is to take something form
the Raspberry pi on the right and

137
00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:57.990
download it to the Windows on the left.

138
00:07:57.990 --> 00:07:59.490
So let's find the file on the right.

139
00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:03.195
The file on the right I call the test
image, that jpg, there it is, right?

140
00:08:03.195 --> 00:08:05.160
Testimage.jpg.

141
00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:10.040
So I select that file and
then I go up to the Download button and

142
00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:13.080
I click Download and that will transfer
it over to my Windows machine.

143
00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:13.650
So I click it.

144
00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:16.370
It did it and then if I look on the left,

145
00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:20.150
there is now a file
testimage.jpg on the left.

146
00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:21.030
So now I have it.

147
00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:24.152
So now I want to actually view
this image I can just go to

148
00:08:24.152 --> 00:08:29.730
the Windows Explorer to that directory.

149
00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:33.670
So if we look here, this is the directory,
Harris Documents, and

150
00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:35.550
I can see test image right there.

151
00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:41.290
If I double click on it, it should pull up
some kind of a viewer to view the image.

152
00:08:41.290 --> 00:08:46.790
So I will now double click on it to verify
and there we go, it's a picture of me.

153
00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:51.794
So that's what was taken with the Pi cam,
or Raspberry pi's camera module when I

154
00:08:51.794 --> 00:08:56.884
used the capture function and that's it,
pretty straightforward, thank you.

155
00:08:56.884 --> 00:09:05.249
