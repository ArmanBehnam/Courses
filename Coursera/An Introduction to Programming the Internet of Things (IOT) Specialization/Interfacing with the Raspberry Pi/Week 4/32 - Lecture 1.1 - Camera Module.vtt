2
00:00:11.688 --> 00:00:14.943
So, we're going to talk a little bit
about some more interesting sensors and

3
00:00:14.943 --> 00:00:17.070
actuators that you can
connect to Raspberry Pi.

4
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.300
And we'll start off with the camera
module, Raspberry Pi's camera module.

5
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.780
Raspberry Pi is a Linux machine, right.

6
00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:27.510
It's a Linux machine and
it's not a full Linux machine.

7
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.170
But it's a pretty good Linux machine.

8
00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.340
And it has a USB interface that's just
like a desktop, laptop and so on.

9
00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.670
So cameras, you can plug cameras into
the Raspberry Pi just like you could your

10
00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.350
laptop, desktop, through the USB
port if you wanted to, right.

11
00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.040
Cameras are very useful sensors for
IOT devices for many different

12
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.780
applications right, home security or
something like that, all kinds of things.

13
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.730
You want to have a camera, register
something, detect something, see movement,

14
00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.520
whatever you want to do, right.

15
00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.040
So cameras are useful in IOT devices and

16
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.950
you can connect a camera in
the traditional way, through the USB port.

17
00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.620
You can just take any USB camera and plug
it into a Raspberry Pi if you want to.

18
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.090
So there are many that you could use
through USB, but there's another, this

19
00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.530
Raspberry Pi camera module, and you see
a picture of it down there on the right.

20
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.190
That's the camera module you
can get from Raspberry Pi.

21
00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.940
Now this thing has a special interface
to Raspberry Pi, not through USB, but

22
00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.790
a more direct interface through
the camera serial interface.

23
00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.470
So If you look on the left,
bottom left, you see a zoom in picture

24
00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.430
of the Raspberry Pi's board and
see it says camera there.

25
00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.050
That's a little plug that is the camera
serial interface to the processor.

26
00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.290
And if you take one of these
Raspberry Pi camera modules and

27
00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.240
plug it into that camera serial interface,
you get a more direct

28
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.020
connection from the camera to
the processor than you would through USB.

29
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.570
More direct meaning faster
also easier to control.

30
00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.640
So there are a lot of libraries.

31
00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.740
There are libraries that help you control
this camera and do things with the camera.

32
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.100
So this is a convenient way to
connect a camera to a Raspberry Pi.

33
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.890
So you buy one of the Raspberry Pi Camera
Modules, you plug it into this camera

34
00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.120
plug, the CSI interface, and you can
use a lot of different camera features.

35
00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.250
And you can do video, stills,
stuff like this, time lapse.

36
00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.380
We'll go through a few of these,
but cameras are really important.

37
00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.590
And they're more complicated Sensors.

38
00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.260
They are not like a simple oh,
the light is on, light is off.

39
00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.000
They are a little bit more
complicated than that.

40
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.350
So it's interesting to use them.

41
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.310
And the fact that you got a full-on Linux
machine, Raspberry Pi running Raspbian or

42
00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.140
something like that, you got a Linux
machine behind it makes it easier to

43
00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.550
do interesting things with the camera.

44
00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.840
Yeah, so there are good libraries for
control built into the operating system.

45
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.440
So enabling the camera.

46
00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.240
So if you want to plug in
one of these cameras, and

47
00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.280
I don't expect that you
necessarily have it,

48
00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.450
we're not going to require this in
the homework or anything like that.

49
00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.060
But if you buy it, you can try it out.

50
00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.560
So first you gotta enable
the camera in software.

51
00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.040
So you use raspi-config to enable the CSI
interface, just to turn on that interface.

52
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.820
So, you connect to Raspberry Pi,
you type in raspi-config or

53
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:18.030
sudo raspi-config at the command line and
you'll start the configuration again,

54
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.510
which we've seen before actually when we
set up the machine in the first place.

55
00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.800
Then you just go and, so
use sudo raspi-config.

56
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.150
Then you enable, it'll pop open a screen,

57
00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:34.480
a GUI, sort of a GUI,
of course a bad GUI, but a simple GUI.

58
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.480
Put it like that, a simple GUI.

59
00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.590
And it'll be a menu system,
you can select some options.

60
00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.020
So select Enable Camera, and then select
Finish, and that will enable the camera.

61
00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.280
It'll enable the camera interface anyway.

62
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.120
And at that point, once you've done that,
you reboot the machine.

63
00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.392
And after that, you can actually access
the camera and use camera functions

64
00:03:52.392 --> 00:03:55.875
to do things like snap pictures and
video and stuff like that.

65
00:03:55.875 --> 00:03:57.314
Thank you.

66
00:03:57.314 --> 00:04:01.947
