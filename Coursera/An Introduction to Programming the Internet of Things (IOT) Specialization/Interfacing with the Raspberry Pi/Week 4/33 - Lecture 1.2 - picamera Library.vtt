2
00:00:11.502 --> 00:00:15.733
So picamera is the name of the library
that we were going to use to control this

3
00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:19.740
raspberry's picamera and
we'll talk about that in this lecture.

4
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:20.906
Start talking about it any rate.

5
00:00:20.906 --> 00:00:25.060
So the python-picamera library.

6
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.500
It has a bunch of functions and we'll go
through a set of these functions, not all,

7
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.870
but we'll go through sort of the
highlights and you can always google this

8
00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.560
and just see a list of basically
every single function that it has.

9
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.780
So first thing you're going to
want to do is install the library, so

10
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.002
you're going to do a sudo
apt-get update for safety.

11
00:00:43.002 --> 00:00:44.850
Just update is always a good thing to do.

12
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.940
But then sudo apt-get
install python3-picamera.

13
00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.950
I say python3, because I'm assuming
we're using Python 3.x, not 2.x.

14
00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.920
If you're using 2.x, you just say
python-picamera, but we're using 3.x, so

15
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.320
python3-picamera.

16
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.870
And that'll install it.

17
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.270
Now if you, to use the library,
you import the library.

18
00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:06.310
So import picamera.

19
00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.100
You start off with that always.

20
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.440
Then the first thing you're going to
want to do is instantiate an object

21
00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.680
of the PiCamera class.

22
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.450
So we'll say camera, we'll call it camera,
camera = picamera.PiCamera.

23
00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.750
So that creates an object of
the PiCamera capital P, capital C class.

24
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.150
So we've got this camera object now.

25
00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.580
Now once we've got the camera object we
can start calling methods on the camera

26
00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.430
that do various things to the camera.

27
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.100
So let's go through some
of these camera functions

28
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.140
that you invoke through camera methods.

29
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.510
So you can take a picture, right?

30
00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.810
Capture a picture,
camera.capture("pict.jpg").

31
00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.810
Now, note that it's saving a JPG, right?

32
00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.940
You give it a filename, it'll save it.

33
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.689
It can save in different formats.

34
00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:57.720
We won't really go into that, but
if you look at this, JPEG is an encoded,

35
00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.780
not encrypted, but
it's a compressed format.

36
00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.210
That takes a little bit of extra time
to do the compression operation.

37
00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.260
You can also save it raw and
we'll look at that,

38
00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.820
actually I don't know
if we'll look at that.

39
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.590
But you can save it raw
without the compression, but

40
00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.480
the picture's much bigger.

41
00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.800
And there are other formats you can
choose with other input options,

42
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.630
but just take this vanilla method
right here, camera.capture and

43
00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.510
you give the file name,
it'll save it with that name.

44
00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.300
So that's the most obvious thing
you want to do with the camera.

45
00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.810
Now, there are lots of different camera
settings, and you can change them.

46
00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.480
And we're not going to list them all.

47
00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.150
Again, Google is your friend with this and

48
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.940
you can get a list of
all the camera settings.

49
00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.930
But let's just go through a bunch of them.

50
00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.010
You change them all in the code.

51
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.646
So, camera.hflip, horizontal flip,
right, camera.vflip,

52
00:02:42.646 --> 00:02:45.695
vertical flip, true, false, whatever.

53
00:02:45.695 --> 00:02:48.949
Camera.brightness, that's 0 to 100,
so you can set the brightness.

54
00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.980
Camera sharpness set to 0, right?

55
00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.150
You can change these settings, these and
many more all the different tweaks on

56
00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.330
the camera's properties to change
the way the camera captures the image.

57
00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.980
But it's very simple just
invoke these methods on camera.

58
00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.990
Or rather these aren't methods,

59
00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:11.420
these are actually attributes
that are part of pi camera class.

60
00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:12.760
So you can change them directly.

61
00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.300
Viewing video on the Raspberry Pi screen.

62
00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.363
So this is something that
you often want to do.

63
00:03:19.363 --> 00:03:23.685
You say camera.start preview,
that starts a preview.

64
00:03:23.685 --> 00:03:28.645
You can view the video that the camera is
capturing, view it live on the screen,

65
00:03:28.645 --> 00:03:31.295
through the HDMI port,
on the screen of your Raspberry Pi.

66
00:03:31.295 --> 00:03:33.795
And then whenever you call this function,
this method,

67
00:03:33.795 --> 00:03:36.675
stop preview, that will stop the preview.

68
00:03:36.675 --> 00:03:40.140
Now note that this preview is putting
it on the Raspberry Pi screen but

69
00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.040
it is not saving the video anywhere.

70
00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.500
It's not capturing video.

71
00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.320
It's just taking whatever
video's running in real time and

72
00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.040
putting it on the screen for
you so you can see it.

73
00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.820
And you can start that and stop that.

74
00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.450
You can also capture video of course.

75
00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.190
So how do you capture video?

76
00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:57.700
It's pretty easy.

77
00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.360
In this case I'm just
saying import pi.camera,

78
00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.840
like usual, import time because
I want to have a sleep function.

79
00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.680
I can say camera.start_recording,
that's the name of the method.

80
00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.530
I give the name of a file and
it starts recording and

81
00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.060
saving the data in that file.

82
00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.640
Then I sleep for 10 seconds,
and then camera stop recording.

83
00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.330
So this will record for 10 seconds.

84
00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:20.838
So it's very simple to
actually do recordings, and

85
00:04:20.838 --> 00:04:24.714
there are lots of variations on this, the
file format you save it in and so on, but

86
00:04:24.714 --> 00:04:27.971
it's very straightforward to use
this thing and to record a video.

87
00:04:27.971 --> 00:04:32.579
Now one thing to note about these
videos is that this thing is saving,

88
00:04:32.579 --> 00:04:38.250
probably to the flash on the Raspberry Pi
and the space can be limited, right?

89
00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.450
Actually I think depending
on the directory you choose,

90
00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:43.550
it won't go to the flash, it'll go to
the SD, which is also a flash, but

91
00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.490
it will go to that micro SD.

92
00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.188
That thing has limited space, right?

93
00:04:47.188 --> 00:04:51.710
So video can hog up a lot of space,
so just be wary of that,

94
00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.930
that when you are recording these videos
you may use up its space pretty quickly.

95
00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.960
You can record too much.

96
00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.930
And you'll see that.

97
00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:00.380
So hopefully it doesn't.

98
00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:01.360
It might fail.

99
00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.420
So if you run out of memory space,
it'll fail,

100
00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:05.530
and it'll throw some kind of an error.

101
00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.240
But, just be aware of that.

102
00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.834
Thank you.

103
00:05:08.834 --> 00:05:14.323
