2
00:00:10.115 --> 00:00:14.350
Today we are going to rotate
a Servo from your Raspberry Pi.

3
00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:16.180
So, we have several components.

4
00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:17.510
We're going to wire them together.

5
00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.710
We're going to use the code
that we showed in lecture 3.1.

6
00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:22.230
Actually it's a little bit modified.

7
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.680
I will describe those
modifications in a little bit.

8
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.280
Right now let's go through
the wiring process.

9
00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.630
Now I just show you the parts.

10
00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.710
We have a raspberry Pi with some
wires coming out coming out of it,

11
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:32.440
which I will describe.

12
00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:37.000
Got a Servo motor, and
it's connectors are over here.

13
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.930
Got some assorted wires that we need for
wiring.

14
00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:40.710
Then we've got a battery pack.

15
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.300
External power.

16
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.980
With a black and a red for
ground and power.

17
00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.800
And then of course
the red board right here.

18
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.570
So what we're going to go,

19
00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.009
our goal in wiring this is we
have to wire to this Servo.

20
00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:56.490
Now this Servo, it has a yellow
on the left, red in the middle,

21
00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:57.890
brown on the right.

22
00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.810
Brown is ground,
red is power in the middle, and

23
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.830
yellow is signal,
which controls this rotation.

24
00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:09.160
Now, ground and power for this Servo
are going to come from this battery pack.

25
00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.050
The ground and the power.

26
00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.690
Because we want to use external
power because the battery pack,

27
00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:14.600
battery can supply,

28
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.220
the external battery can supply a lot
more current than the raspberry pi can.

29
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.030
My raspberry pi is in a case by the way,
in case you didn't notice.

30
00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.010
Now the Raspberry PI
will supply the signal.

31
00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.910
Now the signal though is
going to come out on pin.

32
00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:29.860
Here are the pins in here.

33
00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.550
The signal's going to come out on pin 12.

34
00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.290
That's where we're driving
the pulse with modulator signal.

35
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.470
Pin 12, so I've plugged in these
wires to attach those pins.

36
00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.890
Pin 12 is the one that's red.

37
00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.700
So that's going to be,
the red one right there.

38
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.020
The red is going to be the signal.

39
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.570
And then the black one here is
the ground of the Raspberry Pi.

40
00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:48.980
So we want to have a common ground.

41
00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.510
That is, the Raspberry Pi's ground is
going to be connected to the external

42
00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:53.320
battery pack's ground.

43
00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.010
Which is also going to be
connected to the Servo's ground.

44
00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:57.720
So everybody's going to
have the same ground.

45
00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.400
So we are going to wire that first.

46
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.740
So lets do that.

47
00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.370
Lets take the ground of
the battery pack and

48
00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.110
wire it into a column with the red board,
this one.

49
00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.430
Then lets take a black wire,

50
00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.650
connect it to the ground of the Raspberry
Pi, and wire that into the same column.

51
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.890
Same ground column so they are together.

52
00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.940
Now we need another black wire, we'll
connect this to the ground of the Servo.

53
00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.520
There we go.

54
00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.370
And we are going to wire
that into the same column.

55
00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.220
So now everybody's ground is connected.

56
00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.220
Raspberry Pi, external battery and Servo.

57
00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.970
So we've got the grounds connected.

58
00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.880
Then we want to connect the signal up.

59
00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.816
Now the signal is red on this
coming out of the Raspberry Pi,

60
00:02:46.816 --> 00:02:49.364
that's pin 12 of the Raspberry Pi.

61
00:02:49.364 --> 00:02:53.660
We'll take that signal and we're going
to wire it into the signal input

62
00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.430
of our Servo,
which is the orange one down here.

63
00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.510
Okay yeah, so we've got that wire.

64
00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.800
Now the last thing we need
to wire is the power.

65
00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.860
The power is this for the Servo.

66
00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.240
We're wiring that to the middle,
which is the power input of the Servo.

67
00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.190
A little bit awkward.

68
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.840
There we go.

69
00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.980
I don't know if you heard it, but

70
00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.195
the Servo actually rotated slightly
when I plugged the power in.

71
00:03:21.195 --> 00:03:23.530
Okay, so that's all wired together.

72
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.880
Now, to the program.

73
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.120
So the program, the slight changes.

74
00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.710
First I had to import time, the time
package had to be imported because

75
00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:36.490
there's actually, I call time sleep
just to slow things down a little bit.

76
00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.180
And also instead of four \g each,
I had a typo.

77
00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.930
Instead of four each, it's a four, it's a
four loop instead of a four \g each loop.

78
00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.610
Also another thing I had to change was
the range, that I span, the rotation,

79
00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.100
the duty cycle changed.

80
00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.206
So in original code,
duty cycle would go from 0 to 100%, and

81
00:03:54.206 --> 00:03:58.850
then 100% back to 0, but that's too
broad of a range for this Servo.

82
00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:00.820
I had to narrow it for the Servo.

83
00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:04.540
So now, the range will only go from
one to ten, and ten back to one,

84
00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.860
which is plenty of rotation actually for
this Servo.

85
00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.530
So we'll see how much
rotation momentarily.

86
00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.470
All right, so
now I'm going to run the code.

87
00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:19.090
So I've written the code and I've saved in
a script and now I"m going to evoke it.

88
00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.180
I'm going to do sudo,
s-u-d-o to become root.

89
00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.960
Python 3 and then PWM.py,
because that's what I called it.

90
00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:28.510
And I hit Enter and it should start.

91
00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.040
It now zeroed itself,
and now it's rotating.

92
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.430
Slowly going up from zero to a ten.

93
00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.000
And then it should go back momentarily.

94
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.020
There it goes back.

95
00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:42.481
One to ten, ten to one.

96
00:04:44.843 --> 00:04:47.826
And then, it hops back to zero,
and it's off.

97
00:04:47.826 --> 00:04:48.886
That's it.

98
00:04:48.886 --> 00:04:49.601
Thanks a lot.

99
00:04:49.601 --> 00:04:51.736
