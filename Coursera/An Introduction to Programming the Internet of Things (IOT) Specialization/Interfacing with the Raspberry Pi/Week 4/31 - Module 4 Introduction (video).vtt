So

3
00:00:12.156 --> 00:00:17.028
in previous courses, actually in this
specialization we've talked about

4
00:00:17.028 --> 00:00:21.790
using say the Arduino to connect
the sensors and actuators.

5
00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:25.550
And the Raspberry Pi can do all of that
too, can do almost the same things but

6
00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.150
because Raspberry Pi has
Linux running on it,

7
00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.390
it has a lot more
capabilities in those terms.

8
00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.310
So not that you can't do
these things in Arduino,

9
00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.610
but some things are a lot easier
given an operating system.

10
00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.530
The operating system can handle
some of the heavy work for you.

11
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.920
And make it easier for you as a programmer
to interact with some of these sensors and

12
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.100
actuators.

13
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.830
What we're going to do in this
module is talk more about

14
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:54.400
two examples of more
interesting sensors and

15
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.850
actuators that you can interact
with on the Raspberry Pi.

16
00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.040
We'll talk about the Raspberry Pi camera
module and how you interact with that.

17
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.350
And also how you interact with servos.

18
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.744
We'll talk about pulse with
modulation interface in general, and

19
00:01:06.744 --> 00:01:09.642
we'll give a servo example and say look,
here's how you can control these servos

20
00:01:09.642 --> 00:01:11.420
using pulse with modulation
on the Raspberry Pi.

21
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.546
Thank you.
