2
00:00:11.297 --> 00:00:15.115
So one thing we're going to need to do
is wire the servo to the Raspberry Pi so

3
00:00:15.115 --> 00:00:17.830
let's look at the wiring on a servo.

4
00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.660
All right.
What we see here, are two plugs for

5
00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.880
two different servos.

6
00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.310
They're basically the same thing,
it's three wires, okay?

7
00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.430
The only thing that changes
is the coloring of the wires.

8
00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.120
So, there's one coloring that's white,
and red, and black.

9
00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.990
And these other coloring over there,
actually, maybe there's three colors.

10
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.770
There's another coloring there
that's yellow and red and black.

11
00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.629
But I've also definitely, actually more
common than yellow, red and black,

12
00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:40.619
is yellow, red and brown.

13
00:00:40.619 --> 00:00:44.109
Okay, so basically you see
these different colorings, but

14
00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:46.308
it's basically three wires, okay?

15
00:00:46.308 --> 00:00:49.083
And you can, there are three holes, and

16
00:00:49.083 --> 00:00:53.912
you can plug a 24-gauge wire into
the holes to connect to the servo.

17
00:00:53.912 --> 00:01:01.550
[COUGH] so there's always power in both
of these color schemes, power is red.

18
00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.520
And actually, sometimes the power is
orange, if you have the orange and brown,

19
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:05.620
if you have like the yellow, orange,

20
00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.190
brown, then that orange one
is going to be the power.

21
00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.300
Then the ground is going to be black or
it can be brown,

22
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.150
depending on if you have
the differently colored servo.

23
00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.520
And then the signal, which has,
the signals the controlling information.

24
00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.449
That's going to be white on the white,
red, black or

25
00:01:24.449 --> 00:01:27.597
it's going to be yellow on the yellow,
orange, brown.

26
00:01:27.597 --> 00:01:31.240
Okay, so you've got these three wires.

27
00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.440
Basically power and
ground are the power for

28
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.760
the actual server,
that give it power to move, okay?

29
00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.060
But the signal is where you apply
the pulse width modulation.

30
00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.240
So the pulse width modulation that goes
on the signal wire, that's the control,

31
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.740
it tells the servo,
what angle it should turn too.

32
00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.720
So that really has the information
where the power and

33
00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.460
grounder just draw power to the device,
it's

34
00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.980
the signal wire that has the information
about what angle it should turn to.

35
00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.960
You know in terms of,
when I say it has the information,

36
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.360
it has pulse with modulated signal which
tells it what angle it should turn it to.

37
00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.165
So the pulse with modulated signal from
your Raspberry Pi is going to be connected

38
00:02:12.165 --> 00:02:14.590
to the signal wire, be it white or yellow.

39
00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.470
Now the power supply, you have to be
a little bit careful about the power to

40
00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.930
one of these servos or
to motors in general.

41
00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.690
The power that you give it has to be
a sufficiently big power supply, okay?

42
00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.780
Because motors can suck up a lot of power.

43
00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.100
Now this depends on the motor.

44
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.640
A small motor, a really small motor,

45
00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.970
maybe you can drive it directly
from your Raspberry Pi.

46
00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.530
But a big motor you can't,

47
00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.220
because the Raspberry Pi itself
can't supply enough current.

48
00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.992
So you have to assume with these motors
that generally the Raspberry Pi can't

49
00:02:49.992 --> 00:02:51.223
supply enough current.

50
00:02:51.223 --> 00:02:53.620
So, let's look at the motor,
the motor's power.

51
00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.625
So generally with these motors,
you use some external power supply.

52
00:02:57.625 --> 00:03:02.140
So the power input to servo wouldn't come
generally come from the Raspberry Pi,

53
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.020
it would come from some
other power supply.

54
00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.560
And by power supply, let's say, batteries.

55
00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.430
So you'd have some battery pack connected
and you want approximately five volts.

56
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.600
Now, if you have double
a batteries which are common,

57
00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.820
those things are 1.5 volts each, right?

58
00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.941
So if you want to get five volts you can
get 4.5 volts if you take three 1.5 volt

59
00:03:21.941 --> 00:03:25.480
batteries, put them in series,
and that's probably close enough.

60
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.388
That's what I would probably use
three batteries put in series and

61
00:03:29.388 --> 00:03:31.633
connect those up to the power supply.

62
00:03:31.633 --> 00:03:35.073
And remember that the power supply is
going to have a power and a ground output,

63
00:03:35.073 --> 00:03:37.437
so the ground goes to the ground
input of the servo and

64
00:03:37.437 --> 00:03:39.830
the power input of the servo
from your battery pack.

65
00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.460
So the reason why you have
this external power supply

66
00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.570
is because the Raspberry Pi
can't supply enough current.

67
00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:50.260
I don't remember the current limit on
the Raspberry Pi off the top of my head.

68
00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.520
I have it in some previous
lecture I think I mention it.

69
00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.470
But it's low and you want more.

70
00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.340
Maybe an amp, one amp here,
that's a lot but

71
00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.090
you definitely, Raspberry Pis
don't drive much current at all.

72
00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.030
So you're probably going to
need an external power supply.

73
00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.320
So, it has power and ground wires.

74
00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.570
You wire the external power
to the Servo's power wire.

75
00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:18.280
The external power supplies the power
to the power wire of the Servo.

76
00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.790
And you wire with ground,
the external power is ground,

77
00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.510
you wired that to the Servo too,
to it's ground.

78
00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.080
But you also wired the external
ground to the Raspberry Pi's ground.

79
00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.280
So you want what's called a common ground.

80
00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.540
You want everybody's
ground to be the same.

81
00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:36.100
So the ground that the Raspberry Pi sees,
the ground that the power supply sees, and

82
00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.660
the ground that the Servo sees
should all be the same ground.

83
00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.600
So that we have a common reference, okay?

84
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.380
So that means you're going to take
the ground of the external battery,

85
00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.490
external power supply, wire that to
the ground of the Raspberry Pi and

86
00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.070
wire that to the ground of the Servo.

87
00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:54.530
So everybody has the same ground.

88
00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.200
So, let's take a look
at the drawing of that.

89
00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.530
Here's my simple, simple drawing.

90
00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.150
On the left I've got my Raspberry Pi.

91
00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.390
On the right I've got my Servo.

92
00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:07.745
And on the bottom I've got that big plus,
minus battery thing,

93
00:05:07.745 --> 00:05:12.075
that's my battery pack with maybe three
double A batteries, something like that.

94
00:05:12.075 --> 00:05:14.225
Now the ground side, the negative side,

95
00:05:14.225 --> 00:05:17.455
the ground side of that external power
supply, it's wired to two things.

96
00:05:17.455 --> 00:05:20.625
The ground of the Raspberry Pi,
and the ground of the servo.

97
00:05:20.625 --> 00:05:23.595
The positive side of
that external battery,

98
00:05:23.595 --> 00:05:26.775
external power supply is connected
to the power of the servo.

99
00:05:26.775 --> 00:05:31.160
And then Raspberry Pi,
pin 12 I'm using in this case.

100
00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.360
It's connected through a resistor to
the signal input to the Servo, okay?

101
00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.430
And that's where the pulse-width modulated
signal is going to be, on pin 12.

102
00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:44.330
Now, couple of comments, one thing is
that, well, let's go through these.

103
00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:48.396
Only pins 12 and 24, based on the BOARD
numbering, not the Broadcom numbering,

104
00:05:48.396 --> 00:05:51.672
but the BOARD numbering can produce
pulse width modulated signals on

105
00:05:51.672 --> 00:05:52.940
the Raspberry Pi.

106
00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:53.620
Pins 12 and 24.

107
00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:58.438
In fact, only pin 12 on
the Raspberry Pi A and the Raspberry Pi B.

108
00:05:58.438 --> 00:06:02.850
The B plus allows you to use pins 24 for
pulse width modulation as well.

109
00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:04.850
So it's gotta be one of those two pins.

110
00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:06.950
I used 12 in this case,
but it could have been 24.

111
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:09.220
Another thing is,
that you can use a resistor.

112
00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:12.890
So you see there's a resistor between pin
12 and the signal input of the servo.

113
00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:18.490
You can use a resistor to
isolate the pins from the servo.

114
00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:21.670
What I mean by that is if there's
some kind of problem with the servo,

115
00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:28.920
some bad problem, the servo could
drive current through to pin 12.

116
00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.790
In the, so basically information's
going in the wrong direction.

117
00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:33.010
Power's going in the wrong direction.

118
00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:36.350
We don't want that but if there's some
weird malfunction with the server,

119
00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:40.550
say you dunked it under water or something
like that, such a thing could happen.

120
00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:42.410
So to isolate you put some resistant,

121
00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:45.800
maybe a one kilo ohm resistant
there just to reduce the current.

122
00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.189
So if it does have some kind of
jump in current it won't be so

123
00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:51.623
much that it'll hurt your Raspberry Pi.

124
00:06:51.623 --> 00:06:52.701
Thank you.

125
00:06:52.701 --> 00:06:59.714
