2
00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:12.602
We'll talk about Twitter.

3
00:00:12.602 --> 00:00:15.737
We'll start talking about Twitter
in this lecture and its API and

4
00:00:15.737 --> 00:00:19.140
how you can get the Raspberry Pi
to interact with Twitter.

5
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.110
So Twitter's API, they have an API,

6
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.670
Raspberry Pi can run several SDKs for
their API.

7
00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.780
So, you can download a bunch of different
libraries, we'll use on in particular.

8
00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.360
But you can download several
different libraries and

9
00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.470
use them to access twitter functions.

10
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.210
Raspberry Pi can make tweets.

11
00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.910
You can just connect and make a tweet.

12
00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.350
Also Raspberry Pi can respond to tweets.

13
00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.110
Oh by the way I should
mention that these tweets,

14
00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.150
when you make a tweet it's
called updating status.

15
00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.910
And that is actually going to be important
to us because that's the name of

16
00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:50.780
the function that we're
going to use to make a tweet.

17
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.140
But when I say make a tweet
I mean update status.

18
00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.640
And Raspberry Pi can respond to tweets.

19
00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.200
So, not only can it send tweets,
it can look through tweets and

20
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.730
do something if a tweet occurs,
or something like that.

21
00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.440
So, it may look for a tag,
maybe you want to search for

22
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.780
tags of a different type and look at
the text in those or something like that.

23
00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.320
But, it's a two-way thing.

24
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.010
So, Raspberry Pi can send tweets,
but also it can receive tweets and

25
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.690
scan through tweets.

26
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.490
So Twython is the package
that we will use so

27
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.270
that is the SDK that we are going
to use to access Twitter's API.

28
00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:26.490
There are other ones we could use but

29
00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.840
Twython is pretty good,
lots of good documentation on it.

30
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.248
So first thing you're going to
want to do is install it.

31
00:01:33.248 --> 00:01:36.950
Here are the three lines of code that
you're going to have to use to install it.

32
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.290
First you do an app get update
which is a good idea in general

33
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.390
just to do the update.

34
00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:47.793
But then you do an app get install
Python pip and then pip install Twython.

35
00:01:47.793 --> 00:01:51.362
So Python pip is an installer for
Python packages.

36
00:01:51.362 --> 00:01:57.200
So what you're doing first is installing
the installer, the Pip installer.

37
00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.580
And then, you're using
the installer to install Twython.

38
00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.890
But, this is easy,
just type in these three lines.

39
00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.092
It should just work cleanly.

40
00:02:04.092 --> 00:02:09.310
Okay, now, if you want to

41
00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.160
make an app that interacts with Twitter,
you have to register that app first.

42
00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.580
It won't allow you access unless
you've already registered and

43
00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.180
you have the keys to prove
that you registered.

44
00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.110
So you've gotta register
the app to access their API.

45
00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.930
Now to start with that, start that off,
you need a Twitter account.

46
00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.460
So I'm going to assume that
you get a Twitter account.

47
00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.810
They're free,
it's very quick to get a Twitter account.

48
00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.720
Just go to Twitter and get an account.

49
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.584
So, you start with that.

50
00:02:35.584 --> 00:02:38.936
Then you're going to need several keys for
authentication, actually in our case,

51
00:02:38.936 --> 00:02:41.721
they're going to be four different
keys that you're going to need for

52
00:02:41.721 --> 00:02:42.800
authentication.

53
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.475
So these four keys will be
hard coded interior code, and

54
00:02:46.475 --> 00:02:48.751
they'll be sent in the messages.

55
00:02:48.751 --> 00:02:52.575
When you establish a connection
with Twitter servers,

56
00:02:52.575 --> 00:02:56.570
you going to send these keys and
Twitter will use those keys.

57
00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.280
So the Twitter API,

58
00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.520
or SDK rather, Twython is going to use
those keys in establishing a connection.

59
00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.490
And sending them or
the equivalent of sending them.

60
00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:12.120
It won't send them directly, but
those keys are going to be used

61
00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.910
on the receiving end, on the server end
to authenticate who you are, right?

62
00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.220
To authenticate that you are this
person who registered previously.

63
00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:27.380
So you need these four keys in order to
to be able to interact and use the API.

64
00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.580
So to get these keys you
need to register you apps.

65
00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.030
So will go to the steps
of registering an app.

66
00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.570
This is the first you going to want to do.

67
00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.990
Before you have the app,
you just register it like this.

68
00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:42.498
So you start of,
go to http://apps.twitter.com.

69
00:03:42.498 --> 00:03:44.460
So start off by going there.

70
00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:46.960
And you get a page looks like this.

71
00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.700
And it's pretty simple, Twitter apps,
and it should be blank,

72
00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.270
this is how mine was when I
first did this, is just blank.

73
00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:55.641
And there's a button in there that
says create new app so go ahead and

74
00:03:55.641 --> 00:03:57.665
click on that and that's how you start.

75
00:03:57.665 --> 00:03:58.498
Thank you.

76
00:03:58.498 --> 00:04:00.614
