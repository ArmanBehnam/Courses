00:00:11.838 --> 00:00:15.795
>> In module three, we're going to
extend what we've been talking about.

3
00:00:15.795 --> 00:00:17.940
We've been talking about using
Raspberry Pi and networking it.

4
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.780
Communication on the network.

5
00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:20.570
We're going to extend that,

6
00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.690
and we're going to talk about how to use
the Raspberry Pi to communicate with

7
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:28.890
more sophisticated online web-based
services that exist on the network.

8
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.940
So, using the socket interface
we've already talked about,

9
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.400
you can send messages, receive messages,
but it's a very bare bones interface.

10
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.400
It's often the case that you want
your Raspberry Pi, or your device,

11
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.700
whatever kind of device it is,
to talk to a service and

12
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.240
request service from something outside.

13
00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.660
So somewhere else in the network because
the Rasberry Pi, it's limited right?

14
00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.940
It's small, it can only do so much,
it only has so much information.

15
00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.070
So, you may want to use
the Raspberry Pi as a front end, and

16
00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.280
then send out a request to a service,
to some other server somewhere,

17
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.570
to do something more, more elaborate.

18
00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.255
And then get the response
back to your Raspberry Pi.

19
00:01:06.255 --> 00:01:09.195
Now you could use a socket interface for
this, but

20
00:01:09.195 --> 00:01:12.355
it's much more difficult
to use that interface.

21
00:01:12.355 --> 00:01:15.507
It's better if you use
the appropriate libraries and

22
00:01:15.507 --> 00:01:19.296
they take care of all the details
of the network communication.

23
00:01:19.296 --> 00:01:23.983
So in this module, we'll talk about using
the Raspberry Pi to access these web based

24
00:01:23.983 --> 00:01:28.422
services, how to send out requests to
the service, how to get responses back.

25
00:01:28.422 --> 00:01:31.860
And sort of expand the possibilities of
what you can do with your Raspberry Pi,

26
00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.795
because you're not limited by what
the Raspberry Pi alone can do.

27
00:01:34.795 --> 00:01:38.628
You can use now these external public
servers that are available for you.

28
00:01:38.628 --> 00:01:39.879
Thank you.
