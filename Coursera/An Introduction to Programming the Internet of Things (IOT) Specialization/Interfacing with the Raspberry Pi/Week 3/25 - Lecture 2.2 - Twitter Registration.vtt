2
00:00:11.751 --> 00:00:13.178
We'll continue in this lecture on how
to register your application that's

3
00:00:13.178 --> 00:00:13.702
going to use a Twitter API.

4
00:00:13.702 --> 00:00:18.310
So we need to do that
before we can actually

5
00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:23.090
interact with the Twitter servers.

6
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.538
So, you've already clicked
on create new app.

7
00:00:25.538 --> 00:00:28.308
Now you get a window that
looks something like this.

8
00:00:28.308 --> 00:00:31.547
Create an application,
that's what it says at the top, and

9
00:00:31.547 --> 00:00:36.555
there's some text boxes for you to fill
in information about the application.

10
00:00:36.555 --> 00:00:40.480
So, you start filling in and,
of these text boxes,

11
00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.490
some of them have stars next to them,
like name and description and

12
00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.450
website, those have stars next to them,
you have to fill those out.

13
00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.650
So you can give it any name,
any description.

14
00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.930
I think the description has to be
at least ten characters long and

15
00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.620
it has a minimum limit.

16
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.910
And then it has a website.

17
00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.090
Now, for the website, any website is fine.

18
00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:59.590
It doesn't matter what website.

19
00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.098
I use UCI.edu, I think.

20
00:01:01.098 --> 00:01:04.080
It doesn't matter, really, what website.

21
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.300
And now, when you're making a real Twitter
app that you want to put out there and

22
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.150
have people access, then you might
want to have a relevant website,

23
00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:11.970
a website that really has,

24
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.580
maybe at that website you put information
about your app and how to use it.

25
00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.550
But right now, for our testing purposes,
any website is fine.

26
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.170
Then, at the bottom of this page,
you can't see it here, but

27
00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.710
if you scroll down at the bottom,
there's a button that

28
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.930
says Create Twitter Application, and
you click on that after you've filled in

29
00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.600
all the text boxes that you need to
fill in, you click on that button.

30
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.190
So, this button it starts off
with a window looks like this.

31
00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.660
My app was called iangharrisapp.

32
00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.610
And it gives you some application details,

33
00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.256
the initial information, it gives you
permissions and stuff like these,

34
00:01:45.256 --> 00:01:47.555
read-write, which by the way,
read-write should be default.

35
00:01:47.555 --> 00:01:48.555
It was for me.

36
00:01:48.555 --> 00:01:49.765
And that's what we'll want for this,

37
00:01:49.765 --> 00:01:53.345
because we're going to actually
want to write tweets and retweets so.

38
00:01:53.345 --> 00:01:54.895
But that shouldn't be a problem.

39
00:01:54.895 --> 00:01:56.245
It should be default setting.

40
00:01:56.245 --> 00:01:59.335
But you can look around and
see information.

41
00:01:59.335 --> 00:02:01.665
Now, the details, a bunch of details.

42
00:02:01.665 --> 00:02:05.190
Now, the consumer key,
you'll notice down there in red,

43
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.791
I have boxed off at the bottom,
I've blanked out this consumer key, right?

44
00:02:09.791 --> 00:02:11.440
because you don't need
to see my consumer key.

45
00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.990
Consumer key is one of those four
keys that you're going to need.

46
00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.960
That's one of them right there.

47
00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.652
So there's a set of other information,
if you scroll down,

48
00:02:18.652 --> 00:02:20.111
other information about your app.

49
00:02:20.111 --> 00:02:24.210
But that consumer key will eventually be
necessary, so you'll want to record that.

50
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.723
You can record it all at the end if you
want to, once you've gotten all the keys,

51
00:02:27.723 --> 00:02:29.401
you can just record them all then, but

52
00:02:29.401 --> 00:02:31.940
that's going to be one of the data
that you're going to need.

53
00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.610
So now to get the other keys, what you're
going to want to do is go to the Keys and

54
00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:37.730
Access Tokens tab.

55
00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.130
So if you see, right under the name
of the app, iangharrisapp,

56
00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.920
right under the name of that, there
are four words for tabs, essentially.

57
00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.490
So I circled one of them in red,
keys and access tokens.

58
00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.460
You click on that Keys and
Access Tokens tab,

59
00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:54.660
so you can go and actually access,
and get the rest of the tokens.

60
00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.419
So, when you go there,
it looks something like this.

61
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.090
And on this page it'll
show you two things.

62
00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.970
The consumer key, which we saw before,
and the consumer secret.

63
00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.950
So that's another key
that you need to record.

64
00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.230
So I've blanked both of those out for

65
00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.450
me, but
those are two of the four keys you want.

66
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.190
So that information's there.

67
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.570
It's not everything, though.

68
00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:17.590
There's other information.

69
00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.430
Still you're going to need
to create access tokens.

70
00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.320
So, at the bottom there's a button
that says create my access token.

71
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.170
So, you click on that button, and

72
00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.860
this is where it's going to give
you two more access tokens.

73
00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.050
So then,
you get a screen that looks like this.

74
00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:34.970
And you can see there
this access token and

75
00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.400
access token secret,
which I have again blanked out in red.

76
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.590
So those two are the other two keys
that you're going to need, right.

77
00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.220
So, now you've got four keys total
that you're going to need in your app.

78
00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.475
So make sure you record all those keys.

79
00:03:48.475 --> 00:03:51.630
And once you reconnect,
you log in again and reconnect,

80
00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.620
you can get those keys again.

81
00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.290
Just make sure you take down those keys.

82
00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:59.470
Thank you.

83
00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:04.010
