1
00:00:01.043 --> 00:00:03.482
IP stands for Internet protocol.

2
00:00:03.482 --> 00:00:08.566
An IP address is a unique address for
every machine on the Internet.

3
00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:10.079
So every machine has to have it.

4
00:00:10.079 --> 00:00:14.658
If you're going to speak on the Internet,
you gotta have your own IP address.

5
00:00:14.658 --> 00:00:18.267
TCP/IP uses IP address
as this unique address.

6
00:00:18.267 --> 00:00:21.808
TCP/IP that I'm naming like that,
those are two protocols.

7
00:00:21.808 --> 00:00:25.523
And these two protocols IP is essential.

8
00:00:25.523 --> 00:00:30.761
TCP or UDP are another pair or
protocols that we will talk about later.

9
00:00:30.761 --> 00:00:34.605
But these protocols are the protocols
that make up the Internet, right?

10
00:00:34.605 --> 00:00:39.498
So if you speak TCP and then you speak IP,
then you are using the Internet.

11
00:00:39.498 --> 00:00:42.862
And if you don't, then you're not
using Internet, that's the idea.

12
00:00:42.862 --> 00:00:48.035
So, in order to use the Internet,
you gotta have a unique IP address.

13
00:00:48.035 --> 00:00:52.829
Now, it's a unique number,
And IP version 4,

14
00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.172
the old version, the one that is probably
still most in use, but the old version.

15
00:00:58.172 --> 00:01:00.517
It uses 32-bit addresses.

16
00:01:00.517 --> 00:01:04.751
So 32-bit means, 4 bytes.

17
00:01:04.751 --> 00:01:08.912
And each byte, normally the way you
see it commonly are four numbers

18
00:01:08.912 --> 00:01:11.471
written in decimal separated by period.

19
00:01:11.471 --> 00:01:15.346
So in this case, 192.0.0.0.

20
00:01:15.346 --> 00:01:19.494
Four numbers, each one is between 0 and
255, because that's the byte,

21
00:01:19.494 --> 00:01:22.496
a byte it represents
a number between 0 and 255.

22
00:01:22.496 --> 00:01:25.897
So, [COUGH] that's what
an IP address looks like.

23
00:01:25.897 --> 00:01:31.238
Often the address is considered in
two parts, low bytes and high bytes.

24
00:01:31.238 --> 00:01:35.995
So, the network address,
the high byte that are common across

25
00:01:35.995 --> 00:01:40.506
an entire wide area network,
like for instance on campus.

26
00:01:40.506 --> 00:01:45.705
Maybe every address on campus has the same
two high bytes, something like that,

27
00:01:45.705 --> 00:01:50.672
where the host address, the low bytes are
the ones that are going to be unique for

28
00:01:50.672 --> 00:01:55.283
each individual host, each individual
machine on campus, lets say.

29
00:01:55.283 --> 00:01:56.848
So those are IP addresses.

30
00:01:56.848 --> 00:02:01.587
Now IPv6 is the new IP version,
when I say new, it's been around for

31
00:02:01.587 --> 00:02:04.218
a while but still not fully accepted.

32
00:02:04.218 --> 00:02:08.329
It uses 128 bit addresses.

33
00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:14.023
So as compared to 32 bit addresses
with IPv5, that's a typo, IPv5.

34
00:02:14.023 --> 00:02:18.123
Sorry, IPv4,
the current one is a 32 bit addresses.

35
00:02:18.123 --> 00:02:22.528
The new one is 128 bit,
so much bigger addresses.

36
00:02:22.528 --> 00:02:26.389
IPv4 only supports 2 to the 32 addresses,
maximum, right?

37
00:02:26.389 --> 00:02:27.779
because it's only got 32-bits.

38
00:02:27.779 --> 00:02:29.866
Internet already exceeds that number.

39
00:02:29.866 --> 00:02:35.007
There's more than 2 to 32 machines
on a network at any given time.

40
00:02:35.007 --> 00:02:38.103
So there are tricks that are pulled
in order to do that, right?

41
00:02:38.103 --> 00:02:42.047
because you can't have more
than 232 unique IP addresses,

42
00:02:42.047 --> 00:02:44.311
if you've only got 32-bits.

43
00:02:44.311 --> 00:02:49.587
So people use network address
translation to fake that out, okay?

44
00:02:49.587 --> 00:02:53.333
We're not going to talk about that
in this class, but it's a limit and

45
00:02:53.333 --> 00:02:55.509
it's a limit that's being exceeded.

46
00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:57.948
But eventually you've
gotta increase the size.

47
00:02:57.948 --> 00:03:00.986
If you want to increase the number
of machines on a network,

48
00:03:00.986 --> 00:03:05.392
you've got to go to a longer address, so
that you can have enough unique addresses.

49
00:03:05.392 --> 00:03:07.903
IPv6 also integrates security, so

50
00:03:07.903 --> 00:03:12.279
it uses IPSec to encrypt data in transit,
which is a good thing.

51
00:03:12.279 --> 00:03:16.916
Regular [COUGH] IPv4 does not
do any encryption all by itself,

52
00:03:16.916 --> 00:03:19.066
which makes it vulnerable.

53
00:03:19.066 --> 00:03:22.621
IPv6 incorporates several other
changes to the header, so

54
00:03:22.621 --> 00:03:25.629
some fields become optional and
things like this.

55
00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:28.930
But these are all details that
we don't have to worry about,

56
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.530
we're going to be using
IPv4 addresses anyway.

57
00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.014
IPv6 is not widely adopted yet,
it needs to be.

58
00:03:36.014 --> 00:03:39.297
Now, ports.

59
00:03:39.297 --> 00:03:45.935
A port number is a unique identifier for
an application on a machine.

60
00:03:45.935 --> 00:03:49.562
So IP addresses,
they uniquely identify the machine, but

61
00:03:49.562 --> 00:03:54.652
on a particular machine, there may be many
applications running on that machine.

62
00:03:54.652 --> 00:03:57.658
And each application maybe want
to talk on the network, right,

63
00:03:57.658 --> 00:03:59.282
to other machines on the network.

64
00:03:59.282 --> 00:04:03.409
So then each application on the machine
has a different port number, okay?

65
00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:09.073
So the IP protocol it uses IP
addresses to refer to a machine.

66
00:04:09.073 --> 00:04:12.951
But to refer to particular
applications on a particular machine,

67
00:04:12.951 --> 00:04:17.468
you would use either the TCP or the UDP
protocol, talk more about them later.

68
00:04:17.468 --> 00:04:22.799
But TCP, UDP and their addressing,
they use port numbers for the addressing.

69
00:04:22.799 --> 00:04:24.453
So, here's what I mean,

70
00:04:24.453 --> 00:04:28.304
these ports to address a specific
application on a machine.

71
00:04:28.304 --> 00:04:34.252
So, as an example, you can have
a machine that wants to talk on,

72
00:04:34.252 --> 00:04:37.902
maybe you want to use a browser, right?

73
00:04:37.902 --> 00:04:41.988
So web browsers use port 80, web servers
rather, they use port 80, right?

74
00:04:41.988 --> 00:04:46.224
So web browser sends a page request
on port 80 to the web server, and

75
00:04:46.224 --> 00:04:50.255
the server is always listening
to port 80 for request, right?

76
00:04:50.255 --> 00:04:53.619
So port 80 has to be open for
a web server to be used,

77
00:04:53.619 --> 00:04:58.056
because port 80 is known as the place
that web servers are listening to,

78
00:04:58.056 --> 00:05:00.753
as the port web servers are listening to.

79
00:05:00.753 --> 00:05:04.124
So, and that's just one application,
say I've got Secure Shell.

80
00:05:04.124 --> 00:05:08.500
Secure Shell server it's
known to be a port 22, okay?

81
00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.892
So every application type
has its own port number.

82
00:05:11.892 --> 00:05:12.999
And so these ports,

83
00:05:12.999 --> 00:05:17.641
this is what I was saying actually in a
previously lecture about firewalls, right?

84
00:05:17.641 --> 00:05:19.064
These ports have to be open.

85
00:05:19.064 --> 00:05:20.662
They can't be blocked by a firewall,
alright?

86
00:05:20.662 --> 00:05:24.107
A firewall could just block
off traffic in a port, and

87
00:05:24.107 --> 00:05:28.869
if you want to use a web server, then
you gotta have port 80 open and so on.

88
00:05:28.869 --> 00:05:32.400
You gotta be able to write on port 80.

89
00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:37.850
So, it's a 16 bit value in the TCP or
UDP header.

90
00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:44.829
16 bit value meaning you can have,
roughly 2 to 16 port numbers.

91
00:05:44.829 --> 00:05:49.387
The low port numbers are the ones
dedicated to particular applications,

92
00:05:49.387 --> 00:05:51.824
like when I say low 1023 and below.

93
00:05:51.824 --> 00:05:56.287
Above that they're just open ports,
you can use them for whatever you want.

94
00:05:56.287 --> 00:05:57.272
Thank you.
