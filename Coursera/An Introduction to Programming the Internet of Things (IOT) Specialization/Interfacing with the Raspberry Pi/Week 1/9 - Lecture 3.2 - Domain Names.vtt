2
00:00:11.385 --> 00:00:13.170
We'll talk about what a domain name is and

3
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.870
how a domain name is used
to get an IP address.

4
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:16.690
So a host names and

5
00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:21.400
domain names, each host on
the internet has a unique IP address.

6
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.940
For instance,
the one I'm showing right there.

7
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.160
So, that's unique, supposed to be.

8
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.550
Now, IP addresses are needed
to send messages, right, so

9
00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.320
if you want to send a message to a host,
you need his IP address, and

10
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.550
the IP address is included in the IP
header of the package that's being sent.

11
00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.280
The IP addresses, though,
are not easy for humans to memorize.

12
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.830
We don't memorize numbers that well.

13
00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.740
Some of these numbers, I do,
I do remember some IP addresses actually.

14
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.760
When I was a kid, I used to
remember IP addresses all the time.

15
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.410
Now, it's a pain to remember all the IP
addresses that you might want to access,

16
00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.850
so we use domain names instead.

17
00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:56.530
Pseudonyms.

18
00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.940
So ics.uci.edu, or cnn.com,
something like that.

19
00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.670
Humans can memorize that.

20
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.670
So in order to send a message each
domain name that the human knows must

21
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.250
be translated into, has to be resolved,
into an IP address to send the packets.

22
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.130
So the human types in the domain name,

23
00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.940
and then that has to automatically
get converted into an IP address

24
00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.360
that can be included in the packet
header and the message can be sent.

25
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:29.100
So, for that we use what's called
domain naming system, DNS.

26
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.200
So DNS is basically a big hierarchical
naming system to determine IP addresses.

27
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.230
So basically imagine a gigantic table,

28
00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:42.230
imagine a big table that maps
domain name to IP address.

29
00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:46.758
Now there isn't just one table because
this is worldwide network, right.

30
00:01:46.758 --> 00:01:54.710
So it's actually a hierarchy of tables in
different machines across the world okay.

31
00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.020
And it's a range,

32
00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.770
it's not that complicated we're not going
to go into the details of the protocol.

33
00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.760
But the idea is that when
you at you're machine,

34
00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.517
you want to go to a web page, say cnn.com.

35
00:02:07.517 --> 00:02:12.540
That cnn.com has to get converted
to the IP address of cnn.com so

36
00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.970
you perform what's called a DNS lookup.

37
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.540
So now, when I say you perform,
your web browser performs this.

38
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.730
Your web browser sends a message
to a DNS server and says,

39
00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.980
look, what is the address of cnn.com?

40
00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.390
And if this Domain Name Server,
this DNS server knows that address,

41
00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.650
it sends it back to you,
sends the IP address back to you.

42
00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.560
If it doesn't, then it goes and
asks another DNS server higher up.

43
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.610
It says look, do you know where to
find this, where this IP address is?

44
00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.870
And if it knows, it sends it back.

45
00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.150
If it doesn't,
it asks another DNS server and so on.

46
00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.570
Eventually you get to
the top level DNS server and

47
00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.210
that will be able to find any address.

48
00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:56.220
But that system,
we won't go into the details, but

49
00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.200
there is what's called the process
of a DNS lookup where your machine

50
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.520
sends out a request to say look, for
this domain name, what is the IP address?

51
00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.200
And eventually it gets
the IP address back.

52
00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.460
So that's the DNS lookup.

53
00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.120
And that has to happen every time,

54
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.280
at least the first time, every time you
go to a domain name that has to happen.

55
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.450
Now for performance reasons you don't
want to do this DNS Lookup every time you

56
00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.320
go to a website if you can help it.

57
00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:26.320
So if I go to cnn.com once,
rather than looking it up

58
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.730
every time I type in cnn.com It
stores it in a cache, a local memory.

59
00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.380
It stores that address in local memory,
and so

60
00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.040
that the next time I go to cnn.com
it doesn't have to look it up again.

61
00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.120
So that saves time, performance wise.

62
00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.279
But, this DNS Lookup has
to happen at least once.

63
00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:50.640
So this DNS lookup usually perform by your
tools, by your web browser let's say.

64
00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.090
Behind the scenes,
you don't have to do it manually, but

65
00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.280
you can do it manually on a Linux
box just to see how it works.

66
00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.060
So you can use, let's called nslookup,
so if you go to your raspberrypi or

67
00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.000
any Linux box and you type nslookup and
you give a domain name, like here.

68
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.390
nslookup www.google.com.

69
00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:10.780
So we see some data here.

70
00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.980
First, you see server and address.

71
00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.340
So what that's telling you
is where the DNS server is.

72
00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.260
So what that means is,
whatever domain you're in

73
00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.300
there's a DNS server associated
with your domain, right.

74
00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.560
Now, there's a default DNS server, or
you can specify it if you wanted to.

75
00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.510
But I didn't specify it,
this is my default for my domain.

76
00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.310
The server's address is 192.168.1.1, and

77
00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:41.650
see where it says address,
it's the same IP address.

78
00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:46.020
Then it's just pound sign 53, so
that pound sign 53 is the port number.

79
00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.750
53 is a port number associated with DNS.

80
00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.090
So if I want to do a DNS
look up from my machine,

81
00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:58.810
I have to go to 192.168.1.1 and
port number 53.

82
00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.130
I go to that machine at that port and

83
00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:07.160
there's a DNS server waiting there
to receive my lookup request.

84
00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.370
So that's where the server is, but then
where Google is, you see at the bottom.

85
00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.443
Name, google.com, address, blah.

86
00:05:12.443 --> 00:05:17.770
So that tells you at least
where their outside server is.

87
00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.790
So, it performs a lookup and it gives
me the answer and it prints it to me.

88
00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:24.820
So you can do that
manually if you want to.

89
00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:29.070
When I say back in the old days I used to
memorize IP addresses In the old days.

90
00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:34.190
Back when I was an undergrad, the network
wasn't as necessarily reliable as it is

91
00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:37.660
now, and the server itself might be down.

92
00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:39.190
So there would be times
I would try to connect.

93
00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:42.760
This is pre-web before Internet.

94
00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.290
Not before Internet,

95
00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:48.000
but before you had web browsers,
before you had the web at all.

96
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.788
But say I want to connect it to
an email or something like this.

97
00:05:52.788 --> 00:05:57.057
When you want to connect you give a domain
name and it has to first do a lookup to

98
00:05:57.057 --> 00:06:01.330
the domain name server, but if somehow
your connectivity to the domain name

99
00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:06.350
server was down then you couldn't connect
to wherever your actual destination was.

100
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:09.870
Just because the domain name server was
down you couldn't get the IP address.

101
00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:14.274
So sometimes it was useful to memorize the
IP addresses so that you could just type

102
00:06:14.274 --> 00:06:17.666
that in and not bother with
the name saver server connection.

103
00:06:17.666 --> 00:06:20.104
So if the domain server was down you
could still make your connection.

104
00:06:20.104 --> 00:06:24.527
So for that reason,
people memorized some addresses.

105
00:06:25.723 --> 00:06:26.268
Thank you.

106
00:06:26.268 --> 00:06:34.127
