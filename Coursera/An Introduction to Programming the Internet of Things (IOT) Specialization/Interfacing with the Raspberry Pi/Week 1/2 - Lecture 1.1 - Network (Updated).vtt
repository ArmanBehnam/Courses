1
00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:03.970
Connecting your Raspberry
pie to a network.

2
00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:07.910
This is pretty done easy because
it's using a real operating system.

3
00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:09.310
It's using Linux.

4
00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:12.100
Now one way is to use
a wired connection that is

5
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.540
using the built-in RJ45 connector, right?

6
00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:16.460
So you can use a wired
Ethernet connection,

7
00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.200
plug it into a jack in your wall.

8
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.460
I'm assuming you're not going to be doing
that because people don't do that so much.

9
00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.810
But you could do that, no problem.

10
00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.540
The more common way is to
use a WiFi connection.

11
00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.220
And that's using
the built-in WiFi adapter.

12
00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.630
So it's built into the board,
you don't have to do anything with this.

13
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.170
You do minimal.

14
00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:35.579
Just what you would do with
a Windows machine, or a Mac,

15
00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.830
or any Linux machine, it's very easy.

16
00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.235
So what do you do to connect to a network?

17
00:00:41.235 --> 00:00:43.892
So power up the Raspberry Pi,
you've already done the setup.

18
00:00:43.892 --> 00:00:45.311
Power up the Raspberry Pi.

19
00:00:45.311 --> 00:00:48.480
Start WiFi config from the desktop, okay?

20
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.674
You can find an icon
in the pull down menu,

21
00:00:50.674 --> 00:00:55.260
you could find it in the pull down menus
or you could do it from a console window.

22
00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.780
Select WiFi config.

23
00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.350
Then you get a pop-up like this.

24
00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.460
It allows you to select a network and
give a password.

25
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.406
Now you've seen very similar interfaces
on any, a Mac or a Windows, and

26
00:01:06.406 --> 00:01:10.233
any Linux machines you ever use,
it's the same thing.

27
00:01:10.233 --> 00:01:11.958
You get this pop-up, you click scan,

28
00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:15.080
it'll show you a list of all
the networks that you can receive.

29
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.450
You click one, you type in a password
if it's secured and that'll be that.

30
00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.230
It's very simple to connect to WiFi
network, to any network, to a wired or

31
00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:24.020
WiFi network.

32
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.810
You just do it like this.

33
00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.775
Now once you connect in that way,
just like you would with your laptop.

34
00:01:31.775 --> 00:01:36.165
And DHCP is going to be
used to get an IP address.

35
00:01:36.165 --> 00:01:40.110
DHCP is just a protocol
to give an IP Address.

36
00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.720
So everything on that network has
to have some unique IP Address.

37
00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.090
And before you've connected
your device to the network,

38
00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.410
it doesn't have an IP Address.

39
00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.560
You power it on, it gets one,
dynamically, that's what DHCP is for.

40
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.550
But that's all built-in,
there's nothing for you to do for that.

41
00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.900
You don't have to worry about
the protocol or anything like that.

42
00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.790
Now then you're probably going to
want to use a web browser.

43
00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:01.500
Now you don't have to.

44
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.120
There are lots of ways to use a network
without using a web browser but

45
00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.920
say you do,
there's a pre-installed one, Chromium.

46
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.970
Just click on its icon and
they will appear and

47
00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.370
you'll be using a web browser just like
any other machine, it's pretty simple.

48
00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.645
Now one thing to warn
you about is firewall.

49
00:02:18.645 --> 00:02:24.800
[COUGH] We're not talking heavily
about firewalls in this class.

50
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.570
But you should be aware of them because
sometimes they make it hard for you.

51
00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.950
So it depends on a network you're using.

52
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.686
But what happens is,
sometimes say I'm using a school network.

53
00:02:36.686 --> 00:02:37.580
Say here, right?

54
00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.010
Here at UCI.

55
00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.240
My network,
whenever I set up a new computer,

56
00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.410
by defaults lots of ports are blocked off,
are firewalled.

57
00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.239
So what happens is there are these ports,
16,000 ports roughly,

58
00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.862
and almost all of them are blocked off.

59
00:02:53.862 --> 00:02:56.000
So there's a firewall that
the department sets up,

60
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.572
because I don't run the network, right?

61
00:02:57.572 --> 00:02:58.719
The department does.

62
00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:00.649
The department has firewalls so

63
00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:05.520
no traffic can be sent on pretty much
any port except for 80 or something.

64
00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.220
Port 80 is what web traffic is on.

65
00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.770
So if you have a web browser or
web server [COUGH] it would be on port 80.

66
00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.440
But all the rest of the ports
they basically block off.

67
00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.710
And this is a problem for
me because I need the other ports.

68
00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:20.410
So what happens is every port is
associated with an application.

69
00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.670
So for instance, say I want to use
Secure Shell, which I always use.

70
00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.310
That's on port 22.

71
00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.760
That I always have to say,
please unblock port 22 for me, right?

72
00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.240
Because I need it, right?

73
00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:38.040
So what may happen is you may have
a firewall on you system that you didn't

74
00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.920
set up or maybe you turned it on and
you didn't know what it was doing, right?

75
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.710
And it may be blocking
your communications.

76
00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:46.490
So maybe you have this firewall.

77
00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:51.554
Now it must be set to allow
an application's traffic.

78
00:03:51.554 --> 00:03:54.980
So each application is going to
have its own different port.

79
00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.220
Now most of the time, port 80,

80
00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:02.350
which is for web browsing,
that's almost always unblocked, right?

81
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.530
Because everybody wants
to use a web browser.

82
00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.246
But there are other applications
like Secure Shelf for

83
00:04:07.246 --> 00:04:10.400
me or, maybe a game, right, for you.

84
00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.560
They all use different ports and
those may be blocked.

85
00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.490
So when you run other applications,
it may not work, and

86
00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:19.430
it may be because of a firewall.

87
00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.710
If that's the case, either you had to
fix the firewall or you have to get

88
00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.280
an administrator to fix the firewall to
open up that traffic, open that portfolio.

89
00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.856
So if you run a network application and
it doesn't work,

90
00:04:29.856 --> 00:04:31.689
you want to check the firewall settings.

91
00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:34.290
Just say look, is this port open, right?

92
00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:35.570
Or ask the network administrator.

93
00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:39.420
So this is just something, it's out of
the scope of the class a little bit but

94
00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:40.350
it may cause you a problem.

95
00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.720
You should be aware that
this happens sometimes.

96
00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:48.044
And by the way, as a note, one way
that I get around this type of thing,

97
00:04:48.044 --> 00:04:52.917
that I try to get around this type
of thing if I'm sort of in a pinch

98
00:04:52.917 --> 00:04:57.729
is I use my cellphone and
make a WiFi hotspot from that, right?

99
00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:00.729
And that doesn't have any firewall on
it because I didn't put any on it, and

100
00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:02.129
then I can get around any of that.

101
00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:05.431
Which is somewhat unsafe because
now you're not using a firewall but

102
00:05:05.431 --> 00:05:08.991
it gets over these problems sometimes,
at least for the short term.

103
00:05:08.991 --> 00:05:11.287
Thank you.

104
00:05:11.287 --> 00:05:14.981
