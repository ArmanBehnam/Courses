2
00:00:11.941 --> 00:00:15.330
Module one is where we start to
talk about the Raspberry Pi and

3
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.135
connecting it to the Internet.

4
00:00:18.355 --> 00:00:22.519
Now, we're talking about, in this module,
we just talked about connecting it to

5
00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:25.645
the Internet in a sort of a user way,
not a programmatic way.

6
00:00:25.645 --> 00:00:30.212
So, by this I mean, connecting to
the Internet and using it as if you were

7
00:00:30.212 --> 00:00:34.972
sitting it down at a laptop or desktop,
and use the computer in that way.

8
00:00:34.972 --> 00:00:36.742
So you got to, that's a different,

9
00:00:36.742 --> 00:00:39.100
a very different interface
then if you're a programmer.

10
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.850
Right, we'll get to programming later, or
we'll start at the end, but right now,

11
00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.360
we're just going to say, hey, look,
how do I connect this to the Internet?

12
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.570
How do I make sure that
it gets an IP address?

13
00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.860
And address, how does it join the network?

14
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.630
And then once it join the network then
I can run web browser, email server,

15
00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.710
whatever I want to run,
I can run network applications, but

16
00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.830
we're just going to talk about how
to connect it on to the network.

17
00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.070
We'll talk about wired and
wireless network.

18
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.520
Then we'll start talking about the
Internet in general, how the addressing

19
00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.580
works, because eventually we have to move
to programming the network connection.

20
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.198
Rather using it as a user, we want to
write code that connects the network and

21
00:01:16.198 --> 00:01:17.350
access the network.

22
00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.260
So we start getting into that
by the end of this module and

23
00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.330
describing the protocols for that and

24
00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.540
how programmatically you
would start controlling it.

25
00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.763
So we have to talk a little bit about
IP addressing and port addressing so

26
00:01:28.763 --> 00:01:32.006
that we know about that, so that we
can write code that deals with that.

27
00:01:32.006 --> 00:01:32.686
Thank you.
