2
00:00:11.837 --> 00:00:14.705
We're going to talk now
a little bit about the network,

3
00:00:14.705 --> 00:00:18.260
about the Internet and
how to interact with it through a code.

4
00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.700
So eventually that's we want to do.

5
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:21.730
In our Internet of things,

6
00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.630
our IRT devices, we want to be able to
write codes that talk on the network.

7
00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.311
So we'll talk a little bit about that,
and start introducing the Internet and

8
00:00:29.311 --> 00:00:30.837
its protocols and how it works.

9
00:00:32.546 --> 00:00:37.065
So a programmatic networking, so by this
I mean using the network through code,

10
00:00:37.065 --> 00:00:39.080
through a program.

11
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.300
Now accessing a network
on a Raspberry Pi or

12
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.020
really any device as a user
is pretty straight forward.

13
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.870
We've seen this.

14
00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.390
You just go to your machine, you connect
to the network, open a browser for

15
00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.400
instance, open a email application.

16
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.200
You open some appropriate network
application and you work with it and

17
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.480
you run it and great,
a user can interact on the network.

18
00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.060
But we want, when we're making
these IOT devices, we want.

19
00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.560
Not so much manual direct,
manual interaction.

20
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.120
We want some program that's
running on our IoT device

21
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.870
to be able to actually
interact on the network.

22
00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.510
So we want that program, it should
be able to talk to other servers,

23
00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:15.800
other machines on the network, and

24
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.293
get data from those machines,
request services from those machines.

25
00:01:19.293 --> 00:01:25.520
So the isn't the only device
that's doing the work.

26
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.850
So it can offload work to a foreign
machine, or remote machine, and

27
00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:29.520
get results back.

28
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.800
And so from the user's point of view, the
whole system is much more complicated and

29
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.070
interesting.

30
00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.840
So you can have interaction between
the network and some network servers and

31
00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.230
the world, with the Raspberry Pi
basically in between.

32
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.880
Or the Raspberry Pi, or

33
00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.930
whatever your IOT device is, it's in
between, getting data from the world.

34
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.250
Interpreting that, sending it to
the network, getting some service,

35
00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.560
getting results back to the Raspberry Pi,
whatever your device is, and

36
00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.950
then sending actuations out to the world.

37
00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.880
Put us up on the screen,
making something happen.

38
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.550
So that's what we want, that's what
Internet things is really supposed to do.

39
00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.920
It's supposed to take this
natural environment and

40
00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.480
interface it with the network some how.

41
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:13.410
So for instance, you have a little
cloud over there that's the Internet.

42
00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.500
Has the Internet, and some servers on
the Internet that you might be interacting

43
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.930
with, maybe providing some
kind of service that you want.

44
00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.370
And then there's a Raspberry Pi,
which is remote somewhere local,

45
00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.110
remote from the servers.

46
00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.400
And it has sensors and actuators, because
I was implementing this embedded device.

47
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.700
It's IOT device.

48
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.300
It has actuators that do things
out in the real world and

49
00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.560
sensors that read data
from the real world.

50
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.860
So, sensors meaning buttons and things
like this, light sensors, sound sensors,

51
00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.800
microphones, whatever you want.

52
00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.170
And then has actuators, speakers,
screen, that type of thing.

53
00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.530
And so the Raspberry Pi is directly
interfacing with the real world through

54
00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:51.940
these sensors and actuators.

55
00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.440
And it's trading data with some
servers based in the internet,

56
00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.930
some servers connected by the internet.

57
00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.290
So you get this, the whole system that the
person is interacting with is much bigger.

58
00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.910
It's not just the Raspberry Pi.

59
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:09.505
Is this whole network infrastructure that
include some service on the network.

60
00:03:10.878 --> 00:03:14.100
So, first we talk a little
bit about the Internet.

61
00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.750
We need to explain what the Internet
looks like in order to have you

62
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.660
writing code that actually
accesses the internet.

63
00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:20.930
So, the internet.

64
00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.840
The structure of the internet
is relatively ad hoc.

65
00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.470
Not completely but remember that's
it's not completely controlled.

66
00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:32.420
At any time, I can open up a laptop and
have it connect onto the network and

67
00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.330
now it is a node on the internet.

68
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.750
And then I can close that laptop and
it is no longer node on the internet, or

69
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.950
I can say, look I'm going to buy
a router and turn on my router and

70
00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.040
connect ten machines to
the Internet through my router.

71
00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.100
So the structure of the Internet
is not a fixed thing,

72
00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.310
it's not centrally controlled.

73
00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.840
It's controlled locally by
all sorts of random people.

74
00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.500
Anybody who wants to start a connection,

75
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.740
has a little money,
can spring up their own little subnetwork.

76
00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.640
So you've got this set of
local area networks, LANs,

77
00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.450
we're calling them, L-A-Ns,
local area networks.

78
00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.610
And those things are out of control.

79
00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.710
You don't know what those things
look like, what protocols they use.

80
00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:10.500
That's up to whatever the locality is.

81
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.870
I mean there are certain standards,

82
00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.240
but people don't have to adhere
to those standards necessarily.

83
00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.280
So everybody has their own local area
networks, and these are all somehow

84
00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.470
tied together into one massive internet,
and they all have to talk together.

85
00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.420
So these local area networks
are connected by, well,

86
00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.910
I'm drawing a sort of hierarchy
of routers in this picture.

87
00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.190
Doesn't have to be routers, it can be
switches and bridges and things like this.

88
00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:35.340
But networking infrastructure,
a hierarchy of this, a massive hierarchy,

89
00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.660
that all communicate together
to form the internet.

90
00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:42.560
Now this is a vast simplification.

91
00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.250
But the general idea is at the bottom,

92
00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.280
the local area network level,
that's out of control.

93
00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.270
At the top level there's gotta
be some structure imposed so

94
00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:52.610
that everybody can talk together.

95
00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.670
So, the structure in post, the way
everybody, all these random local area

96
00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:02.600
networks talk together is through
the use of these internet protocols.

97
00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.790
So, you need to send data from one
local area network to another,

98
00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:07.830
and you don't have control over
the individual networks, but

99
00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.890
they still need to communicate somehow.

100
00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:10.800
So how do you do this?

101
00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.890
Generally you use a protocol,
internet protocols.

102
00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:19.590
Now, a protocol is basically a set of
rules that define a lot of things.

103
00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:20.720
They define the communication.

104
00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.770
So, they define how data should be
transferred between two different nodes.

105
00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:26.960
They define what data is
contained in each packet.

106
00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.620
They define what's in the header,
they define a lot.

107
00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.150
But the protocol defines
how you should communicate.

108
00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.090
Just to give you a little example,

109
00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.610
you ever see movies where
people talk on a CB radio?

110
00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:42.970
And they say either talk, and every
time their done talking they say over.

111
00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:45.860
And then the next person's allowed
to talk, and then they talk and

112
00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.040
they say over.

113
00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.270
That's protocol, and protocol is you
say whatever you want to say and

114
00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:53.030
then you say over to let
the other person know you are done

115
00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:55.020
with whatever you're saying,
and they can talk.

116
00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.680
And the reason why you have that protocol
is to share the communication lines,

117
00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:03.650
because basically with a radio like
that you have one set of lines,

118
00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:05.210
one communication channel.

119
00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:07.270
So, only one person can
be talking at a time.

120
00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:10.450
So, you need some signal to let
the other person know, okay I am done,

121
00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:13.820
I am relinquishing control of this bus so
that you can talk now.

122
00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:15.480
So, that's why you say, over.

123
00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.010
And then when you're done with all your
communication you say over and out,

124
00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:20.380
meaning you want to end
communication completely.

125
00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:21.970
And that's called a protocol.

126
00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:24.730
It defines basically how you're
supposed to communicate.

127
00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:25.770
It gives you some rules.

128
00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:27.100
Now it doesn't define everything.

129
00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:28.740
It doesn't define what you can say.

130
00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:31.920
You can put any data inside the payload.

131
00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:32.680
The words you say,

132
00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:36.340
you can say whatever you want as
long as at the end you say over.

133
00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:38.950
Or at the end of the whole
communication you say over and out.

134
00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:40.150
So that's a protocol.

135
00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:43.190
And the network's the same thing.

136
00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:47.810
Usually the exterior information isn't
at the beginning, isn't at the end,

137
00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:48.890
but the beginning.

138
00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:52.040
So with this example that I'm
giving here with over and

139
00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.170
out, you say that after you're
done with your payload.

140
00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:55.040
You say your payload.

141
00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.130
Then you say over.

142
00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:57.040
So that's a footer.

143
00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.900
They call that a footer
because it's at the end.

144
00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:02.460
Usually in the Internet most of these
network protocols you have headers, so

145
00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:05.660
you put that network information
at the beginning of the pack and

146
00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:08.350
you say, things like what's
the destination address?

147
00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:10.000
You put that at the beginning.

148
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.780
What's the size of all the data?

149
00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:12.690
You put that at the beginning.

150
00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:15.050
Things like this, you put this
information at the beginning and

151
00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:16.620
then you put your payload out there.

152
00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:18.380
But it's the same idea.

153
00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:22.850
So, there I said are these internet
protocols and the idea is in order for

154
00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:26.590
two machines on two random local area
networks to communicate they have to

155
00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:28.480
adhere to these internet protocols.

156
00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:29.860
So, when they want to talk,

157
00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:32.670
when one machine from one local area
network wants to talk to another machine

158
00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:37.410
from another local area network
it has to adhere to the protocol.

159
00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:41.830
It has to encapsulate data the way
that the Internet protocol dictates.

160
00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:43.290
And as long as it does that,

161
00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:45.910
the machine at the receiving end
will understand that data and

162
00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:51.380
be able to pull out the information
that it needs, and they can communicate.

163
00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:53.850
And these protocols don't
interfere with the LAN protocol.

164
00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:56.470
So these local area networks, they can
have whatever protocols they want.

165
00:07:57.850 --> 00:08:00.540
So that we would call
the payload of the message.

166
00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:03.350
They can have whatever
information in them they want,

167
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:07.060
as long as you put the special header for
the Internet protocol

168
00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:09.960
on the outside of all that you
can send whatever data you want.

169
00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:13.031
So the local area networks can have
whatever random protocols they want to

170
00:08:13.031 --> 00:08:15.408
have as long as you adhere to
these Internet protocols and

171
00:08:15.408 --> 00:08:18.254
put their headers on the front and
footers if you have to on the back.

172
00:08:18.254 --> 00:08:21.379
Then two machines can communicate.

173
00:08:21.379 --> 00:08:29.295
Thank you.
