2
00:00:11.326 --> 00:00:15.522
This module is an introduction
to the C programming language.

3
00:00:15.522 --> 00:00:20.510
So the Arduino programs that you're
gonna write, they're all in C.

4
00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:21.760
C, C++, but basically C.

5
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.110
So, we're just gonna introduce C.

6
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.310
And so this whole module is just
about all the basic constructs of C.

7
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.120
How you write basic C.

8
00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.180
And we're gonna limit ourselves.

9
00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.250
We won't talk about all of C.

10
00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.640
C is a big detailed language.

11
00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.490
But we're gonna talk
about all of the stuff,

12
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.630
or most of the stuff that you would
ever use in an Arduino program.

13
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.746
So that's what this is,
just an introduction to C.

14
00:00:44.746 --> 00:00:45.686
Thank you.
