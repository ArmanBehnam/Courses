2
00:00:11.624 --> 00:00:14.060
So this lecture will talk
about the Arduino schematics.

3
00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:16.570
The schematics of
the actual Arduino board.

4
00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.350
This is definitely, somewhat advanced.

5
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.870
We’re not going to be
modifying the schematics but

6
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:23.680
it’s still very useful to look at.

7
00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.990
Because understanding schematics, being
able to read them, is a very useful skill.

8
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:34.280
Because often, I find,
whenever I make any new design the first

9
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.570
thing I do is look for people who have
already made similar designs, right.

10
00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.040
So I go on the internet and
look around, and

11
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.170
has anybody ever done anything like this.

12
00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.860
And you find DIY projects, do it yourself
projects that are up there online.

13
00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.920
And the traditional way to
convey a hardware design is

14
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.260
to draw you a schematic.

15
00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:51.910
They say, look,
here's how we've wired everything.

16
00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.160
That's what a schematic is, it's a diagram
of what the components are on the device

17
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.010
and how they're wired together.

18
00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.270
I said, you can copy that.

19
00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.270
So, often I find myself looking at
schematics and then copying them.

20
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.370
Implementing, wiring things
together according to schematic.

21
00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.830
So you have to be able to read these
schematics in order to do that.

22
00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.721
So, it's a very useful thing to be able
to do, so we'll look at doing arduino

23
00:01:11.721 --> 00:01:14.760
schematic a little bit, since it's an open
source schematic and we can do that.

24
00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.700
So this is the schematic for

25
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.960
the Arduino UNO revision three, rev three,
which is what you probably are using.

26
00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.270
The Arduino designs are open source, so
this hardware schematic is open source.

27
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.680
And you can download this
off arduino.cc website.

28
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:31.650
You could build your own.

29
00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.020
You could take that schematic and
design your own circuit,

30
00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.150
wire it together if you wanted to.

31
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.840
Now you'll notice,
this is a little bit smaller to read,

32
00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.360
but it's got a lot of
different components.

33
00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.570
We won't go through everything, but
we'll go through sort of the big pieces in

34
00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.620
there, just to describe what they are and
how they relate to the board.

35
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.320
Because all of the components that you
see in this schematic are on the physical

36
00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.720
development board that you have.

37
00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:53.930
So they're all on there.

38
00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:54.950
Notice one thing too,

39
00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.270
that the layout here, the layout that
you see them draw on the schematic

40
00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.520
has nothing to do with how they are laid
out on the actual board, right?

41
00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.920
When they lay them out on the physical
board, the layout is done the placement,

42
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.200
placing the parts,
is done in such a way to make it compact.

43
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.140
Where on a screen when you see
a schematic, you're not necessarily

44
00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.440
worried about compactness,
you want it to be more readable.

45
00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.440
Right?
So, it's laid out in a completely

46
00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.230
different fashion in the schematic than
it actually is on the physical board.

47
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.350
Now if you want to see the actual board
layout, the eagle files, the cat files for

48
00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.400
that, they are available on Arduino.cc and
they are harder to read,

49
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.500
but you can look at that.

50
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.300
But this is not that.

51
00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.800
This is just a wiring
schematic that shows you what

52
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.650
components should be connected to what.

53
00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.260
And what pins should be
connected to what pins.

54
00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.120
So, let's look at it in
a little more detail.

55
00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.650
Okay, so if you look at the schematic,

56
00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.520
we've highlighted a few
interesting things here.

57
00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.340
First things we've highlighted
are the processors.

58
00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.350
So like we said, there are two
microcontrollers on this device.

59
00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.270
There's the ATmega328, which is the main
one that you're gonna be programming.

60
00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.330
And then there's the ATmega16U2
that deals with the USB connection.

61
00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.760
So you can see both of those
are highlighted in the picture And

62
00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.890
actually, from the look of it,
it looks like the ATmega16U2 is bigger.

63
00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.090
It's not bigger [LAUGH].

64
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.230
This is not drawn to scale.

65
00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.360
So the ATmega16U2 is actually
a smaller chip on the board.

66
00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.750
But that doesn't matter.

67
00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.380
It's bigger because the text
is bigger inside the box.

68
00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.710
And you'll notice that each
one of these components,

69
00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:26.010
they label each one of the pins.

70
00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.040
So you can see their names for

71
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.930
each one of the pins that tell you
what pins are being wired to what.

72
00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.380
Also, you could see the pins to the board,
so the Adruino board,

73
00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:36.490
are also highlighted.

74
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:40.330
So the power pins, the analog in pins,
and the digital i o pins.

75
00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.440
You can see all those wired there,
too, or highlighted there, too.

76
00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:50.030
Those relate directly to components
that you see on the board,

77
00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:51.300
that we saw on the board already.

78
00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:54.670
Now in addition to these, what do we have.

79
00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:55.950
Here's some more interesting parts.

80
00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.610
Power connector, so remember we saw
the power connector on the board,

81
00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:00.030
there it is highlighted.

82
00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.890
The ICSP headers, ICSP1 ICSP2 those
two headers that are used for

83
00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.510
programming the firmware on the two
processors, those are highlighted there.

84
00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.060
The USB connector you can see that.

85
00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.500
And just for a reference sake,
cuz he had to make a 328 again.

86
00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.500
So those are most of the big
parts that are on the board and

87
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.340
that you can see in the schematic.

88
00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.050
There are a bunch of little parts in
there, LEDs and things like this,

89
00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.840
resistors, little components too, but
we're not gonna go enumerate all of them.

90
00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.640
But the idea though, is that the whole
point of the schematic is to show you how

91
00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:31.638
everything is wired together.

92
00:04:31.638 --> 00:04:32.138
Thank you.

93
00:04:32.138 --> 00:04:42.138
