[MUSIC]

2
00:00:10.961 --> 00:00:15.830
So in this lesson, we'll talk about
the Arduino Environment in general.

3
00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.860
So that includes the Arduino itself,
but also the software environment and

4
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.310
the other hardware components that
you can add on to an Arduino.

5
00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:23.480
We'll introduce those right here.

6
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:29.190
So, the Arduino Environment starts off
with the Arduino development board itself.

7
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:30.190
It looks like this.

8
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.650
Now, the development board,
it's got an eight bit microcontroller.

9
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.940
And actually,
when you get your development board,

10
00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.390
it might look different from this.

11
00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:39.790
They all look slightly different.

12
00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.070
Not they all, but this is an Arduino Uno.

13
00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.130
And the Arduino Uno, this is the one that
you should be getting if you get a new

14
00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.800
one, it should be version three.

15
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.750
And this one might be a little bit older,
but they all look very similar.

16
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.278
So there's an eight bit
microcontroller on there,

17
00:00:54.278 --> 00:00:57.040
the big chip you can see is
an eight bit microcontroller.

18
00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.250
And there are the chips in there
too to interact with the USB and

19
00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:01.410
things like this.

20
00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.630
There's other hardware on there, to allow
you to program the microcontroller.

21
00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:09.580
So through the USB, so the USB port,
you can see that at the top left.

22
00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.890
That is the cable that is going to
be connected to the desktop laptop.

23
00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.240
Your code will go across that
cable when you want to program it.

24
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.840
There is a chip in there that
communicates with the USB

25
00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.910
that allows the transferred
data to the microcontroller.

26
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.030
All right so
that's the USB programming interface,

27
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.640
there's also software on the Arduino,
the boot loader that handles that too.

28
00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:34.654
And there are IO pins.

29
00:01:34.654 --> 00:01:37.530
Now I/O pins, IO stands for input output.

30
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.650
The pins are the connection
to the outside world.

31
00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.220
So on the Arduino board you can see
them on the top and on the bottom,

32
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.660
that row on the top and
row on the bottom there, these holes.

33
00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.180
Maybe a little hard to see,
but there are holes on there.

34
00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:50.830
And those holes you can
stick wires in there,

35
00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.560
and those holes are directly wired through
the board to the pins of the chips.

36
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.290
So, if you look at that chip,
it's got these pins, these

37
00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.760
pieces of metal sticking out that are the
leads connected to the outside world.

38
00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.710
And those are wired through the board
through traces on the board to

39
00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:04.440
those holes.

40
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.770
So, by connecting wires to
those holes you can connect

41
00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.910
other the devices to the micro controller.

42
00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.000
So the Arduino development board
right there is the first component

43
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.720
in the environment.

44
00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:17.800
But that's not the whole thing.

45
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.870
Arduino also has a software environment,
an IDE.

46
00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:22.610
IDE stands for

47
00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.699
Integrated Development Environment and
you can see an image of it here.

48
00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.780
Basically what this is for is for coding.

49
00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.290
You write the code in there.

50
00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.910
And by the way, technically you
don't have to use the Arduino IDE.

51
00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.710
You could program an Arduino using
eclipse or some other IDE if you want to.

52
00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.360
We're gonna go with the Arduino IDE.

53
00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.020
It's easier, it's easier to handle.

54
00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.590
Arduino eclipses more, it's more
versatile and it can do a lot of things.

55
00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.650
And if you're very used to it, then okay.

56
00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.170
But we're gonna go with the Arduino IDE.

57
00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.920
You can write code in there,
you can compile the code.

58
00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.580
You can program it,
upload it to your board, things like that.

59
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.570
We're not seeing the whole thing, but
we'll go through it in slides later.

60
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.290
But this is an important
part of the environment.

61
00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.060
You download this from the website,
arduino.cc.

62
00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.880
You go there, you download this,
you install it on your machine.

63
00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.790
It works on every platform,
Windows, Linux.

64
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:16.290
Mac.

65
00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.410
And maybe Android,
I don't know, I have to check.

66
00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.790
But Arduino Environment,
you download this and install it.

67
00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.070
It's got the cross compiler.

68
00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:29.630
Means it can take your code,
your Arduino sketch, and compiles it for

69
00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:30.700
the target platform.

70
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.020
Which is the Arduino's processor.

71
00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.650
The ATmegathree28.

72
00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.060
Also it's got a debugger in there.

73
00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.180
It's got a little bit of a simulator.

74
00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.450
It's got a programmer so

75
00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:46.090
it allows you to actually copy your code,
copy the executable code onto the Arduino.

76
00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.920
So we'll be using that and that's
an important part of the environment.

77
00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.180
We'll go through it in
detail in later slides.

78
00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.270
So, so far we've got
the Arduino development board,

79
00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:59.060
we've got the Arduino IDE,
which you see here for programming.

80
00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.360
Also, you've got the shields,
what they call Arduino shields.

81
00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.540
Now, these shields,

82
00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.800
this is one of the things that
people really like about Arduino.

83
00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:08.980
The reason why Arduino's gotten so

84
00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.632
popular is because people can use
Arduino to build hardware systems,

85
00:04:12.632 --> 00:04:16.450
hardware software systems, without
knowing hardly anything about hardware.

86
00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:19.010
And part of the way they do
that is with these shields.

87
00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.650
So, when you actually wanna do make a more
complicated system you need complicated

88
00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:24.360
devices.

89
00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.010
Complicated integrated circuits.

90
00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.860
So actually if you look here,
you've got a stack of three boards.

91
00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.580
It's a little hard to see but
there's a stack of three boards.

92
00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.400
On the top is actually
the ethernet controller shield.

93
00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.420
And we'll work with this
later in the course.

94
00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.960
But the Ethernet controller
shield It's got an Ethernet jack

95
00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.460
which you can connect to the Ethernet
with, a wired connection.

96
00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.020
And in the middle of that there's a chip,

97
00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.470
an integrated circuit which is
called an Ethernet controller.

98
00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.320
And it is needed to manage
the Ethernet connection.

99
00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.860
Now, if you were to do this from scratch,

100
00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.230
connect to an Ethernet controller chip,
it would be a lot of work.

101
00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:57.160
The data sheet on that
Ethernet controller, actually,

102
00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.880
I think I've used that
Ethernet controller.

103
00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.690
Separately.
I had a student group do it and

104
00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.630
it's hundreds of pages for
that data sheet.

105
00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:03.530
It's very complicated.

106
00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:04.660
There's a lot of wiring.

107
00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.630
The thing looks like it
has 80 pins on the side.

108
00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:08.900
You gotta wire all that up.

109
00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.810
It's a lot of wiring and
it's a lot of coding.

110
00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.830
But what happens with these shields is
they basically pre wire everything.

111
00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:19.830
So they give you a board, a little shield,
which has the chip on there pre wired.

112
00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.370
You take that board,
you stack it on top of the Arduino.

113
00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.020
So it has pins going out underneath
the board, and you stack it on top.

114
00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.860
It goes into the holes
on the Arduino board.

115
00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.390
So it is immediately just wired for
you to the Arduino.

116
00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:34.470
You don't have to do any work, all right?

117
00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:36.650
You don't have to have any
knowledge about the wiring.

118
00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:39.790
So it's prewired for you and
it comes with a set of libraries.

119
00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:41.420
And we'll get into more
depth about these later.

120
00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.600
But it comes with a set of
functions that are premade,

121
00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.260
that do everything
interesting you need to do.

122
00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.830
So you don't have to understand
almost anything about

123
00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:52.990
what the ethernet controller chip does and
how it works.

124
00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.940
You can just call these library functions
and they will send messages and

125
00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:57.160
do all the basic things.

126
00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.760
And it makes it very simple for you, even
if you don't know anything about hardware.

127
00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.850
So, this is another important
part of the environment.

128
00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:04.810
It's part of why Arduino is so popular.

129
00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:05.820
So, Arduino environment.

130
00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:07.460
If you look at it,
you've got the development board.

131
00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.030
You got the IDE for writing code.

132
00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:11.020
And you've got the shields.

133
00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:14.850
A variety of shields from different third
party vendors that you can buy, that come

134
00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:17.929
with libraries that make interacting with
different pieces of hardware very easy.

135
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.186
So let's look a little more
at the development board.

136
00:06:22.186 --> 00:06:27.120
It's got a microcontroller,
it's got a USB interface to a PC.

137
00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:31.250
Large open source community, so the board
itself it's an open source design.

138
00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:33.850
What that means is that
if you go to arduino.cc,

139
00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:38.800
go to their website,
you'll find the schematics for that board.

140
00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.370
You'll find, in fact I think we
showed it in our earlier slides.

141
00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:43.610
Where you'll find the schematics for
that board,

142
00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:46.530
the different components on that board and
how they are wired together so

143
00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:50.060
if you wanted to, if you have a mind
to do it, you could take that and

144
00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:52.530
design your own board,
because it's open source.

145
00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:53.900
It's open design.

146
00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:55.590
Don't do that, it's expensive.

147
00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:57.370
It's much cheaper to just
buy the pre made board.

148
00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:00.740
But you could go ahead and
take that board design and

149
00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:03.810
build your own if you wanted to do
it cheaply or something like that.

150
00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:05.330
You could modify it if you wanted to.

151
00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:06.420
So it's an open source design.

152
00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:10.340
And there's a large open source
community in there that uses it.

153
00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:12.020
The hardware's open source,
also the software.

154
00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:15.280
That IDE that we saw,
that's also open source.

155
00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.510
It's written in Java and
it's open source so you can take that and

156
00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:18.400
modify it if you want to.

157
00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.310
So let's start right here
looking at the board,

158
00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:24.850
the different components on the board.

159
00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:27.580
We've got a reset button.

160
00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.360
That just resets the device.

161
00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.650
USB connection, power connection.

162
00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:34.800
So the power is an external power.

163
00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:40.450
We won't be needing it, I don't think,
because USB can also provide power.

164
00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:43.990
So unless you're connecting the arduino
to something more heavy duty,

165
00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:46.220
