2
00:00:11.331 --> 00:00:14.537
In this module we'll be
introducing the Arduino IDE,

3
00:00:14.537 --> 00:00:18.930
actually the entire Arduino environment
which involves the IDE, which is

4
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.551
a software interface where you write
the code and you compile it and upload it.

5
00:00:23.551 --> 00:00:27.781
The Arduino board is another element
of the Arduino environment, and

6
00:00:27.781 --> 00:00:32.227
that actually involves a chip and
the program that executes the code, but

7
00:00:32.227 --> 00:00:33.891
also the Arduino shields.

8
00:00:33.891 --> 00:00:37.751
The Arduino compatible shield, so
a shield is basically add-on hardware.

9
00:00:37.751 --> 00:00:41.723
It comes, then you stack on top of
the board, and you use that with,

10
00:00:41.723 --> 00:00:46.491
via library so you get a set of Arduino
libraries, associated with each shield.

11
00:00:46.491 --> 00:00:49.449
So really the Arduino environment
has three components,

12
00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:52.588
the IDE for programming,
the board itself, and the shields, and

13
00:00:52.588 --> 00:00:56.531
we'll just outline all those and
talk about how they all work together.

14
00:00:56.531 --> 00:00:57.651
Thank you.
