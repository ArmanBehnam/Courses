2
00:00:14.921 --> 00:00:18.890
Module one, Lesson three,
Lecture 3.2, Arduino Basic Setup.

3
00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:21.810
So, right here,

4
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.290
we're gonna talk about how you set up your
Arduino environment in the first place.

5
00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.090
We'll just go through the basic set up,
and

6
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.110
we'll have you install
the Arduino environment, and

7
00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.330
then run a program just as a sanity check
to see that you got it all installed.

8
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.930
And you should definitely do this
first thing you get your Arduino.

9
00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.270
You should do this just to make sure
the whole setup is working cleanly.

10
00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.620
So, setting up the Arduino IDE.

11
00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.290
You wanna download it first.

12
00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.992
So, you go to arduino.cc specifically,

13
00:00:52.992 --> 00:00:58.580
on the link that's shown there,
arduino.cc/en/Main/Software.

14
00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.570
Or just go to arduino.cc and
at the top there's a download button and

15
00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.100
it'll get you there.

16
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.360
So easiest to run the installer.

17
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.360
Now I'm using Windows so say Windows
installer but you can do this on Mac and

18
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.730
on Linux as well.

19
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:11.590
So you run the installer.

20
00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.266
Now that will automatically install
all the drivers that you need,

21
00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:17.922
specifically the USB driver and
other drivers.

22
00:01:17.922 --> 00:01:21.397
Drivers are basically software
code that runs on your

23
00:01:21.397 --> 00:01:24.337
machine to communicate with other devices.

24
00:01:24.337 --> 00:01:25.004
Okay?

25
00:01:25.004 --> 00:01:27.810
So on your desktop, laptop.

26
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.400
Right?
So it'll have drivers.

27
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.950
Any operating system has a set of drivers.

28
00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.760
So there'll be drivers to talk
to the USB port on the Arduino.

29
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.350
So this, if you just run the install,
it will automatically, when it asks you,

30
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.910
should I install the USB drivers, yes.

31
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:43.745
Any drivers it says, okay, okay, okay.

32
00:01:43.745 --> 00:01:46.220
So, you install those and actually,

33
00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.210
this process has gotten
much better over the years.

34
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.250
It used to be error filled.

35
00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.560
Right?
But now it's pretty clean.

36
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.520
Okay, then connect your
board to the computer yards.

37
00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.400
We know board to the computer.

38
00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.930
Use a USB cable, connect it.

39
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.830
Launch the Arduino application.

40
00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.610
So start the IDE however
you wanna start it.

41
00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.680
Maybe you have a desktop icon,
you double click on it or do a search,

42
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.530
find search for Arduino and
double-click on it.

43
00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.530
So you start the IDE
with the board connected.

44
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.900
Now when you start it, first you
get the image you see on the left.

45
00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.590
You're gonna get basically
an empty screen.

46
00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.560
It's not completely empty, this one has
sort of a shell set up and a void, but

47
00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.900
there's no code inside there.

48
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:25.650
Right?
They're blank.

49
00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.110
So you start off with
something blank like that, and

50
00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.760
if you wanted to you could write code and
fill in the blanks.

51
00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.880
Write all your code right in there.

52
00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.796
That's not gonna be the first
thing you're gonna do.

53
00:02:35.796 --> 00:02:39.642
First thing you wanna
do is basically upload,

54
00:02:39.642 --> 00:02:44.170
open a sample problem,
a sample file, and run that.

55
00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.430
Just as a sanity check to see that
your whole system is working.

56
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.200
Now the Arduino comes with this whole,
a big set of examples.

57
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.020
Example programs that should work.

58
00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.620
So I'll advise you to look
at the Blink example.

59
00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:58.380
So go to file.

60
00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.754
Go to the file, pull down file,
examples, basics, and blink.

61
00:03:02.754 --> 00:03:05.000
There's a program called Blink,
you click on that.

62
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.440
Then you'll get the image
you see on the right.

63
00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.870
It'll open up the Blink code.

64
00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.850
Now, that's the just beginning
of the Blink code, but

65
00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:12.421
there's a little bit
more of it down there.

66
00:03:12.421 --> 00:03:16.796
But it'll open up a new window
with the Blink code in it.

67
00:03:16.796 --> 00:03:20.255
Now, then what your goal's gonna
be is to run that program.

68
00:03:20.255 --> 00:03:23.185
And what it should do, it should
make an LED Blink on the Arduino.

69
00:03:23.185 --> 00:03:26.755
Okay, and then you know my
setup is working correctly.

70
00:03:26.755 --> 00:03:30.156
So in order to get to that
point where you run the code,

71
00:03:30.156 --> 00:03:35.462
first you wanna make sure that the machine
has recognized your Arduino correctly.

72
00:03:35.462 --> 00:03:37.680
Now this you may not have to do.

73
00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.178
It may if you're happy,
if you're lucky, it may just,

74
00:03:40.178 --> 00:03:43.421
as soon as you plug it in your OS will
detect it and everything will be fine.

75
00:03:43.421 --> 00:03:47.465
But here are some checks you
typically do before you program,

76
00:03:47.465 --> 00:03:51.212
first select your Arduino
board in the Tools Board menu.

77
00:03:51.212 --> 00:03:57.171
So if you to Tools and go to the board
link it lists a bunch of Arduino boards.

78
00:03:57.171 --> 00:03:59.254
Arduino Uno is typically what
you are going to be using.

79
00:03:59.254 --> 00:04:02.675
But there are many
variants on Arduino board.

80
00:04:02.675 --> 00:04:05.370
Arduino Lilypad,
Arduino Duemilanove and all this.

81
00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.245
So, there'll be a whole bunch of them,
and hopefully,

82
00:04:08.245 --> 00:04:12.695
usually it detects it automatically and
highlights the one that you are using.

83
00:04:12.695 --> 00:04:14.525
But just in case it didn't
you go in there and

84
00:04:14.525 --> 00:04:16.600
you select the one that you are using,
Arduino Uno let's say.

85
00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:22.100
Then you wanna select your serial
port in the tools ports menu.

86
00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.840
Serial port, this is more detailed
than I wanna get into, but

87
00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.830
there are these COM ports, communication
ports, on any windows machine.

88
00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.412
And the windows machine should,
when you plug in an external device,

89
00:04:35.412 --> 00:04:39.254
it should automatically map the external
device to a particular COM port.

90
00:04:39.254 --> 00:04:42.337
Whichever one is available,
first one to find is available.

91
00:04:42.337 --> 00:04:46.831
So, if this is working right there should
be, when you look at the tools port menu,

92
00:04:46.831 --> 00:04:49.100
there should be one option there.

93
00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.458
Say COM3 or COM5 or whatever's available,
there should be one option and

94
00:04:52.458 --> 00:04:53.510
you select it.

95
00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:55.960
Okay?
And that should be all there is to it.

96
00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.480
Sometimes there's multiple options and
then the easiest thing to do,

97
00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.740
there's a way to figure out
which one is the right one, but

98
00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.060
the easiest thing to do is just guess.

99
00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.100
Try one and program it and
see what happens, if it fails, try again.

100
00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.546
But there should be one option,
and you select it.

101
00:05:08.546 --> 00:05:13.962
If there's no option, then probably the
USB drivers are not installed correctly.

102
00:05:13.962 --> 00:05:16.880
Okay?

103
00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.260
So then once you've selected the serial
port, then you upload the program.

104
00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:21.550
You press the Upload button.

105
00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:25.130
Now, you press the Upload button on
the IDE, it will compile the program,

106
00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:28.090
checking for errors and
the Blink program will have no errors.

107
00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.430
It will compile it and
then it will upload it.

108
00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.640
When it's done,
that'll take several seconds.

109
00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.750
Okay, ten seconds, let's say.

110
00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:37.990
Some lights will blink on
the board quickly, and

111
00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.890
then they should stop blinking,
and it should be programmed.

112
00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:43.940
And you should see a little
message that says done uploading.

113
00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:47.000
When that happens,
as soon as that happens, the Arduino will

114
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.420
start executing the program, as soon as
it's done programming, done uploading.

115
00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:56.670
So, what should happen, is there's an LED
panel on the board next to the pin 13,

116
00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:00.796
digital pin 13 and it should
start blinking once every second.

117
00:06:00.796 --> 00:06:04.591
And if it had happens, then you
know that your install is right and

118
00:06:04.591 --> 00:06:06.046
everything is working.

119
00:06:06.046 --> 00:06:08.672
So you should do that as
soon as you get your stuff.

120
00:06:08.672 --> 00:06:09.712
Thank you.

121
00:06:09.712 --> 00:06:14.629
