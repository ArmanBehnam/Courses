2
00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:15.876
In this module, we'll be talking
about debugging, in general, and

3
00:00:15.876 --> 00:00:18.850
how you're going to do it on the Arduino.

4
00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.356
Now, we're not talking about
debugging the entire IOT system,

5
00:00:22.356 --> 00:00:25.617
because the entire system has software and
it has hardware.

6
00:00:25.617 --> 00:00:28.902
And we haven't gotten to the hardware
aspects yet, but we're just gonna talk

7
00:00:28.902 --> 00:00:32.260
about the software and some of the things
we're gonna do to debug the software.

8
00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:36.335
So we'll talk about debugging in general,
how you do it in IOT devices and

9
00:00:36.335 --> 00:00:37.930
embed devices in general.

10
00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.930
But then we'll focus in on how
we're gonna do it on the Arduino.

11
00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.930
And a lot of that will be about
using the serial interface.

12
00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.775
Serial interface to transmit data and
debug data from the Arduino to the host so

13
00:00:47.775 --> 00:00:51.165
that you can figure out what's going
inside your code when it fails.

14
00:00:51.165 --> 00:00:51.885
Thank you.
