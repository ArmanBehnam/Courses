00:00:11.063 --> 00:00:16.280
In this module, we're going to be
talking about the Arduino Programs and

3
00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.610
the build process.

4
00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:23.655
So, an Arduino program is called a sketch
and it is basically a C++ program,

5
00:00:23.655 --> 00:00:27.160
C/C++ program, with certain constraints.

6
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.150
And so we'll talk about what
those constraints are, so

7
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.500
how the program that
you're gonna write for

8
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.626
an Arduino is gonna be different
than your standard C/C++ program.

9
00:00:35.626 --> 00:00:39.010
And there are certain functions
that you have to include.

10
00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.520
Certain library functions
that you have to use.

11
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.950
So we'll talk about those.

12
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.430
Also, we'll talk about the build process.

13
00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.760
The build process is everything
that takes that C/C++,

14
00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.370
that sketch program that you wrote, and
puts it on to the Arduino for execution.

15
00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:55.560
So, everything in there.

16
00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.410
The compilation, the combining,
the transformation, uploading.

17
00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.400
That process, we'll talk about that
process in a little bit detail.

18
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.650
And that's especially useful, so
when things go wrong with that process,

19
00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.148
you can have some sense of
what's going on and fix it.

20
00:01:08.148 --> 00:01:08.760
Thank you.
