00:00:11.478 --> 00:00:15.765
In this demonstration we're just going to
wire a very simple circuit connected to

3
00:00:15.765 --> 00:00:17.340
the Arduino.

4
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.604
All we're gonna do is the blinking light
example, which we've already done.

5
00:00:20.604 --> 00:00:25.190
Except we're gonna have the Arduino blink
an LED that is not built into the Arduino.

6
00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.438
So we're just gonna walk through this,
just so

7
00:00:28.438 --> 00:00:31.727
you get the idea of how you connect
something to the Arduino and make it work.

8
00:00:31.727 --> 00:00:33.865
And if you look at the Arduino right now.

9
00:00:33.865 --> 00:00:37.145
It is now plugged into through USB,
so it's getting power.

10
00:00:37.145 --> 00:00:40.115
And it's already running
the blinking example, so

11
00:00:40.115 --> 00:00:43.255
you can see the little LED on
there blinking off and on.

12
00:00:43.255 --> 00:00:45.901
That's the LED that's connected to pin 13.

13
00:00:45.901 --> 00:00:47.755
That's blinking off and on.

14
00:00:47.755 --> 00:00:49.345
Just to let you know, that program,

15
00:00:49.345 --> 00:00:52.015
that's exactly what's running
in the Arduino right now.

16
00:00:52.015 --> 00:00:55.282
So, before we wire this together I will

17
00:00:55.282 --> 00:01:00.235
disconnect the Arduino from power,
that's always safe.

18
00:01:00.235 --> 00:01:02.470
Okay, so we'll put that to the side for
a second.

19
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.077
Now, let's look at the other
components we've got.

20
00:01:06.077 --> 00:01:09.586
We've got an LED right here.

21
00:01:09.586 --> 00:01:11.444
There we go, LED.

22
00:01:11.444 --> 00:01:16.064
We've got a resistor,
this is 220 ohm resistor.

23
00:01:16.064 --> 00:01:17.783
There we are.

24
00:01:17.783 --> 00:01:22.090
The two leads resistor.

25
00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.575
And we got a couple of wires,
red one, and black.

26
00:01:27.575 --> 00:01:29.482
Right, got some wires.

27
00:01:29.482 --> 00:01:31.804
So we're gonna wire this together.

28
00:01:31.804 --> 00:01:36.900
What we wanna do is, we wanna connect
this LED up to pin 13 of our Arduino.

29
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.937
So one side of the LED has to be connected
to pin 13, the anode, the positive side.

30
00:01:43.937 --> 00:01:48.120
The negative side is gonna be connected
through the resistor to the ground.

31
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.380
Now why through the resistor?

32
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.160
The reason why we have to connect
it through the resistor is because

33
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.740
if we don't, then our circuit
will have very little resistance.

34
00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.075
Just very low resistance,
whatever's in the LED.

35
00:01:59.075 --> 00:02:02.590
You'll have so little resistance that
will have a lot of current going through.

36
00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.150
And this LED is rated at
20 milliamps I believe, so

37
00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.300
if we drive it with more than 20
milliamps we will likely destroy it.

38
00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.892
So we need to give it some resistance
just to reduce the amount of current.

39
00:02:15.892 --> 00:02:19.889
220 ohm resistor right here
should be sufficient for that.

40
00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:21.590
So, let's wire them together.

41
00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.900
First, let's put the resistor in, and
we can plug it into two arbitrary holes.

42
00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.500
Okay, so we've plugged it into two holes.

43
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.870
Here and here, you can see that.

44
00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.050
Then I will take the LED.

45
00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.200
Now the LED,
we need to connect it to the resistor, but

46
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.140
we need to connect
the cathode to the resistor.

47
00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.113
The anode we wanna connect to pin 13.

48
00:02:43.113 --> 00:02:48.790
So the cathode, we look at this,
a little hard to see around my hand here.

49
00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.900
One leg is shorter than the other.

50
00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.530
So the short leg is the cathode,

51
00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.280
that's gonna go to negative side,
toward the ground.

52
00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.710
And the long leg, the anode,
is the positive side,

53
00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:00.908
that's gonna go to the pin 13.

54
00:03:00.908 --> 00:03:08.361
So, take and plug in the short legged
side into the same row as the resistor.

55
00:03:08.361 --> 00:03:09.917
Okay, so, now it is connected.

56
00:03:09.917 --> 00:03:12.440
They are on the same row so
they are connected.

57
00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.164
And the long leg side will just
shove in to any other row.

58
00:03:17.164 --> 00:03:19.740
Force that in here, there we go.

59
00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.140
Okay, so now we've got the LED
connected to the resistor.

60
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.118
But this is in no way connected to
the Arduino, so now let's go for that.

61
00:03:28.118 --> 00:03:34.241
We'll take our black wire and
connect that to one side of the resistor.

62
00:03:34.241 --> 00:03:35.750
And we're gonna connect that to ground.

63
00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.193
Now we're gonna get ground from Arduino,
so

64
00:03:38.193 --> 00:03:42.319
we have several grounds labeled on
the Arduino and here goes one right here.

65
00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:44.554
So just plug it in, yeah.

66
00:03:44.554 --> 00:03:49.384
Yeah, you can see wired into
the ground of the Arduino.

67
00:03:49.384 --> 00:03:52.860
So one end of the resistor is
connected to ground in the Arduino.

68
00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.830
Now the other wiring we need to do is
to take the LED, the anode runner.

69
00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.957
Plug this red into
the same row as the anode.

70
00:04:03.957 --> 00:04:07.040
And now connect the anode to pin 13.

71
00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.969
And what'll happen then, 13,
yep, what'll happen then is

72
00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:17.013
that when we power this on,
the LED on the board will still blink.

73
00:04:17.013 --> 00:04:22.400
But this other LED on the red board will
also blink, and they'll blink together.

74
00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.308
Because they're both connected to pin 13.

75
00:04:24.308 --> 00:04:27.520
That's what should happen,
so let's go and power up.

76
00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.538
Let's get our USB cable,

77
00:04:31.538 --> 00:04:36.293
connect the Arduino, power.

78
00:04:36.293 --> 00:04:40.560
And yes, yes indeed,
they are blinking together.

79
00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.417
As you can see, they both blink
together and everything worked.

80
00:04:46.604 --> 00:04:47.927
Thank you.

81
00:04:47.927 --> 00:04:52.249
