2
00:00:15.822 --> 00:00:19.340
Module three is about hardware and
software Internet of Things devices

3
00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.460
are built from hardware components and
software components working together.

4
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.760
You don't design them in isolation,

5
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.910
you design them together to
make them more efficient.

6
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.210
We'll talk about these
hardware components,

7
00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.580
software components, and how you
partition the behavior of the system.

8
00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.520
How do you decide what part
is implemented in hardware,

9
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.560
versus what part is
implemented in software.

10
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.830
So for instance hardware is typically
used to handle physical interaction.

11
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.000
The interaction with the physical world.

12
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.350
The sensors and actuators
are hardware components, typically.

13
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.280
Also hardware's needed, dedicated

14
00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.520
hardware would be needed to do the things
that are more computationally complex.

15
00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.400
Where software is used
to do the control and

16
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.140
also slower things,
human interactions, things like this.

17
00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.630
So, we'll talk about the hardware and the
software and how you design them together.

18
00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.050
We'll talk about the different types of
hardware components that are typical,

19
00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.950
that you find in these systems.

20
00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.030
We'll talk about the software
design process, too.

21
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.560
Compilation, interpretation,
that sort of thing.

22
00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.759
And how they come together
inside a microcontroller.

23
00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.030
Now in more complicated Internet of Things
components, you use an operating system.

24
00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.060
And people are already familiar with what
operating systems are, but they mean

25
00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.560
something a little bit different in
the context of Internet of Things devices.

26
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.082
So, we'll talk about operating systems,
and talk specifically about operating

27
00:01:32.082 --> 00:01:34.963
systems that are appropriate for
an Internet of Things component.
