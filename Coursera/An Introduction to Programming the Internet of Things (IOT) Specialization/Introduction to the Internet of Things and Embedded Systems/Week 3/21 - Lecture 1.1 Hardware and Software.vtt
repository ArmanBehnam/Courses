2
00:00:09.583 --> 00:00:14.470
So this lecture, we're gonna talk
about hardware and software systems.

3
00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:18.910
Internet of things devices, are typically
hardware and software combined.

4
00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.420
So as we're learning about
the IoT design process,

5
00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.710
we really have to think about
how you design hardware,

6
00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.900
how you design software, and
how do you design them to work together.

7
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.940
So you can't think of one in isolation,

8
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.980
you really need to think about both
together as you're working on the project.

9
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.607
So IoT devices are a combination
of hardware and software.

10
00:00:37.607 --> 00:00:41.823
There's always a hardware part of
the design and you can see that here,

11
00:00:41.823 --> 00:00:43.375
we've got a bread board.

12
00:00:43.375 --> 00:00:46.470
And the bread board's got
various components on it,

13
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:51.009
it's got a micro controllers, LED,
voltage regulator, capacitors I see,

14
00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:55.590
a bunch of different things, and
they're all mounted into this bread board.

15
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.030
One part of this design,
one aspect of the design,

16
00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.810
is a hardware aspect that you can see
right there and that's basically a bunch

17
00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:06.100
of components that are connected,
wired together in some fashion, okay?

18
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.390
So that's part of the design and
so a designer,

19
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.940
if you're gonna make an IoT device,
you have to think about that part too.

20
00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.100
But in addition to that, that alone
doesn't explain what the behavior is.

21
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.854
When you're looking at that
set of devices wired together,

22
00:01:18.854 --> 00:01:21.554
even completely understanding
what each component does,

23
00:01:21.554 --> 00:01:23.878
you can't tell what the behavior of that,
right?

24
00:01:23.878 --> 00:01:27.810
So you have an incomplete view of the
design if you only look at the hardware.

25
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.276
In addition to this, you gotta look at
the software component of this too.

26
00:01:32.276 --> 00:01:36.038
So if you look at the hardware side over
there, you've got at the center of it,

27
00:01:36.038 --> 00:01:37.637
there is this micro controller.

28
00:01:37.637 --> 00:01:39.452
That big black chip dead in the center,

29
00:01:39.452 --> 00:01:42.920
that is the micro controller
which is the heart of the system.

30
00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.906
And that micro controller executes code.

31
00:01:44.906 --> 00:01:46.210
And so there's gotta be some code,

32
00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.710
some software, which we can see
on the other side of the picture.

33
00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.530
Some software that's going to
run on that micro controller.

34
00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.330
Now that software is some sample code and
that's actually our Dwino code and

35
00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:57.420
we'll get to that later.

36
00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.160
But there's got to be some software
that's running on that micro controller,

37
00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.890
that talks to all
the different components.

38
00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.710
Talks to the LEDs, tells them when to
turn off and on and things like this.

39
00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.650
So there's this hardware side and
this software side and

40
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:12.700
these things have to work together.

41
00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.290
You've got to design both of them.

42
00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.102
So what I mean is when
you write the software,

43
00:02:16.102 --> 00:02:17.878
you have to be thinking
about the hardware.

44
00:02:17.878 --> 00:02:21.648
You have to say oh I've got an LED and it
needs to be controlled in this fashion, so

45
00:02:21.648 --> 00:02:23.151
I will write my code in this way.

46
00:02:23.151 --> 00:02:25.640
You have to be consciously aware of
that when you're doing the coding.

47
00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.286
Whenever you make a new project, you've
got a bunch of hardware components, right?

48
00:02:29.286 --> 00:02:32.260
You gotta get a bunch of hardware
components and wire them together and

49
00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.750
decide on that a priori.

50
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.100
What are the hardware
components going to be?

51
00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.010
Now, this is sort of a fundamental
issue with design projects in general,

52
00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:42.740
things change, right.

53
00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.480
So at first when you design something, you
have an idea of what the behavior is gonna

54
00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.590
be and you think you know
what the components will be.

55
00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.350
And then you start doing it,
you get into the design and

56
00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.030
often you have to back off track.

57
00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.490
You might implement something and realize,

58
00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.720
oh you know what I need a different
component this doesn't work for me.

59
00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.700
So that can happen,
there's always that risk.

60
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.780
But at the beginning to start building
your system you're going to have to have

61
00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.450
some idea of the type of
components that you're gonna need.

62
00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.150
So that's always a trial right, to figure
out which components you're gonna buy.

63
00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.560
Now, you start with a micro controller,
but you need other components around that.

64
00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.740
And each one of these components
has different parameters.

65
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.260
Different sizes for instance, different,
and you might care about that.

66
00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.060
You might need this whole design to
fit into a certain space, right?

67
00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.450
So you're worried about the size.

68
00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.910
Different voltage,
different electrical parameters right,

69
00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.040
how much current can this component take,
right?

70
00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.310
Maybe this LED can only take 20
milli amps, which is sort of common.

71
00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.726
So if you drive it with more than that,
you'll blow up the LED, things like this.

72
00:03:39.726 --> 00:03:44.682
So everyone of these components has these
features that you have to consider before

73
00:03:44.682 --> 00:03:45.685
you order them.

74
00:03:45.685 --> 00:03:48.244
Now back in the old days when I was a kid,

75
00:03:48.244 --> 00:03:52.511
when you wanted to do one of these
projects, you'd go to a store,

76
00:03:52.511 --> 00:03:58.045
Radio Shack which is gone now, you go to
RadioShack and you could buy the parts.

77
00:03:58.045 --> 00:04:00.795
And the people in the store
could help you with the parts.

78
00:04:00.795 --> 00:04:02.835
So they were knowledgeable
about these little parts.

79
00:04:02.835 --> 00:04:05.790
So they would say, oh that chip,
it will do this, but this component,

80
00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.110
this resistor is no good for
that purpose or something, right?

81
00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.630
They'd give you, they have knowledge
about the different components and

82
00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.880
what they did, but
those components don't cost a lot, right?

83
00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.720
Switches and things like that, they're
pretty cheap, so stores like Radio Shack,

84
00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:18.330
things like that,

85
00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:21.630
they don't particularly care about
selling those things anymore, frankly.

86
00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.280
I mean they sell them, But they don't
make a lot of money off of them,

87
00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.440
I get the feeling.

88
00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.610
They make money off of
selling cellphone deals, or

89
00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.930
something like this, something else.

90
00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.410
So you go into these stores and generally,

91
00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.690
the people are not knowledgeable about
their components, which means that it is

92
00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.200
on is on you to understand these
components of what they do.

93
00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.700
So you can't rely, most of the time,
unless you go to a good store and

94
00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.240
there are stores like that where you can
get somebody who really knows what he or

95
00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.520
she's talking about, but
often, you are on your own.

96
00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.790
And another thing too is that these
type of hobbiest electrical stores,

97
00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:55.510
they're rare, they are few and
far between these days.

98
00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.230
You can't find stores
that have these parts.

99
00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:01.090
I mean I go to Fry's, things like this,
also other local places, but

100
00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:02.500
it's hard to find these parts.

101
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.530
So often you're buying
these components online.

102
00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:07.140
You go online, you look at websites.

103
00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.960
Now these websites,
there are a lot of different websites and

104
00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.110
they're very complete,
they have tons of components.

105
00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:16.015
But in some ways, it's sort of data
overload, there are too many components,

106
00:05:16.015 --> 00:05:17.484
too many slight variations.

107
00:05:17.484 --> 00:05:20.029
So you see 100 components
that look similar and

108
00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:22.702
you have to figure out exactly
the one that you want.

109
00:05:22.702 --> 00:05:26.525
And I can't tell you how many times I
thought I wanted a component, I ordered

110
00:05:26.525 --> 00:05:30.370
the component, it comes a week later and
then tada, it is not what I needed.

111
00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:34.620
It is somehow slightly wrong and
now I have to go and order new parts and

112
00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.080
cycle through that.

113
00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.810
And it is inevitable that will happen to
some extent, so just be ready for that.

114
00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:43.450
But you really wanna minimize that, you
wanna to be able to know before you go and

115
00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:47.150
order these parts, you want to be able
to know that they match your needs,

116
00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:48.880
as well as you can know that.

117
00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.620
So that is what data sheets are for.

118
00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:56.110
So, data sheets are basically information
sheets about hardware components and

119
00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:58.420
every component has a data sheet.

120
00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:00.960
The simplest components,
maybe you don't have a data sheet.

121
00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:04.090
For instance, a resistor, actually even
resistors you can probably find data

122
00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:07.110
sheets, but a resistor is so simple you
don't need a datasheet for that, okay?

123
00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:09.818
They have very few parameters,
but any kind of complicated

124
00:06:09.818 --> 00:06:13.567
component will have a datasheet that tells
you all kinds of information about it.

125
00:06:13.567 --> 00:06:17.678
The size, the shape, the inputs, the
outputs, the voltage, all the electrical

126
00:06:17.678 --> 00:06:21.400
parameters, things like this all the data
that you need in order to use it.

127
00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.560
So reading these datasheets
is really important.

128
00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.324
You can always find data sheets online,
you find the part number, you type

129
00:06:28.324 --> 00:06:32.405
it into Google, the part number, type
data sheet and you will find data sheets.

130
00:06:32.405 --> 00:06:34.762
And they can be very complicated to read,
but

131
00:06:34.762 --> 00:06:37.687
it is important that you be
able to minimally read them.

132
00:06:37.687 --> 00:06:41.062
At least find the important information,
just so you can order the parts you're

133
00:06:41.062 --> 00:06:43.457
gonna need to make these devices
that you will be making.

134
00:06:43.457 --> 00:06:44.107
Thank you.

135
00:06:44.107 --> 00:06:52.849
