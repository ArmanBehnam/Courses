00:00:00.068 --> 00:00:09.494
[MUSIC].

2
00:00:09.494 --> 00:00:12.591
So, we'll continue to talk a little
bit more about datasheets for

3
00:00:12.591 --> 00:00:15.636
hardware components,
specifically for integrated circuits,

4
00:00:15.636 --> 00:00:17.590
because they are extra complicated.

5
00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.330
So right here we got, this is a rectifier,
a Schottky Rectifier.

6
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.540
This is a piece of a data sheet.

7
00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.606
So if you Google Schottky Rectifier and if
you type in the part number for that and

8
00:00:26.606 --> 00:00:30.066
type data sheet and Google that,
you'll come up with a data sheet,

9
00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:31.966
several versions of it, actually.

10
00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:33.064
And you can click on it and

11
00:00:33.064 --> 00:00:36.110
there are lots of different
things inside this data sheet.

12
00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.560
One thing that you always
find inside a data sheet

13
00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.680
is the physical dimensions of the part.

14
00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.450
Because they always want to tell you how
do you build it into a bigger system.

15
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.780
So, how's it going to
connect to everything.

16
00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:47.990
You always want to know that.

17
00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.900
This is actually a diagram
showing the physical dimensions.

18
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.490
It shows all detail, the size of it and
this is just one cross-section.

19
00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:00.530
A lot of time these data sheets will show
different views from different angles.

20
00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.230
This shows you with the pins.

21
00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.460
It shows you every dimension
that you need to know about.

22
00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.030
Actually, right there on that,
you can't see all the numbers there.

23
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.260
They label them with letters but

24
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.720
there is a table next to it
that shows what the sizes are.

25
00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.960
This is a typical thing you
will find inside a data sheet.

26
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.590
Now, you find tons of
information in a data sheet.

27
00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:24.160
And part of it, certainly when I started
I could not read most of a data sheet.

28
00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.090
All right,
you can read a little bit of a data sheet,

29
00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.730
so I don't expect people to be
able to read the whole data sheet.

30
00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.085
And, in fact, most of the data sheet,
you don't practically need.

31
00:01:33.085 --> 00:01:35.910
But, some key things you
should be able to figure out.

32
00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.690
For instance, the size, you typically
wanna be able to read the size cuz

33
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.170
there are certain things
that you need to know.

34
00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.780
Like, for instance for this class,
say you want to use a bread board, right?

35
00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.070
That's commonly what we want to use for
prototyping is a bread board for

36
00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.060
connecting things.

37
00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.602
For that,
you need to know the size of the pins and

38
00:01:52.602 --> 00:01:56.453
its spacing between the pins because
the holes in a bread board is spaced at

39
00:01:56.453 --> 00:01:58.524
one tenth of an inch between each hole.

40
00:01:58.524 --> 00:02:01.954
So, when you get a component, you wanna
know the pins are spaced some multiple of

41
00:02:01.954 --> 00:02:03.978
that, so
you can fit them into the bread board.

42
00:02:03.978 --> 00:02:04.825
Things like this.

43
00:02:04.825 --> 00:02:07.691
And, if they're not, you need to know
that before you order the part, so

44
00:02:07.691 --> 00:02:09.183
that you can do something about that.

45
00:02:09.183 --> 00:02:11.298
So, the physical side,
the physical dimensions,

46
00:02:11.298 --> 00:02:15.500
you always find that in the data sheet,
and you'll need to be able to read that.

47
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.040
Now other information,

48
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.230
just a sample of some of the other
information in the data sheet.

49
00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.550
You find electrical parameters and

50
00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.970
thermal parameters,
what temperature can this thing run at.

51
00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.900
Now usually, thermal parameters
are not something I generally need,

52
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.180
because I'm not trying to use these
components in some extreme environment,

53
00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.470
but they give some kind of boundaries.

54
00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.340
It can't be hotter than this,
colder than this.

55
00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:38.720
That's generally not useful to me,

56
00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.720
but maybe you're using some application
where you need that information.

57
00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.910
Electrical parameters are important
to tell you things like

58
00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.640
what's the maximum and minimum voltage,
maximum current that can go through that.

59
00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.230
And that is actually important because
you wanna make sure, for instance,

60
00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.270
that components are voltage-compatible.

61
00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.150
So for instance,
say you get a microcontroller and

62
00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.200
it's outputting at 5 volts, but
you get a component that only needs,

63
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.700
only accepts up to 3.3 volts,
which is by the way, a common mismatch.

64
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.940
So if that happens,
you need to know that so

65
00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.280
you can either buy the component that
matches your microcontroller, 5 volts, or

66
00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.740
you can do some type of stepping, voltage
stepping, put a transformer in between,

67
00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.200
something like that to change
the voltages and make them match.

68
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.260
So, these parameters,
some of these parameters you need,

69
00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.160
some of them you don't need that much.

70
00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.880
Now, integrated circuits
are another type of component.

71
00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.530
They're a sort of simple components and
more complicated components, and

72
00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.020
the data sheets vary in complexity.

73
00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:36.930
So if you look at a simple
component like a resistor,

74
00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.890
and we'll talk more about those later,
but they're very simple.

75
00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.292
You don't need a data sheet for
a resistor or a capacitor.

76
00:03:42.292 --> 00:03:44.947
You need minimal Information
about those components.

77
00:03:44.947 --> 00:03:48.202
But more complicated components,
the more complicated they are,

78
00:03:48.202 --> 00:03:49.980
the denser the datasheet is.

79
00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.300
Integrated circuits are basically
the extreme of that.

80
00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:53.735
So, integrated circuits,

81
00:03:53.735 --> 00:03:57.579
and we've talked about these
microcontrollers are integrated circuits.

82
00:03:57.579 --> 00:03:59.436
Integrated circuits are chips.

83
00:03:59.436 --> 00:04:04.170
Now, they're typically made
of say silicon, silicon base.

84
00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.150
But they can be made of other materials,
primarily silicon right now.

85
00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.150
And we're not gonna talk about
the fabrication technology except to say

86
00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.860
that they're basically made on these
big wafers so you can see down there.

87
00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:20.690
You can see these disks,
these flat disks, these circular disks.

88
00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.540
So those disks are slices of silicon, and

89
00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:28.930
you chop them up into little rectangles
and each rectangle is a chip.

90
00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:30.070
As you take that chip and

91
00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.420
you package it as you can see over there
on the right, you see the packaging.

92
00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.560
You hide it inside this bigger package,
and

93
00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:42.080
the package is used to protect the chip,
also to cool the chip as it's running.

94
00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.420
Also to wire its pins.

95
00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:46.490
You can see the pins on the bottom.

96
00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:51.240
So the pins on a chip are too tiny to
contact, so you need them to be bigger,

97
00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.350
so the package does that for you.

98
00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:56.640
So the package provides pins that you can
actually make contact with and big enough

99
00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:01.810
for you to solder into or connect into
a bread board or something like that.

100
00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.500
So anyway, these integrated circuits,

101
00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.840
they have data sheets as well,
chip is protected by the package.

102
00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.190
These integrated circuits have data
sheets as well, and these data sheets for

103
00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:13.490
integrated circuits can be very
complicated because what these

104
00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:16.700
integrated circuits do can widely vary.

105
00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:20.430
So an integrated circuit for instance
can be an entire processor, right?

106
00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.875
And then the data sheet for
that can be heck, over a thousand pages.

107
00:05:23.875 --> 00:05:24.510
[LAUGH] All right.

108
00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:26.510
I've definitely seen that.

109
00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:28.290
Or a simpler process is
like a microcontroller.

110
00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:30.690
Maybe you get 150 page data sheet, right?

111
00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:34.520
And it's got tons of information
on how this device behaves.

112
00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:39.090
Now, most of the time for this class we
won't have to go to that level of detail.

113
00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:41.706
We won't have to look at
the 150 page data sheet, and

114
00:05:41.706 --> 00:05:43.609
look at the details of what's going on.

115
00:05:43.609 --> 00:05:48.010
In fact, with the components that
we're using, we're using Arduinos and

116
00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:48.983
Raspberry Pis.

117
00:05:48.983 --> 00:05:54.890
Those boards, they come with libraries
that hide the details for us, okay.

118
00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:57.910
So we will not have to be exploring

119
00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:01.850
a lot of the details inside
those components, thankfully.

120
00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:03.520
But, you could.

121
00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:07.241
So if you really want to make the most
use of these components, these chips,

122
00:06:07.241 --> 00:06:09.930
you can look in the data sheet and
see lots of features.

123
00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.605
So the trade off with what we're
doing with our Arduinos and

124
00:06:12.605 --> 00:06:15.655
our Raspberry Pis is that they give
us these library functions, and

125
00:06:15.655 --> 00:06:20.050
we'll talk about these later, that
simplify things for us as programmers.

126
00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:23.110
But they hide details,
they also hide features.

127
00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:26.880
So there are a lot of things that
you can't do with a processor,

128
00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.540
with a microcontroller,

129
00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:31.450
just because the library doesn't
allow you access to that feature.

130
00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:33.880
Now, if you want access to
that feature you can go and

131
00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.780
look at the data sheet and do it, but
you won't be able to rely on the nice,

132
00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:40.420
easy library functions that
you really want to rely on.

133
00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:44.178
And inside this class, we probably won't
be going into that level of detail about

134
00:06:44.178 --> 00:06:45.707
these microcontrollers at all.

135
00:06:45.707 --> 00:06:50.136
We'll just use their library functions and
not have to worry about these extreme

136
00:06:50.136 --> 00:06:53.080
details of the behavior of
these microcontrollers.

137
00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:59.714
Thank you.
