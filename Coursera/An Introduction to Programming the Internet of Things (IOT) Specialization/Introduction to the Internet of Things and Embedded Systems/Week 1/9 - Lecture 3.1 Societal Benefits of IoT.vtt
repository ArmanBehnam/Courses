2
00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:16.276
Let's talk a little bit about
the benefits to society that Internet

3
00:00:16.276 --> 00:00:17.756
of Things can have.

4
00:00:17.756 --> 00:00:21.946
And that's why we do these things,
right, presumably is to benefit society,

5
00:00:21.946 --> 00:00:23.660
to help people.

6
00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.320
So, we'll talk a little bit about that.

7
00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.440
So, generally, these IoT devices,

8
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:34.590
the use of Internet of Things technology
makes life easier, that's the goal.

9
00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.520
In lots of different ways
depending on the device, but

10
00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.990
it's supposed to make life easier.

11
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.520
So for instance,

12
00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.370
some lectures ago we talked about
an Internet refrigerator, right?

13
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.250
An Internet refrigerator
that was intelligent,

14
00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.020
could order your food for you.

15
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.870
It takes care of things you don't
necessarily want to take care of, right?

16
00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:56.320
It takes care of these details that you
would have had to spend time on, but

17
00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.130
now you don't, right?

18
00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:59.660
It says okay, you need this food,
I will order this food.

19
00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.651
And I don't have to worry, necessarily,
about doing that ordering, right,

20
00:01:03.651 --> 00:01:06.000
because I'm busy,
I have more important things to do.

21
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.150
So, it's supposed to make things easy for
you.

22
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:09.920
Are my accounts balanced?

23
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.623
Let's say I have my phone device,
I'm using it to do my banking,

24
00:01:14.623 --> 00:01:17.378
right, and it balances my accounts.

25
00:01:17.378 --> 00:01:21.170
It says oh, you owe this much,
I will simply transfer the money, right?

26
00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.230
So that was a details where maybe I don't
want to deal with those details, right?

27
00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.860
I want to do something fun with my life,
but I have to balance my accounts and

28
00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:28.950
pay my bills.

29
00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.650
But my device can deal with that for

30
00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.830
me rather than me having to think about
it consciously all the time, right?

31
00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.458
So, that's generally the goal
of IoT is to just enhance these

32
00:01:39.458 --> 00:01:41.687
devices to make them better.

33
00:01:41.687 --> 00:01:42.552
And the key thing,

34
00:01:42.552 --> 00:01:46.390
key aspect of that is to make them
better without adding complexity.

35
00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.060
So, you don't wanna have to, sure,

36
00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.840
say I would like to have a refrigerator
that can order my food for me, right?

37
00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.680
But I don't want to have to
write code to get it to do that.

38
00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.630
I want it to be easy, almost as
easy as a regular refrigerator, but

39
00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.440
still do these nice things for me.

40
00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.050
So, you enhance the features
of some devices

41
00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.850
to make them do things that
are very helpful to you.

42
00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.020
But, you don't want to enhance the
features in such a way that it increases

43
00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.930
complexity.

44
00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.708
So the complexity is dealt with by
the computational infrastructure inside

45
00:02:15.708 --> 00:02:16.361
the device.

46
00:02:19.984 --> 00:02:24.468
IoT can also help you be
independent of people, right.

47
00:02:24.468 --> 00:02:29.850
So you don't need to have as many people
as you used to have to do certain things.

48
00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.630
So this is good and this is bad, right.

49
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.460
So, certain things that you
would have had humans deal with,

50
00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.660
now your IoT device can deal with for you.

51
00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.340
So, for instance,
fewer doctor visits, right.

52
00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.020
If I had my health monitor on my wrist, I
don't have to necessarily go to the doctor

53
00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.254
to have the doctor tell me oh,
your blood sugar level is fine, right?

54
00:02:48.254 --> 00:02:50.880
Or, your heart rate is fine,
everything is going well.

55
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.620
My device can see that and report back to
me and say yes, everything is fine, and

56
00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.130
I don't need to see the doctor as much.

57
00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.002
Now, there's still always a need for
a doctor, but

58
00:03:00.002 --> 00:03:02.687
maybe just when something
calamitous happens.

59
00:03:02.687 --> 00:03:06.130
Maybe on a regular basis,
I don't need to see the doctor as much.

60
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:07.310
So, going to the super market.

61
00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.320
I don't have to go the supermarket if my
fridge is buying my food for me, right?

62
00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.200
And ordering it on Amazon Fresh,
or something like that.

63
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.480
I don't have to deal
with that nearly as much.

64
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.450
So I don't have to actually interact
with people as much as a I had to.

65
00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:21.690
Now, interactions can be good.

66
00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.372
But also, depending on people for
things can be burdensome.

67
00:03:25.372 --> 00:03:30.590
So maybe if you have a bunch
of Internet of things,

68
00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.600
IoT devices that are helping you, you can
depend a little bit less on people, and

69
00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.660
take care of things independently.

70
00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.910
And actually, this is very helpful for
people who are infirm, or

71
00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:47.000
maybe you're older, you're infirm and
you don't wanna have to depend on people.

72
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.630
You wanna be able to live independently.

73
00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.410
IoT devices can help you a lot.

74
00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.700
So for instance, cars that are coming
online that drive themselves, right?

75
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.720
Ultimate IoT device,
drives you to where you wanna go.

76
00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.640
That can be really helpful if
you're old enough where you can't,

77
00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.840
maybe you lose your license cuz your
vision is bad, or something like this.

78
00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.300
Your reaction time is slow.

79
00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.870
If you have a car that can drive itself,
drive to wherever you wanna go,

80
00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.760
that's a pretty big advantage, right?

81
00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.560
So not having to depend on a person,
to hire a person to do that,

82
00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:21.436
you can just have your IoT device do
that for, could be very helpful to you.

83
00:04:21.436 --> 00:04:25.380
Also, IoT devices,
they got Internet right there in the term,

84
00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.840
they connect into the network, so
you can actually connect to people.

85
00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:30.540
So in some ways,

86
00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.990
it can enhance your interaction
with people in a different form.

87
00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.900
So maybe not in person interaction, but

88
00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.390
you can talk to people on the network,
right.

89
00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:43.350
Through any device that you
feel like using, right.

90
00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.860
So you can have all sorts of
personal interactions, but

91
00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.700
also professional interactions.

92
00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.547
So you can do,
we get this a lot at work now.

93
00:04:51.547 --> 00:04:53.373
Rather than going all
the way to a conference and

94
00:04:53.373 --> 00:04:55.570
spending money to fly out there,
stay at a hotel.

95
00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:59.465
We can have meetings online and
I don't have to move anywhere.

96
00:04:59.465 --> 00:05:01.995
I can just use the camera in front of me.

97
00:05:01.995 --> 00:05:05.695
I can use my phone, and
just do a conference right there, right.

98
00:05:05.695 --> 00:05:09.646
So its a lot cheaper, and it's not
the same as in person interaction, but

99
00:05:09.646 --> 00:05:12.087
it can save you a lot of
money in the long term.

100
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.094
Thank you.

101
00:05:15.094 --> 00:05:21.489
