2
00:00:10.782 --> 00:00:14.955
This lecture will compare IoT
devices to standard computers, and

3
00:00:14.955 --> 00:00:17.197
it will just compare and contrast.

4
00:00:17.197 --> 00:00:20.516
Just so you get an idea of the difference
between an IoT device and a computer,

5
00:00:20.516 --> 00:00:22.610
because they are substantially different.

6
00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:24.300
And we'll need to know this for

7
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.140
later because we're gonna talk
about how you design IoT devices.

8
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.159
And the design methodologies are very
different than what you'd use for

9
00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:32.806
a standard general purpose computer.

10
00:00:35.587 --> 00:00:40.619
So, IoT devices, one big difference
between those type of devices in standard

11
00:00:40.619 --> 00:00:45.500
computers, and by standard computer
I mean desktop, laptop, server.

12
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.600
Basically a big box with a keyboard,
big box or

13
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.052
little box, with a keyboard and
a screen, mouse, that type of thing.

14
00:00:53.052 --> 00:00:56.430
So one difference is that IoT devices,

15
00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.060
the main function of an IoT
device is not to compute.

16
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.390
Not to be a computer.

17
00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.840
A computer is there to be a computer,
to compute functions, to run programs.

18
00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.290
But an IoT device,
that is not its main point.

19
00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.090
It has some other function besides that.

20
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.650
So, for instance,
we talked about cars last lecture, right?

21
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.450
So cars, their IoT devices,
their main function is not to

22
00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.250
compute anti-lock breaking or
to do fuel injection,

23
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.840
their main function from the point
of view of a user is to be driven.

24
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.920
Right?
To move you from place to place.

25
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.670
And the computer is just to help
that function, just to support that.

26
00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.250
Also, we talked about refrigerators,
right?

27
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.610
In an earlier lecture.

28
00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.030
So, a refrigerator, it's a refrigerator,
it keeps things cold,

29
00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.470
that's its main function.

30
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.010
Now, computational intelligence can
help you, network connectivity can

31
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.090
improve its ability, but that is not its
main function, to talk on the network.

32
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.220
Its main function's not to run code,
even though it does that,

33
00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:56.460
where a computer,
it's main function is to run code.

34
00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.932
So that's a big difference,
that's the focus of the function.

35
00:01:59.932 --> 00:02:03.350
That IOT have this separate function,
separate from computation.

36
00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.710
So computers, like I said,
their main function is to compute.

37
00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:10.600
They run code.

38
00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.840
This code can do lots of different things,
but they execute code.

39
00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.570
This picture right here,
we're showing a decision making process.

40
00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.070
It's sort of a high level view of
what PC code would look like, but

41
00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:22.420
there'd be conditions in there.

42
00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.780
If X is greater than five,
then perform this action.

43
00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.940
If X is less than five,
then do another action.

44
00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.030
Something like that.

45
00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.450
That's what code looks like, and
that's the point of a compute,r is to

46
00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.280
execute code, execute a sequence
of functions in a particular order

47
00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.860
as determined by dynamic information,
like that condition right there.

48
00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.370
That condition might check
something dynamically at runtime.

49
00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.850
And we'll get into more detail of this,
because we will be coding in this class.

50
00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.330
But right now,

51
00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.100
the function of the computer's main
point is to run code like this.

52
00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.370
IoT devices,
on the other hand, they don't.

53
00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.810
So computers are made to
be general purpose, right.

54
00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.250
They're made to run any kind of code.

55
00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.690
So if you buy, off the shelf,
you buy some Intel processor.

56
00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:06.540
I see a Mac in front of me.

57
00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:07.880
Say I buy a MAC.

58
00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.700
This Mac is a laptop.

59
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.340
This Mac laptop is meant to run code and
it can run any kind of code.

60
00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.310
I can play a video game on that thing.

61
00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.630
I can connect it up to a camera and
video record something.

62
00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.060
I can do, whatever kind of code I want
to run on that computer, I can do that.

63
00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.219
So computers are made to
be general purpose devices.

64
00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.590
Now, they're not particularly good or

65
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.840
efficient at a particular application, but
they are generally good at everything.

66
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:40.120
So what that means is say,
this one I see right here, this Mac.

67
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.420
This Mac is now connected to this camera,
and I'm assuming that this Mac is probably

68
00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.920
running the PowerPoint slides
[LAUGH] that I'm presenting,

69
00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.630
and it is probably recording some, right?

70
00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:54.100
So sure, you can use a Mac to
record video if you want to.

71
00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.520
You can connect it up to a camera,
record a video, record a sequence,

72
00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.830
but a dedicated camera is better
than a Mac at doing that.

73
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:03.650
Right?
I can take a Mac and

74
00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.690
connect it up to a webcam, and
it's now a video recorder.

75
00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.880
But it's probably gonna be better,
more efficient to get a camera,

76
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.970
a video camera that is made for
that purpose to do that task.

77
00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.240
So computers are general purpose,
they can do whatever you want.

78
00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.210
You hook something onto them,
they can do what you want.

79
00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:21.090
But they are not necessarily
the most efficient and

80
00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.160
most effective tool at doing that.

81
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.010
So Internet of Things devices
are generally special-purpose things.

82
00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.650
So they are made to do
a particular task or

83
00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.450
set of tasks that are all
related to one thing.

84
00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.345
So as an example, music player, right?

85
00:04:39.345 --> 00:04:42.805
So I still own one of these,
an mp3 player, cuz I'm cheap.

86
00:04:42.805 --> 00:04:44.045
You can buy them cheap.

87
00:04:44.045 --> 00:04:47.405
You can do it off a phone, too, but
I use a special purpose device, you know,

88
00:04:47.405 --> 00:04:48.855
like an iPod, right?

89
00:04:48.855 --> 00:04:51.575
So these devices are made to play music.

90
00:04:51.575 --> 00:04:54.105
Now, you can play music off of a laptop,
right?

91
00:04:54.105 --> 00:04:55.295
Desktop, whatever.

92
00:04:55.295 --> 00:04:58.873
But this device is made for music playing,
and so it's more efficient.

93
00:04:58.873 --> 00:05:02.000
And by mor efficient,
I mean Its hardware and

94
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.360
its software are designed just for
that purpose.

95
00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.470
So if that's all you wanna do.

96
00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.250
They play music very well.

97
00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:10.340
They're cheap, right?

98
00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:11.550
They don't cost much, right?

99
00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.300
You don't have to buy a whole laptop for
that.

100
00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.350
You can just buy a little iPod,
little tiny one, right?

101
00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:18.310
They have the little iPods,
the randomization, the shuffle,

102
00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:19.780
iPod shuffle, right?

103
00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:20.700
Tiny, cheap.

104
00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.180
Very compact,
much smaller than a laptop, right?

105
00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.810
But they do their job, so
that specific job, they do great.

106
00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:34.630
So these IoT devises are almost
always special purpose devices.

107
00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:36.010
Take a car, right?

108
00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:39.040
Now a car,
a car will do many different things, but

109
00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.730
they're all related to driving.

110
00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:42.760
So a car can do anti-lock braking.

111
00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.480
A car can do fuel injection.

112
00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:49.430
A car can do power steering,
all these things, but

113
00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:52.660
they're all parts of one big task,
to drive.

114
00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:53.991
To be driven, right?

115
00:05:53.991 --> 00:05:58.380
So that's why I say a car
does computation but

116
00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:03.410
only computation that are related
to the task that are driving tasks.

117
00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:06.850
So what that means is the hardware and
the software built in there.

118
00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:09.010
Are streamlined for that purpose.

119
00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:10.540
So that means they can be cheaper.

120
00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:13.490
Cheaper effect,
more efficient in that way.

121
00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:16.690
Cheaper and
faster at doing just that one task.

122
00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:18.930
Now they wouldn't be suitable
to do anything else, right?

123
00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:20.060
So if you took your car and said look,

124
00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:23.530
I wanna play a video game with my car,
you probably can't do that as well.

125
00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:24.340
But if you wanna say,

126
00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:27.250
look I wanna do fuel injection with
my car, hey it's perfect for that.

127
00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:29.890
And it's great at that and
efficient at that.

128
00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:33.901
So That's a big difference between IoT
devices and general purpose computers.

129
00:06:33.901 --> 00:06:35.393
IoT device is a special purpose.

130
00:06:35.393 --> 00:06:38.419
They do a particular thing.

131
00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:47.559
Thank you.
