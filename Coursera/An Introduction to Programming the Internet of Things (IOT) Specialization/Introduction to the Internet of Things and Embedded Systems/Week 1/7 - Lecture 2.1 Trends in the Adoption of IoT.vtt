2
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.220
This lecture we'll talk about
the various trend [INAUDIBLE].

3
00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:17.950
Technological trends that have led to
the incident of things, say revolution.

4
00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.680
It's a overused word, but
let's try to use that right now.

5
00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.267
So there are lots of different
trends that have led to this,

6
00:00:23.267 --> 00:00:27.270
led to the incorporation of things,
technology into devices today.

7
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:28.590
And so we'll talk about those things.

8
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.580
And it sort of crept up
on us over the years,

9
00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.970
but now there's this convergence
where the situation is right.

10
00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:35.161
Everything works and

11
00:00:35.161 --> 00:00:39.337
you can really do a lot of the things
that you see in these IoT devices today.

12
00:00:42.286 --> 00:00:45.300
So there are several trends.

13
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.470
One trend is cost,
is the straight cost of devices,

14
00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.490
so things have gotten a lot cheaper.

15
00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.310
Computational technology has gotten
a lot cheaper than it used to be.

16
00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.470
Now, these are extremes, but take ENIAC.

17
00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.440
Early machine, 1945, very early.

18
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.070
Not the earliest, but very early machine.

19
00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.820
At the time, it cost almost half a million
dollars which in today's dollars is a lot

20
00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.780
more than that, at the time.

21
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.670
So that was expensive, very expensive for
the cheapest available machine.

22
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.051
Now you can get a laptop for $500.

23
00:01:14.051 --> 00:01:17.260
You can get one cheaper than that,
you can get one more expensive, but

24
00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.180
you can get a very capable laptop for
$500.

25
00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.530
So things have gotten a lot
cheaper over the years.

26
00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.850
And by the way, I'm saying you can
get a laptop for $500, an IoT device.

27
00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.650
The computational ability of
it is a lot less than laptops.

28
00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.620
So it will be a lot cheaper than $500.

29
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.200
But the point is that over time
computational technology has

30
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.460
gotten a lot cheaper.

31
00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.130
And so it's within the reach of what
you could add on to a lot of different

32
00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.840
devices.

33
00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.640
So you wouldn't have wanted to
take your standard car in 1945 and

34
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.090
add an ENIAC to it because it would
add $500,000 worth of cost, right?

35
00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.920
But now you can add on
some low cost device and

36
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.390
get the benefits of computational
technology without too much cost.

37
00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.400
So this is a picture of ENIAC,
the original.

38
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.900
It is big.

39
00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:01.620
Big and expensive.

40
00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.310
So this is another thing that's changed.

41
00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:04.410
It also has a lot of wires.

42
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.170
If you look at it,
the way they programmed it was with wires.

43
00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.810
A lot of wiring going on in there.

44
00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:09.990
Manual wiring.

45
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.200
So this is a picture of it and it was big.

46
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.690
So that's another trend.

47
00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:14.910
Hardware size.

48
00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.998
Things have become smaller.

49
00:02:16.998 --> 00:02:20.360
Now that old ENIAC there was no possible
way you were going be able to get that

50
00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.150
thing and fit it into a device,
into a thing.

51
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.270
So that old ENIAC was, say approximately,
1,800 square feet, 27 tons.

52
00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.230
It was a big thing.

53
00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.040
But a laptop today is small,
small and light.

54
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.850
And IoT devices are smaller and
lighter than that, so think,

55
00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.450
computational technology has
also shrunk and gotten lighter,

56
00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.570
to the point that it can be incorporated
in lots of different devices.

57
00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.580
So this is just a size comparison.

58
00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.450
See, so we've got ENIAC over there,
different lighting but

59
00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.750
basically the same machine,
and then we've got a laptop.

60
00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.180
And you can see how the computational
technology has just vastly shrunk to

61
00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.739
the point where you can actually
incorporate it into devices.

62
00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.940
Now, another big trend that helps
make IoT possible is the fact

63
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.540
that computational ability has
grown dramatically since, say, 45.

64
00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.430
So in 45, that ENIAC that you saw,

65
00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.970
that got approximately 5,000
instructions per second.

66
00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.020
Now, a standard laptop 18 billion,
now this is plus or

67
00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.470
minus, right, but 18 billion easy.

68
00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.000
That's a dramatic improvement,
and what that buys you,

69
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.590
what that gives you is a fact that you
can implement a lot more features.

70
00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.213
There are many things that you couldn't
have dreamed of being able to do back

71
00:03:40.213 --> 00:03:44.160
in '45 with a computer that you
can now handle because you have so

72
00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.800
many more computations to
play with in a unit of time.

73
00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.300
So, for instance, speech to text, right?

74
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.330
That's common in phones today, right?

75
00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.010
Where you talk and
it interprets your speech.

76
00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.160
There's no way with 5,000 instructions
per second you could do that in

77
00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.200
anywhere near real time.

78
00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:03.680
Audio processing, network communication
all these things that you can do now

79
00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.030
that require lots of computation and
it just wasn't possible with old machines.

80
00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.770
So with modern machines there is so
much computational ability,

81
00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:13.840
their clock rates are so
fast and there is parallelism.

82
00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.370
These things are multi-course,
you got multiple processes in one device.

83
00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.940
There is so
much computation ability you can.

84
00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.290
You can do so many more things
that were thought of back then and

85
00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.150
couldn't have dreamed of back then, but
now, we see there's so much you can do.

86
00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.090
So, it makes it more practical
using devices today to implement

87
00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:32.620
the features we're
interested in implementing.

88
00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.948
Another trend is Internet access.

89
00:04:36.948 --> 00:04:40.240
So, in '45 the Internet didn't exist.

90
00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.550
Networking wasn't there, but
Internet access has improved.

91
00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.430
So, the Internet is reachable
from a lot of places.

92
00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:49.490
First, it exists.

93
00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.550
Right?
It didn't used to exist.

94
00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.370
But now it's also true that
in lots of different places,

95
00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.290
almost everywhere, you can access
the Internet through some mechanism.

96
00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:02.000
Now this depends on what country you're
in and how much money your country has.

97
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.300
Some parts of the world poor parts
of the world have less access.

98
00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.440
We're in the US you have
pretty good access.

99
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.360
Wherever you wanna be you can
access it directly through wi-fi,

100
00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.620
you can access it through jacks in
the wall I mean we have ethernet jacks in

101
00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.410
the wall right here you can do it
wirelessly you can do it everywhere.

102
00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.840
Now different parts of
the world have less access,

103
00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:27.540
if you just look at this map, you can
see the lighter parts are less access.

104
00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:31.940
Most of Africa, a lot of Africa has less
access is just because they're out of

105
00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:36.380
reach of many different, a lot of
the infrastructure that's necessary.

106
00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.180
But there are some place like India,
that actually lower,

107
00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.690
in fact, I question this map.

108
00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:45.240
I don't thing it's as bad as
what's being stated on here, but

109
00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.910
it is generally true that there are parts
of the country, poor parts of the world

110
00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:53.360
rather, where Internet
access is harder to find.

111
00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:58.520
But generally it's greatly
improved over time.

112
00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.410
Also the fact that you can do
Internet access wirelessly.

113
00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:06.980
That actually helps a whole lot
because running cables is expensive.

114
00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:10.270
Where putting up a wireless
router is much less expensive.

115
00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:13.550
Putting up a cell tower that
costs a certain amount of money,

116
00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:16.730
but given the expanse that it covers

117
00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:20.730
It's much more cost efficient than having
to run wires into everybody's home.

118
00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:25.021
So wireless access is one of those
things that's ubiquitous now, and

119
00:06:25.021 --> 00:06:29.035
it makes IoT technology much more
usable and much more possible.

120
00:06:32.913 --> 00:06:33.970
Data costs.

121
00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:36.600
So the cost of Internet
access is fairly low.

122
00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.900
Now this definitely varies
depending on where you are.

123
00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:42.050
It's never low enough for me.

124
00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:45.960
I don't like how much I have to pay
every month on my cell phone bill or for

125
00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.220
my cable bill, stuff like that.

126
00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:51.910
But it's low enough that a lot
of people can afford it.

127
00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:55.850
In poor countries, this is not necessarily
the case, but that's changing.

128
00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:59.240
Bandwidth is high.

129
00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:03.830
So what this means is that you
can transmit lots of data fast.

130
00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:07.960
And that actually enables
a lot of different features.

131
00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.570
So streaming movies for instance, right?

132
00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:13.750
If you want to stream video,
you need a lot of bandwidth, right?

133
00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:15.000
As opposed to just sending data.

134
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.350
If you want to send email,
you don't need a lot of bandwidth.

135
00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:20.480
Email has a certain amount of text and
it doesn't take much data to transmit.

136
00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.780
But if you want to support video,

137
00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:26.160
you need pretty good bandwidth
to support it in real time.

138
00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:29.620
To send the frames, lots of pixels,
it takes you a lot of bandwidth.

139
00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:32.330
But bandwidth is available
in a lot of places.

140
00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:33.390
And wirelessly too.

141
00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:35.090
So you can, through wi-fi or

142
00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:39.100
some other type of wireless technology,
cell phones, you can actually get enough

143
00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:41.910
bandwidth to be able to see
videos through that technology.

144
00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:46.718
So the bandwidth actually has enabled a
lot of different features in IoT devices.

145
00:07:46.718 --> 00:07:48.336
Thank you.

146
00:07:48.336 --> 00:07:57.309
