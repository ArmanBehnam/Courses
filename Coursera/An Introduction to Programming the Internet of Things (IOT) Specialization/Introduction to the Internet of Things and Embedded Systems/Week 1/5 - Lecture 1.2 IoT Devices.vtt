2
00:00:09.923 --> 00:00:13.391
This lecture will give some more examples
of the Internet of things devices.

3
00:00:13.391 --> 00:00:17.555
Just to give you a sort of a better
more concrete idea of what these devices

4
00:00:17.555 --> 00:00:22.490
are and how they differ or how they're
distinct from traditional computers.

5
00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:24.890
So we'll run through
a few more examples and

6
00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:26.900
get a little more detail
about their behaviors.

7
00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:35.240
So take a car,
a car is an IoT device, I will claim.

8
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.870
Okay, the reason I call it this is,

9
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.420
because if you look at a car,
Ii's a thing, clearly.

10
00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.830
You look at a car, an old car,
there's an old car, a 50s car maybe.

11
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.077
So old cars had a certain interface,
right?

12
00:00:46.077 --> 00:00:50.606
You drive, you have a steering wheel,
gas pedal, brakes, and so on, the radio,

13
00:00:50.606 --> 00:00:53.970
sort of a simple,
straightforward interface.

14
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.030
What I would consider to be simple.

15
00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.340
Now that interface, it was basically
implemented with electrical and

16
00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.690
mechanical controls, but there was no
computational intelligence in there.

17
00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.750
Early cars, they didn't have computers
in there, processors doing anything.

18
00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.590
There was electricity,
there's mechanical stuff, but that was it.

19
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:18.528
So that was an original device,
it's not IoT, from the 50's.

20
00:01:18.528 --> 00:01:22.790
But nowadays cars have lots of
computational intelligence.

21
00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:23.560
Let's take a look at this.

22
00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.030
So, 21st century car.

23
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.900
So what is that?

24
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.808
Looks like a Prius I think.

25
00:01:28.808 --> 00:01:33.190
This car, its got lots of chips in it,
so lots of processors.

26
00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.509
That car might have over 50 processors
in it doing different tasks.

27
00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.698
For instance its got an anti-lock braking
system they all do these days and

28
00:01:41.698 --> 00:01:43.498
the anti-lock breaking system,

29
00:01:43.498 --> 00:01:47.172
it'll have its own processor
dedicated just to anti-lock braking.

30
00:01:47.172 --> 00:01:48.351
And so, its got that.

31
00:01:48.351 --> 00:01:50.179
Its got fuel injection, right?

32
00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:54.540
Fuel injection system, its gonna have
another processor dedicated to that.

33
00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.710
So every sub system has its own processor.

34
00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.240
And it's also got a stereo, say.

35
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.390
Stereo system's got to have
it's own processor, but

36
00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.330
every subsystem inside the car
has it's own processor.

37
00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.790
But the thing about this car that
you notice about this device,

38
00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:11.950
is that even though it has this
computational intelligence,

39
00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.580
it has the same basic
interface as that 50s car.

40
00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.393
So you drive this car
pretty much the same way.

41
00:02:18.393 --> 00:02:22.618
Now the 50s car, it probably had
manual transmission, I'm gonna guess,

42
00:02:22.618 --> 00:02:24.050
because it's the 50s.

43
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:25.485
So this will have automatic transmission.

44
00:02:25.485 --> 00:02:30.274
But besides that, it has the same
interface, the same steering wheel,

45
00:02:30.274 --> 00:02:32.090
gas pedal, brake.

46
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.970
So you could train somebody to drive on
the 50s car and they could drive this new

47
00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:41.380
car, even though this new car is enhanced
with all this computational intelligence.

48
00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.526
So, that's the thing about IoT devices,
they have a very simple interface.

49
00:02:46.526 --> 00:02:50.183
They want to be easy to use, they want to
give you the benefit of this computational

50
00:02:50.183 --> 00:02:53.213
intelligence, so now you have
anti-lock breaking for instance.

51
00:02:53.213 --> 00:02:55.974
And anti-lock breaking
in case you don't know,

52
00:02:55.974 --> 00:02:59.458
anti-lock breaking,
it prevents the tires from locking, so

53
00:02:59.458 --> 00:03:02.960
you don't want the tires to skid
compared to the road, right?

54
00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.540
They should always stay in
good contact with the road.

55
00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.220
But if you brake hard,
if you"re moving fast,

56
00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:12.150
you brake hard, the car will skid and the
tires will not move but the car will move.

57
00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.118
So anti-lock braking
tries to prevent that.

58
00:03:14.118 --> 00:03:15.830
Now, before anti-lock braking,

59
00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.680
what you used to do, I remember when
I learned how to drive on snow.

60
00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.130
You skid a lot, right?

61
00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.820
So what you do, is when you do a hard
break, you'll pump the breaks, right?

62
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.455
Manually pump the breaks.

63
00:03:26.455 --> 00:03:27.940
And you'd have to remember this,

64
00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.185
you'd have to be pretty consciously
aware enough to remember to do this.

65
00:03:31.185 --> 00:03:33.215
Anti-lock breakings do that for
you, right?

66
00:03:33.215 --> 00:03:35.780
Excellent breaking devices,
they take care of that for you.

67
00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.295
So this is a great benefit
to drivers nowadays.

68
00:03:39.295 --> 00:03:41.620
Kids they don't even know
about pumping breaks.

69
00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.085
They don't learn that
because they don't have to,

70
00:03:43.085 --> 00:03:45.130
anti-lock breaking takes care of it.

71
00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.713
So the computational
intelligence is helping you,

72
00:03:47.713 --> 00:03:50.951
reliving you of burdens that you
didn't wanna have to deal with.

73
00:03:50.951 --> 00:03:52.624
But the interface is beautiful.

74
00:03:52.624 --> 00:03:55.630
You don't have to worry, you just hit
brake pedal just like you used to.

75
00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:56.811
It just does better.

76
00:03:56.811 --> 00:03:58.856
It just does what you want it to do,
does better and

77
00:03:58.856 --> 00:04:01.220
makes everything easier for you.

78
00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.830
Now, a typical car like this car
that we're looking at right here.

79
00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:10.400
This car, it has computational
intelligence, now whether or

80
00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.470
not it has networking
is a different thing.

81
00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.630
Cars now a days, actually these days,
cars are having more and more networking.

82
00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.850
And you may have heard of this in
the news, but cars are networked actually,

83
00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.700
so you can, for instance,
remote start a car, right?

84
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.060
Start it when you're not near the car,
you can start it through the network.

85
00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.707
Cars also have,
what do they have in there?

86
00:04:29.707 --> 00:04:33.798
Those, I forget the name of the brand,
there's OnStar, is one brand name.

87
00:04:33.798 --> 00:04:38.308
But when there's an accident,
the car can, through the Internet,

88
00:04:38.308 --> 00:04:41.670
connect with 911 and
call and get help, right?

89
00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:44.020
So this type of thing is present in cars.

90
00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.610
My car does not have that.

91
00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.360
But I'm cheap and
I'm a professor, I buy old cars.

92
00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.200
So my cars are old but new modern cars
have these features built in there [LAUGH]

93
00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.944
and they are actually networked.

94
00:04:54.944 --> 00:04:58.078
So that would be a modern car.

95
00:04:58.078 --> 00:05:02.473
The most modern car, that would be an IoT
device because it has the computational

96
00:05:02.473 --> 00:05:06.104
intelligence and it's also
networked to add extra flexibility.

97
00:05:06.104 --> 00:05:08.272
So, that's one device.

98
00:05:08.272 --> 00:05:10.100
Let's take a look at another.

99
00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:11.550
Let's talk about logistics.

100
00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.256
Tracking things okay, logistics.

101
00:05:14.256 --> 00:05:18.724
So say you are Walmart or some big company
or your the military, something like that,

102
00:05:18.724 --> 00:05:21.455
and you want to move lots
of things between different

103
00:05:21.455 --> 00:05:23.581
places on a certain time scale, right?

104
00:05:23.581 --> 00:05:28.478
You need to get these from this
manufacturing place to this sales

105
00:05:28.478 --> 00:05:30.880
place on this schedule.

106
00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.120
That's logistics.

107
00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.226
And the military is all about logistics,
right?

108
00:05:34.226 --> 00:05:35.495
We are waging a war.

109
00:05:35.495 --> 00:05:37.524
We need to get these devices
from here to here and

110
00:05:37.524 --> 00:05:39.675
these people from here to
here on this time frame.

111
00:05:39.675 --> 00:05:41.250
So you wanna move things.

112
00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:42.992
So say you're Walmart, and

113
00:05:42.992 --> 00:05:47.210
you would have to be able to track
these devices that you're moving.

114
00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:50.650
You wanna make sure that they are moving
place to place in a certain time frame.

115
00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.870
And you want to be able to at any time,
be able to say,

116
00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.490
where is box number whatever, right?

117
00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:00.160
How many boxes do we have of this type
of device at this location at this time?

118
00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.330
And you need to be able to
track that dynamically, so

119
00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.370
you can get count for things like,
weather difficulties, right?

120
00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:07.160
Maybe the planes are shut down so

121
00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.310
you can't move enough
devices from here to here.

122
00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:12.389
So you need to know how many are here so
you can reroute things.

123
00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:17.972
So, to do that, one way,
a very common way, is to use barcodes.

124
00:06:17.972 --> 00:06:22.195
This helps you because every box, every
device, it has a barcode which has some

125
00:06:22.195 --> 00:06:25.045
basic information about what's in the box,
right?

126
00:06:25.045 --> 00:06:28.930
And where the box came from,
stuff like that, gets stuck on the box.

127
00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.190
Now, barcodes are in
very common use today.

128
00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:34.910
We use barcodes, if you look at any
food item, you go to the supermarket and

129
00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:37.720
you check yourself out,
you run the barcode over the scanner.

130
00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.670
So barcodes are very useful and
they have a certain amount of

131
00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:44.150
information on there and they make it so
that you can just scan the device and

132
00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:46.830
find out information about the device,
or whatever it is, the box.

133
00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:47.829
And it makes it easy to track.

134
00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:52.990
So this is basically old technology,
barcodes have been around for a long time.

135
00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:57.050
Nowadays, you also find RFID tags.

136
00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:00.520
So RFID tags, you can see the antenna,
for one, right there.

137
00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:05.055
It's basically an electronic
version of a bar code.

138
00:07:05.055 --> 00:07:08.240
And what you're seeing is
that sort of spiraling wire,

139
00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:10.488
that's actually the antenna, okay?

140
00:07:10.488 --> 00:07:12.090
A remote antenna.

141
00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:16.438
And what RFID tags allow you to do, why
they're an improvement over barcodes is,

142
00:07:16.438 --> 00:07:20.041
the first thing is, they basically
have a processor inside there.

143
00:07:20.041 --> 00:07:23.607
So you can have a lot more information
about the device than what you

144
00:07:23.607 --> 00:07:25.779
could encode inside a barcode, right?

145
00:07:25.779 --> 00:07:27.570
A ton more information.

146
00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:29.147
And that information can change, right?

147
00:07:29.147 --> 00:07:33.356
Because barcode, once you print that on
the box, that will never change, right?

148
00:07:33.356 --> 00:07:35.710
Until you rip off the barcode,
put a new barcode on.

149
00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:36.860
But that data can never change.

150
00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:41.140
With an RFID tag, that thing could have
flash memory in there if you want to,

151
00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:44.920
that actually reloads,
that gets changed and updated over time.

152
00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:48.560
So for instance, if you want to track
where a box moved, t he box itself and

153
00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:51.740
it's RFID can store that
information over time.

154
00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:54.002
So, as it moves from place to
place you can store that and

155
00:07:54.002 --> 00:07:56.281
you can see the whole path
that the box took, all right?

156
00:07:56.281 --> 00:07:58.544
So, RFID another benefit of these,

157
00:07:58.544 --> 00:08:02.200
is that you don't have to be
right next to them to scan them.

158
00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:05.324
So, if you know anything about a barcode,
you have to take a scanner and

159
00:08:05.324 --> 00:08:08.570
put it right up to the barcode in order
to scan it, you have to try, right?

160
00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:11.480
You have to, I mean, if you ever scan,
like just yesterday I was at Albertson's,

161
00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:12.700
scanning food out.

162
00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:17.200
I have to work to get that scanner
directly over my barcode, right?

163
00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:19.030
With RFID tags, there's a range.

164
00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:21.530
So you just have to be within proximity.

165
00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:23.380
You don't have to have any
particular orientation.

166
00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:25.600
Just be near it, which is helpful, right?

167
00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:29.420
Then you can just run every box
near a scanner, and it'll catch it.

168
00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:34.770
So RFID tags have a lot of advantages over
barcodes and they can easily be networked.

169
00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:37.610
So the scanner can be network
connected to the Internet so

170
00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:42.210
you can keep constant track of where
all your boxes are at some global site.

171
00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:47.320
So Walmart can know where every box is and
what manufacturer, what plant it's in.

172
00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:51.990
And they can keep it all centrally
because the IoT RFID scanner is

173
00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:56.499
actually connected on the network
to its main cloud service.

174
00:08:56.499 --> 00:09:02.779
So, devices can become an IoT
device if you put RFID tags and

175
00:09:02.779 --> 00:09:07.558
the computational intelligence on to them.

176
00:09:07.558 --> 00:09:08.500
Thank you.

177
00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:16.809
