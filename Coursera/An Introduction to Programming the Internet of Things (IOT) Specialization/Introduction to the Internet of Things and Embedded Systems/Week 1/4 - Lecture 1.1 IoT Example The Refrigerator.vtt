2
00:00:09.736 --> 00:00:12.898
The point of this lecture is
really to just introduce the term

3
00:00:12.898 --> 00:00:14.021
Internet of Things.

4
00:00:14.021 --> 00:00:17.123
Just to define the term,
give you some kind of a general idea

5
00:00:17.123 --> 00:00:20.114
of what Internet of Things really is,
what it's about.

6
00:00:20.114 --> 00:00:23.109
So we'll go through an example,
a refrigerator example.

7
00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:26.812
And talk about how a refrigerator can be
integrated into the Internet of Things,

8
00:00:26.812 --> 00:00:28.880
and how it’s different
than just a regular,

9
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.560
traditional refrigerator that
you are probably used to.

10
00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.080
So let’s break down the term
Internet of Things.

11
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.550
We're probably gonna start off
with a thing of some kind.

12
00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.240
So in this case we're talking
about a refrigerator and

13
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:48.140
a refrigerator is just a thing, so
it can be anything besides a computer.

14
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.230
Right?
If it's a computer,

15
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.525
we're not calling that a thing,
but anything besides a computer.

16
00:00:51.525 --> 00:00:54.610
Besides a traditional computer,
a laptop, desktop,

17
00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.480
server type of device,
you'll call that a thing of some kind.

18
00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.840
And it has some features.

19
00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:59.940
It has some use.

20
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.900
So in the case of a refrigerator like
this, we know what a refrigerator does.

21
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.670
It keeps things cold and so on.

22
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:05.600
So you start off with a thing.

23
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.770
Now the next thing you
do is you add to that

24
00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.330
some type of computational intelligence.

25
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.340
Usually that involves a processor
like what we're showing here.

26
00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.500
That's actually a picture
of an R-Dweeno but

27
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.520
it could be any type of
computational intelligence.

28
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.360
Typically it's a micro controller of
some kind, running some kind of code.

29
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.560
So, you see these devices
all around your house.

30
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.130
But it's the computer inside, right?

31
00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.360
So it doesn't look like a computer,
it looks like a thing of some kind.

32
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.290
It looks like a refrigerator, but
it actually has computational intelligence

33
00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.840
inside, so it's really
a computer hidden on the inside.

34
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.260
And it's somehow is used to improve
the functionality of the device,

35
00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.030
to make the device do what it did before,
but better.

36
00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.010
So that's what you start with, you start
with a thing, you add some intelligence,

37
00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.790
some computer technology inside it.

38
00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.060
Then, to top it off,
you add Internet connectivity.

39
00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.630
Now, this is very common in things, and

40
00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.900
that's where the term Internet
of things comes from.

41
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.390
You add some kind of
Internet connectivity.

42
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.200
So now you've got a thing.

43
00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.280
It's got some kind of computation inside
and it's got a network connection which

44
00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.250
means it can use all sorts of other
resources that are not local.

45
00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.864
Right?

46
00:02:18.864 --> 00:02:19.480
It can reach on the Internet.

47
00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.210
It's potentially accessible
from this IoT device.

48
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:29.140
So all that put together is generally
what you'd call an IoT device,

49
00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.740
an Internet of Things device.

50
00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.740
You take the thing,
you put some intelligence in there, and

51
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.608
you put some network connectivity.

52
00:02:35.608 --> 00:02:38.540
And remember that, from the outside,

53
00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.220
this device doesn't look that much
different than it used to look, right?

54
00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.550
It doesn't look like a computer,
that's the main thing.

55
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:45.410
It doesn't look like a computer.

56
00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.460
It doesn't have a full on keyboard and
a screen, it might have a screen,

57
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.370
a few little buttons on it but
it doesn't look like a standard computer.

58
00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.220
You don't have to install Windows or
iOS or Android or

59
00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.790
whatever the operating system is.

60
00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.370
It's none of that complexity.

61
00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.250
So it's much simpler to use,
just like the original thing was.

62
00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.130
So if you look at the now,

63
00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.020
the new refrigerator,
it's not gonna be hard to use.

64
00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.690
You still open a door, close a door,
plug it into the wall, that sort of thing.

65
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:11.760
Get ice out of it.

66
00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.553
The same old simple interface.

67
00:03:15.785 --> 00:03:20.010
So traditional refrigerator,
keeps items cold, right?

68
00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.870
This is a non Internet of Things.

69
00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.660
Keeps items cold, you put things in it,
food, whatever it is.

70
00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.910
A real simple interface, all right?

71
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.260
Everybody knows how to use it, and
decades ago it was the same interface.

72
00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.210
Right?
A hundred years ago, I don't know if they,

73
00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:35.170
yeah I guess I suppose they had
refrigerators a hundred years ago.

74
00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.440
Hundred years ago, you had a refrigerator
that looked basically the same thing.

75
00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.230
Now, an intelligent refrigerator,
I'm using that term to mean refrigerator

76
00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.030
that now has some kind of
computational intelligence inside it.

77
00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.570
And you see a lot of this
inside refrigerators nowadays.

78
00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.480
My fridge is like this.

79
00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.570
So, for instance,
it'll warn you when the door is ajar.

80
00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.290
Usually it'll beep in some way, but
it could talk to you if it wanted to,

81
00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:00.190
it doesn't matter.

82
00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:01.590
But it'll warn you that.

83
00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.600
It basically has some sort of sensors
built in that tells if the doors are shut.

84
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.340
And if they're open for a certain amount
of time, maybe they start a timer,

85
00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.250
if they're open for a certain amount
of time, an alarm goes off and

86
00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.170
that requires some kind of
computational intelligence.

87
00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.590
It might tell you when the water
filter need replacing.

88
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.100
Mine is annoying in that way,
it tells me the same thing.

89
00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.130
So it starts beeping every
time I try to get water now,

90
00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.910
in fact right now I need a filter.

91
00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.290
So it just beeps and beeps and beeps
every time I try to get water out of it.

92
00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:31.390
So again it has some type of timer
where it keeps track of the date.

93
00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:34.970
Says okay, this many days have gone by
since you last refilled the filters,

94
00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:35.870
you changed it.

95
00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.830
So again requires
computational intelligence.

96
00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.990
Note that it doesn't require
networking yet right?

97
00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.620
These tasks are just computational tasks.

98
00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.580
It could tell you when
you're low on butter.

99
00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.420
Now my fridge doesn't do this, but
you can imagine a refrigerator

100
00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:52.040
that has some sort of a sensor
in there that can sense.

101
00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:57.060
Maybe it has a camera in your butter tray
and it senses when your butter is low.

102
00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.350
Right?
Maybe it tests the weight of your butter.

103
00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.870
Right?

104
00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:01.610
And if the weight is too low it says,
okay.

105
00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:02.510
There isn't butter in here.

106
00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:03.390
You are low on butter.

107
00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:05.240
It could easily warn you of that.

108
00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.280
Now mine doesn't do that.

109
00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.870
There are refrigerators that
can do that sort of thing.

110
00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:11.160
But, again,
local intelligence is required.

111
00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.590
No real networking required to do that.

112
00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.900
It could also tell you when you buy
foods that are high on fat content.

113
00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:22.110
Now, this I've never actually seen such
a refrigerator, but you could do this.

114
00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:26.360
You could take a picture, the fridge
itself could have a camera inside.

115
00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.850
Could take a picture of the food that
you ordered, look it up in some type of

116
00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:33.230
a library of food that it has,
and look at the food content,

117
00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:37.600
look at the fat content and cholesterol
and so on, and it could warn you, right?

118
00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.540
And it could do this with local data,
without network connectivity,

119
00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:41.170
if you need it to.

120
00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:44.810
You can also have a set of recipes
programmed into your refrigerator.

121
00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:46.790
I know there are refrigerators
that have this.

122
00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:49.420
They can be programmed into your fridge
and they can suggest recipes for

123
00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:51.670
you based on the foods it sees inside.

124
00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:54.460
So you've got milk, you've got butter,
you've got this, you've got that,

125
00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:56.120
you can make pancakes today.

126
00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.230
Something like this.

127
00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:58.880
So, that's another thing that,

128
00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:03.040
another feature that you can add on to an
intelligent refrigerator if you wanted to.

129
00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.290
And it requires this computational
intelligence inside the refrigerator to do

130
00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:09.020
that, also sensors, like cameras maybe,

131
00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:13.610
weight sensors, door sensors to see if the
doors open and close, something like that.

132
00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:14.840
And using all that together,

133
00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.640
you can enhance the properties
of the refrigerator.

134
00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:20.370
So now this refrigerator, it does a lot
more than what it used to do, but

135
00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.200
it's still very easy to use, right?

136
00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:23.610
You don't have to do anything complicated.

137
00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:27.080
It tells you the door is ajar,
or something like that.

138
00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:30.440
It's not extra work for you,
no learning curve, all right.

139
00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.140
So, you might call that
an intelligent refrigerator, but

140
00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:34.720
you'll notice that these
features that I'm listing here.

141
00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:37.830
They don't require network
connectivity in general.

142
00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:39.760
So these things that I'm listing here,

143
00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:42.240
they can do that with local sensors,
right?

144
00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:47.390
And local processing that sense what's
in your fridge and respond to you and

145
00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:47.940
give you information.

146
00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:50.810
So that's intelligent refrigerator.

147
00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:53.010
But maybe you wouldn't call
that Internet of Things,

148
00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:54.260
cuz it's not actually networked yet.

149
00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.930
So the ultimate, the IoT refrigerator.

150
00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:02.380
The IoT refrigerator is basically
the computational intelligence,

151
00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:04.530
but also network connectivity.

152
00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:08.430
With the network connectivity you can add
another set of features on top of that,

153
00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:10.710
that you couldn't have added
without the network connectivity.

154
00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:14.120
For instance, you can have your
refrigerator actually order food for

155
00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:15.190
you when the stock is low.

156
00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:17.780
That could easily happen.

157
00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:20.490
It can check,
it could just go straight to Amazon.

158
00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:24.850
Amazon, I guess I shouldn't advertise,
but there are services

159
00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:28.790
from which you can go to supermarkets and
order food, I use one of these services.

160
00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:30.950
And they deliver food the next morning,
actually.

161
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:31.740
It's pretty amazing.

162
00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:34.170
Seven in the morning and
the food will be there in the door step.

163
00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:37.430
So, you can have your fridge detect
that you are low on butter and then just

164
00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:41.820
order that, and then the next morning,
butter will appear on your doorstep.

165
00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:43.270
But that requires network connectivity.

166
00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:46.710
You have to be able to connect to
the network, and place the order,

167
00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:49.270
grab money out of your bank account,
right,

168
00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:51.820
transfer it to whoever you're
purchasing it from, things like that.

169
00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:55.180
You can search for low food prices.

170
00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:58.830
So it also suggest to you look,
you might wanna buy this item.

171
00:07:58.830 --> 00:07:59.820
You're low on butter.

172
00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:03.050
Buy butter from here rather than
there because it's cheaper.

173
00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:06.700
And in fact, it can go ahead and just
buy that, or it can just suggest to you.

174
00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:08.880
But again,
that requires network connectivity.

175
00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:11.960
It would have to connect to the network,
go search around different sites,

176
00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:15.050
different super market sites, find the
different prices, compare them, and so on.

177
00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:18.380
It could order a water-filter
when you need a water-filter.

178
00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:22.380
So rather than annoying me and telling me,
you need water-filter beep beep beep.

179
00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:24.630
It can just go and order that,
and it could appear for

180
00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:27.000
me, UPS could deliver it the next day.

181
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:27.870
Right.

182
00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:30.700
So it can anticipate meals.

183
00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:31.950
It can be predictive.

184
00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:35.930
So it can know what kind of food
you have in your fridge and

185
00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:39.385
order what you need for
tomorrow's meals, right.

186
00:08:39.385 --> 00:08:41.925
Took, and say oh, a good idea for food for

187
00:08:41.925 --> 00:08:44.905
you tomorrow is this type of meal
that you've had in the past.

188
00:08:44.905 --> 00:08:47.445
I will order whatever you need for
that meal, and

189
00:08:47.445 --> 00:08:49.255
then it'll appear in your
doorstep the next morning.

190
00:08:49.255 --> 00:08:51.885
And then you'll have everything you need
to cook what you need for the next day.

191
00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:54.830
It can search news.

192
00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:57.160
Probably it could actually do
more global type of searching.

193
00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:00.710
It could look on news prices to see
what global trends are, so for instance.

194
00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:03.260
And this is elaborate, but
you could certainly do this.

195
00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:06.760
It could look at news trends and
say, oh it's El Nino.

196
00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:10.550
Right, the world is
getting colder this year.

197
00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:12.850
That means that fruits are gonna
be more expensive, right.

198
00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:15.080
So I better stock up on fruits right now,

199
00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:18.400
because I know that in a few months
I won't be able to get them, right.

200
00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:20.650
Your machine can do that,
your fridge could do that.

201
00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:23.520
Now I've never heard of a refrigerator
that does that, but that is certainly

202
00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:27.720
possible, if you have the computational
intelligence inside the fridge and

203
00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:30.020
you have network connectivity so
it can actually execute the searches.

204
00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:34.620
It could also provide information to

205
00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:38.030
businesses to tell them
what you're buying, right?

206
00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:41.000
Now this maybe is not an advantage to you,
but certainly

207
00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:45.540
some store that's selling different type
of food, it might want to market to you,

208
00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:49.220
so they might want to know these people
are buying this type of food a lot.

209
00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:52.195
So maybe we wanna market
that type of food to them.

210
00:09:52.195 --> 00:09:54.886
That's another thing that
these devices do, and

211
00:09:54.886 --> 00:09:57.457
we'll talk a little bit
more about that later.

212
00:10:00.573 --> 00:10:01.245
Thanks.

213
00:10:01.245 --> 00:10:09.639
