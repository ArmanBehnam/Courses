2
00:00:09.745 --> 00:00:13.888
This lecture we'll talk about
the pervasive nature of IoT.

3
00:00:13.888 --> 00:00:16.084
The fact that IoT is everywhere,
[LAUGH] and

4
00:00:16.084 --> 00:00:19.590
even though we're not necessarily
aware of it all the time.

5
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.972
It's there and it's helpful,
generally helpful.

6
00:00:22.972 --> 00:00:26.100
So not only is it everywhere,
it's also networked.

7
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.230
So it gives you access to all these
abilities, all these features of things

8
00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.470
that are in the network and
it gives you access to them at all times.

9
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.300
So it's sort of a constant connection.

10
00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.500
So there are a lot of abilities to that,
it makes it very powerful.

11
00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.410
So first, a lot of what you
can think of as IoT devices,

12
00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.240
you can see them as an interface
to the Cloud, right?

13
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.330
By the Cloud, I mean big,
powerful compute servers

14
00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.110
that are accessed through the Internet,
so we'll call it the Cloud.

15
00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.660
And these compute servers can
do a variety of things for you.

16
00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.880
And we can see that devices,
small devices,

17
00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:08.070
IoT devices, are basically
a window to these Cloud servers.

18
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.390
So take Siri, Siri's an example
we're talking about here.

19
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.950
You can see that as a window into

20
00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.570
the Cloud servers that have
gigantic databases of information.

21
00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.700
So you can ask Siri some question,
it will go search for

22
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.850
the answer inside some massive cloud
database and give you the answer back.

23
00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:32.440
So really your IoT device in
that sense is just a window

24
00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.190
into some massive computational resource.

25
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.380
So not everything is going
on on your IoT device.

26
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.960
So say we're talking
about Siri specifically,

27
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.220
your phone has to do some computation,
speech-to-text, right?

28
00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.260
It has to figure out what you're saying.

29
00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.690
But the actual query that you state,

30
00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.570
that's not actually processed
directly on the phone.

31
00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.582
That thing is sent to the Cloud,
and the Cloud processes it,

32
00:01:54.582 --> 00:01:58.918
gives you the result and
Siri recites it back to you.

33
00:01:58.918 --> 00:02:03.224
So you can see that these IoT
devices actually give you,

34
00:02:03.224 --> 00:02:08.171
they leverage a much bigger set
of servers that are available out

35
00:02:08.171 --> 00:02:11.120
there on the Cloud if you want them to.

36
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.050
For instance, viewing movies,
say Netflix, something like that,

37
00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.340
the movies aren't sitting there on
your phone or whatever the device is.

38
00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.070
The movies, your phone, or

39
00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.000
whatever the IoT device is is really
a conduit for viewing the movie, right?

40
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.770
You're really going to some big servers,
Netflix servers.

41
00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.760
You're streaming the movie
directly off of those servers.

42
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.214
So your device is in some ways just
a conduit to something much more powerful

43
00:02:34.214 --> 00:02:35.992
than your actual IoT device.

44
00:02:35.992 --> 00:02:41.102
So there are a lot of IoT devices
that act in that way that are just

45
00:02:41.102 --> 00:02:46.320
access points for something much
bigger out there in the Cloud.

46
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.398
So this is basically leveraging the
networking features of these IoT devices.

47
00:02:50.398 --> 00:02:54.566
So that basically just what I was saying,
you can access these large databases,

48
00:02:54.566 --> 00:02:58.613
large computational service to get,
whatever access to whatever kind of data

49
00:02:58.613 --> 00:03:02.046
you wanna get, and to do,
perform things that you wanna perform,

50
00:03:02.046 --> 00:03:04.712
format operations that you
need to form remotely.

51
00:03:07.014 --> 00:03:09.360
So, IoT is also pervasive.

52
00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.037
Since networking is pervasive, IoT is
pervasive, which means it is everywhere.

53
00:03:13.037 --> 00:03:16.494
It is embedded in devices and
you're not necessarily aware of that, but

54
00:03:16.494 --> 00:03:20.519
they're are all over the place and if you
just look around whatever room you're in,

55
00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.350
you'll probably see these devices.

56
00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.625
I mean, of course, I'm staring down a
camera right now, so that's an IoT device.

57
00:03:26.625 --> 00:03:29.304
There are cameras all over,
microphones and all this,

58
00:03:29.304 --> 00:03:30.900
projectors, things like this.

59
00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.188
They're all in this room.

60
00:03:32.188 --> 00:03:38.210
My watch, my phone, they're all over
the place just helping me in various ways.

61
00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:41.853
So if you look at your house, you think
about inside your house, how many

62
00:03:41.853 --> 00:03:46.970
computers you have inside of your house,
traditional computers, laptop, desktop.

63
00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.830
I probably have probably four or
five laptop, desktop machines in my house.

64
00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.920
But if I think of how many IoT
devices I have, a lot more, right.

65
00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:01.140
I just, see my DVR, right, my fridge,

66
00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.280
my microwave oven, my TV,
my game machine, right?

67
00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.355
My several, I have several.

68
00:04:06.355 --> 00:04:08.850
[LAUGH] I have XBox One.

69
00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:10.300
I have all these.

70
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.170
So I have my watch, my phones,
my kids' phones, right?

71
00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.980
There's so
many IoT devices just everywhere.

72
00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.830
Home automation systems, I do not
have a home automation system, but

73
00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:23.070
that's a common use.

74
00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.560
Home automation systems that
are connected to the network, so you can,

75
00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.700
you've probably seen commercials
on this type of thing.

76
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.980
You can go to your cell phone and turn off
your lights at home from your cell phone,

77
00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.390
things like this, right.

78
00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:38.090
So, IoT devices are pervasive and
they're just everywhere.

79
00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.945
At work, too, so, at home, at work.

80
00:04:41.945 --> 00:04:46.120
At work, well, my work,
we have motion sensors in every room.

81
00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.920
For lighting, right,

82
00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.970
to save the power on lights, the lights
go off if there's no motion in the room.

83
00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.760
So they have motion sensors in every room,
down every hall,

84
00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.840
checking to see if something's moving and
if they need to keep the lights off or on.

85
00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.650
And you've probably been
in places like that.

86
00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:00.870
Also RFID tags.

87
00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.569
I need an RFID tag to get
into my building, right.

88
00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:06.840
I run it past the machine and
it lets me in.

89
00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.150
So there's also this type of,
my phone, that's another thing.

90
00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.530
My phone, phones nowadays,
there's cell phones.

91
00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:17.506
But there's also even desktop phones
nowadays are in Internet things devices,

92
00:05:17.506 --> 00:05:20.080
right, cuz these are Voice-over IP phones.

93
00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.650
My phone is a networked phone.

94
00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.530
It sends data over the Internet directly.

95
00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:25.900
It doesn't even use
the regular phone system.

96
00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.600
It goes straight to the Internet, right.

97
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:35.368
So phones, everything, lots of different
devices are IoT devices, even at work.

98
00:05:35.368 --> 00:05:36.731
Also on your person, so

99
00:05:36.731 --> 00:05:40.287
these things are now integrated
into your body in some sense.

100
00:05:40.287 --> 00:05:41.690
So hopefully, not too close.

101
00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:45.921
But health trackers, right, these
things are strapped onto your wrist and

102
00:05:45.921 --> 00:05:50.100
they can track heart rate, all sorts
of features they can track about you.

103
00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.315
And they're strapped onto you,
they are networked.

104
00:05:52.315 --> 00:05:54.702
So by Bluetooth,
they go to the Internet and

105
00:05:54.702 --> 00:05:58.070
maybe send that information to a server,
to a global server.

106
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.430
And if you have one of these things,
like a Fitbit or

107
00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:02.770
something like that,
you know how they work.

108
00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:04.360
Pacemakers, oh, those are the ultimate.

109
00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.008
Those are literally embedded within
you and they control your heart.

110
00:06:08.008 --> 00:06:10.340
Actually, pacemakers
are quite sophisticated.

111
00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:15.600
They track your heart, but say your heart
stops, they can restart your heart.

112
00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.770
They can give you a charge, right?

113
00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:21.290
Give you a shock and
start that heart again automatically.

114
00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:22.890
And they are also networked.

115
00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:25.330
So you have to be able to program them,
reset them periodically.

116
00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:28.540
So they are usually not
regularly networked but

117
00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:31.530
when the doctor wants to reset it in
the office, he can do that by radio.

118
00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:35.330
Insulin pumps, so these are common, too.

119
00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.510
Actually, I knew a guy,
I meant to bring one to lecture today.

120
00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:42.724
But I knew a guy, he had diabetes,
type 2, I believe,

121
00:06:42.724 --> 00:06:47.327
but it was pretty severe, and
you need insulin injections.

122
00:06:47.327 --> 00:06:51.068
What he had was a device like what you see
here where it would give the injections,

123
00:06:51.068 --> 00:06:54.950
while during the day, it would sort
of inject him at the right rate.

124
00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:57.090
And he had to have this under his shirt.

125
00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:58.830
He had this device,
a device like what you see in there.

126
00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:00.460
It was taped under his shirt.

127
00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:03.715
And it would know how much insulin
to give him on a regular basis.

128
00:07:03.715 --> 00:07:06.460
So he didn't have to do it,
it just gave it to him.

129
00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:07.950
So diabetes is one of those things.

130
00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:11.110
It's about regulation,
regulating the insulin level.

131
00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:13.250
So your body normally does this.

132
00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:15.848
If your pancreas is working,
it does this perfectly, right.

133
00:07:15.848 --> 00:07:18.814
It senses how much sugar you
have in your bloodstream,

134
00:07:18.814 --> 00:07:22.250
it puts in insulin in the right
dose to keep it level.

135
00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:24.560
But if your pancreas isn't working,
then you have diabetes and

136
00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:27.170
you need a device,
an external device, to do that.

137
00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:31.770
Now you can do it manually or you can have
a device like these insulin pumps which

138
00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:35.900
actually do it for you and they push
in the insulin at the appropriate rate.

139
00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:39.520
So these things are basically
integrated into you, right?

140
00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:42.100
Now cell phones are not
integrated into you, not quite,

141
00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:45.700
they are not quite connected to your ear,
but I know a lot of people who cannot

142
00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:48.090
leave their house without
their cell phone, right?

143
00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:50.250
So you forget it, you're like,
look, I gotta go home,

144
00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:51.480
I have to have that thing with me.

145
00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:53.940
So it's not physically connected but
it might as well be.

146
00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:57.505
All right, pervasive.

147
00:07:57.505 --> 00:08:01.915
So other places, not even on your person,
but everywhere, on the streets, right?

148
00:08:01.915 --> 00:08:03.545
So I watch TV.

149
00:08:03.545 --> 00:08:04.625
I watch Law and Order a lot.

150
00:08:04.625 --> 00:08:09.173
How many times have I seen the cops
in Law and Order, this is TV, but

151
00:08:09.173 --> 00:08:13.968
using video surveillance devices,
you know, the ATM had a camera and

152
00:08:13.968 --> 00:08:16.908
they used that to catch the crook, right.

153
00:08:16.908 --> 00:08:19.961
There are devices all over the place
that are surveilling us for

154
00:08:19.961 --> 00:08:21.977
beneficial purposes, okay.

155
00:08:21.977 --> 00:08:24.737
Like traffic light cams, okay.

156
00:08:24.737 --> 00:08:29.220
Now traffic light cams, it's beneficial,
right, they gotta ticket you.

157
00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:34.150
I don't like it, right, but I can see the
social benefit to being able to track when

158
00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:37.116
somebody runs a light and
giving people tickets.

159
00:08:37.116 --> 00:08:39.230
Otherwise everybody would be
running lights all the time, right.

160
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:42.290
So that type of thing, that type of
surveillance, goes on all the time.

161
00:08:42.290 --> 00:08:47.080
Actually In London,
their traffic cameras do more than that.

162
00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:49.080
They actually track your
license plate numbers.

163
00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:53.220
So they can track criminals by
