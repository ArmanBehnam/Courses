[MUSIC]

2
00:00:10.446 --> 00:00:14.990
So in this lecture we'll discuss some
of the downsides of Internet of Things

3
00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.824
technology, some of the risks,
and especially the privacy and

4
00:00:18.824 --> 00:00:23.794
security issues that come up when you have
IoT devices as pervasive as they are doing

5
00:00:23.794 --> 00:00:26.570
things and
out of your control at some extent.

6
00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:32.390
So, one advantage that we
listed in the last lecture

7
00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.350
was that you don't have to
depend on people as much.

8
00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.030
You can depend on your IoT
device to do things for you, and

9
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.100
you don't have to deal
with people as much.

10
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.480
So the downside of that is
potential social isolation, right?

11
00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.640
You don't have to leave your
house if you don't want to.

12
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:46.680
You can be a hermit.

13
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.640
Stay in your house, never walk out,
and have everything come to you.

14
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.150
Right?

15
00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.215
Now, usually it doesn't go to
that extreme, but it can happen.

16
00:00:54.215 --> 00:00:57.500
It depends on the mindset of
the person who's using the device.

17
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.820
But if you need to
interact with people less,

18
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.206
you have less of an excuse to go
out there and deal with people.

19
00:01:02.206 --> 00:01:05.620
And this picture is showing all these
people looking at their cell phones.

20
00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.730
This a constant problem, right?

21
00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.930
People looking at their phones even
in quote unquote, social engagements.

22
00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.270
Say you're at a party and
people at the party, which is meant for

23
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.390
human interaction,
reading their cellphones and

24
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.370
looking down at their devices
rather than actually interacting.

25
00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:26.235
So, you can have this increased risk of
social isolation because you don't have to

26
00:01:26.235 --> 00:01:27.778
to interact with people.

27
00:01:31.074 --> 00:01:36.017
Another big problem with IoT is that
you're now more dependent on technology,

28
00:01:36.017 --> 00:01:39.350
and all the infrastructure
that comes along with it.

29
00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.540
So, if things go down,
like for instance my email.

30
00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.550
And this is not even really
an Internet of Things issue.

31
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.510
But, email, I use it on a standard
computer or my phone too, if I want to.

32
00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.720
But if email goes down,
it's a serious impediment to me.

33
00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.320
I need my email on a daily basis,
really, an hourly basis.

34
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.170
I need to get emails from people.

35
00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.920
And so, when that type of thing goes down,
it's a problem for work and

36
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.582
even for personal life, right?

37
00:02:09.582 --> 00:02:12.270
I communicate with some people personally
with some people through email,

38
00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.090
or texting or
whatever communication technology you use.

39
00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.660
When you're using it through IoT, through
the internet, and through your devices,

40
00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.710
when your device goes down, or

41
00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.050
when the network itself goes down,
it's a big problem for you.

42
00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.290
So, power outages in
general are a big problem

43
00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.240
because all your devices are going down.

44
00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.000
I mean their charges are gonna
die even if they're on battery.

45
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.650
But if your device goes down.

46
00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.140
So for instance, If my phone, so
this happens to my wife all the time.

47
00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.740
She has a phone.

48
00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:41.490
I won't say the brand.

49
00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.300
She has a popular phone.

50
00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:44.800
When she gets an update on her phone,

51
00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.860
like she just recently got
an update on her phone.

52
00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.530
The thing just hangs up.

53
00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.470
Regularly.
Just yesterday, she's talking to me and

54
00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.230
suddenly it hangs up.

55
00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.970
She talks to me again.

56
00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.650
It hangs up for no reason, right.

57
00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.782
Because the update that was
supposed to improve her device.

58
00:02:56.782 --> 00:03:02.170
So now, her being dependent
on this device all the time,

59
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.900
when she gets an update and it goes wrong,

60
00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.880
when there are bugs in the software,
it's a much more serious problem.

61
00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.790
And buggy software is always
a problem on a desktop,

62
00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.940
say, but
when it's something that you use a lot.

63
00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.890
For instance,
if it's a life critical thing,

64
00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.150
like we talked about insulin
pumps a couple of lectures back.

65
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.980
If that thing has a bug,
that's a serious problem.

66
00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.630
I mean, you can die off of that, right?

67
00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.120
A pacemaker has a bug,
there's a serious problem.

68
00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.720
And these things actually
happened in medical devices too,

69
00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.360
that you've had these bugs and
people have died.

70
00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.900
We won't go into them,
I don't have slides on these right now.

71
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.720
But there are devices
that this has happened.

72
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.740
And the more these IoT devices
get integrated into our lives,

73
00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.340
the more dependent we are.

74
00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.450
So when they go wrong,
it's a much worse problem for us.

75
00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:52.220
Privacy and Security.

76
00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.160
So another property of these
IoT devices is they are,

77
00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.570
they're recording information.

78
00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.320
They are observing us.

79
00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.360
Now, presumably for our benefit.

80
00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.410
But they are observing us a lot and
they are pervasive, so everywhere.

81
00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.330
So for instance, your cell phone.

82
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.620
That thing is observing your location.

83
00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.230
If you have your location services on,

84
00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.450
which most people have on because a lot
of applications depend on those services.

85
00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:20.580
You have that on, it is reported your GPS,
your location at all times, and it can

86
00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:26.440
easily be sending that data back to Apple
or whoever, whoever your manufacture is.

87
00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.150
And that happens all the time.

88
00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.270
This type of data is being
tracked by your phone, and

89
00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.450
sent back to some central location.

90
00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:36.990
Now maybe they're using it for
good purposes, to help you.

91
00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.380
Like having your location means
that when you're looking for

92
00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.560
a restaurant, you don't have to report
your location, it just knows, and

93
00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.100
it can tell you where all
the nearby restaurants are.

94
00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.040
So that can be beneficial.

95
00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.810
But it is tracking you all the time.

96
00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:49.790
Health monitors.

97
00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.540
They're tracking your health information,
right, all the time, and

98
00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.410
sending them on a network
to some cloud server.

99
00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.510
So there's important
information about your health

100
00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.920
that is being transmitted over the network
and stored in some remote server.

101
00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.440
TV watching habits, media watching,
whatever media you're watching.

102
00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.051
That type of thing is.

103
00:05:09.051 --> 00:05:12.146
So, say you've got a new TV, it can track,

104
00:05:12.146 --> 00:05:15.350
in fact it typically
records what you watch.

105
00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:21.010
In fact, my DVR it flags,
when I'm looking at the list of TV shows,

106
00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:23.300
it flags which ones it
thinks I'll want to watch.

107
00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.080
Now, how does it figure that out?

108
00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.775
It's tracking my activity, knows what
type of shows I've watched in the past,

109
00:05:28.775 --> 00:05:30.750
finds similar shows and
suggest them to me.

110
00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.500
So that's a benefit, right?

111
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.880
But just understand that it is tracking
everything that you're watching

112
00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.850
on your TV or your DVR, things like this.

113
00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:43.160
Actually, we see this all the time with
people must have interacted with this,

114
00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.750
when you buy something online.

115
00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:48.660
So, one thing I do is I build
quad copters with my son.

116
00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:52.390
We build quad copters, I have a research
project on this, remote control, right?

117
00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:54.590
Whenever I make purchase
like a quad coptor purchase,

118
00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:58.090
suddenly all the ads I see are for
quad coptor parts.

119
00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:01.960
Motors and RC controls and all this, and
you must have interacted with this, right?

120
00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:06.460
It's tracking what you're buying,
and then just throwing ads at you.

121
00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:07.720
It's doing it for marketing purposes, but

122
00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:11.750
it's throwing ads at you according
to things you've bought in the past.

123
00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:16.550
So, purchasing habits, cellphone or
whatever device you're purchasing on.

124
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:19.080
Say if your refrigerator's making
purchases for you, food purchases for

125
00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:20.610
you or something like that,

126
00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:25.040
the fridge itself can track that data and
give it to some third party.

127
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:27.830
Driving habits.

128
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:30.930
So, cars have lots of sensors,
about the speed and

129
00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:34.880
things like that, and if you're hitting
the brake, something like that.

130
00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:39.860
And car incident reporting,
the insurance agencies can use that

131
00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.820
when you're trying to get money back for
your car.

132
00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:45.460
So say you crash your car and you say,
look, I was hitting the brake and

133
00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:48.180
they say, well, the car says
you weren't hitting the break.

134
00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:50.140
So, you owe us this much money, right?

135
00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:53.110
So that type of data is being recorded,
sent to insurance agencies, and

136
00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:58.240
they can use that against you.

137
00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.520
So, data can be used to market to you.

138
00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:06.700
I already mentioned this, but
the ads that you see on your computer or

139
00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:11.160
on your phone, those things happen,
they pick ads, basically selectively,

140
00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.360
based on what your purchase habits are.

141
00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.830
So, if they know you're interested in
buying a particular type of device,

142
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:16.990
you'll get ads related to that.

143
00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:19.160
Health problems.

144
00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:22.730
So, if they know you're on a certain
type of drug, they'll give you ads for

145
00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:25.580
related drugs for related issues,
things like this.

146
00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:30.270
So, that's probably the most popular
use of this data is marketing, right?

147
00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:37.260
Often you give

148
00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:42.460
permission to the person you purchase
the device from, you give them permission

149
00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:46.530
to use that data in those long
agreements that you click Okay to.

150
00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:51.210
So when you buy a device, buy a phone,
or put an application on your phone and

151
00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:54.260
it says do you accept the agreement terms?

152
00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.930
And you don't read that,
but you click Okay.

153
00:07:56.930 --> 00:08:00.610
So, in that, you are giving up
all ownership of all data often.

154
00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:02.980
Right?
So all this data that's being tracked,

155
00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:07.570
it can legally be given to
some third party agency,

156
00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:11.390
and then they can sell that
data whenever they want to.

157
00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:13.150
So, it's hard to keep track of your data.

158
00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:16.237
You don't know who has your data,

159
00:08:16.237 --> 00:08:21.890
because you agreed at some point
to allow them to own that data.

160
00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:23.498
Oh, insurance agencies.

161
00:08:23.498 --> 00:08:26.435
So, the car accidents, car insurance.

162
00:08:26.435 --> 00:08:29.235
They can track the data about your car
see how you were driving at the time of

163
00:08:29.235 --> 00:08:31.455
the accident and use that information.

164
00:08:31.455 --> 00:08:32.625
It could be used to your advantage.

165
00:08:32.625 --> 00:08:35.965
They could say oh, you did hit the brakes,
so it's not your fault.

166
00:08:35.965 --> 00:08:38.525
Or they could say look, you didn't
hit the brakes so it is your fault.

167
00:08:38.525 --> 00:08:39.545
So, it can be used either way.

168
00:08:40.615 --> 00:08:42.585
Also, undiagnosed health problems.

169
00:08:42.585 --> 00:08:45.175
So this is a little creepy but
this can certainly happen.

170
00:08:45.175 --> 00:08:48.820
So, insurance agencies
are basically statisticians.

171
00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:52.060
They do statistics to
determine health insurance.

172
00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:56.610
How much they are gonna charge you,
they do based on the state of your health.

173
00:08:56.610 --> 00:09:00.920
So, they can predict what the state
of your health will be based on

174
00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:01.750
available data.

175
00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:03.920
So for instance,
say you've got Fitbit, and

176
00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:05.760
Fitbit is recording
data about your health.

177
00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:07.500
How your heart rate and things like this.

178
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:11.320
That data can be used by
an insurance agency to

179
00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:12.500
figure out how much they wanna charge you.

180
00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:15.330
They can say look,
based on your health right now,

181
00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:19.380
we can predict that in a few years, you
might come down with this disease and so

182
00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:21.120
we're gonna charge you more.

183
00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:23.740
So, this type of information is very

184
00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:26.020
useful to different
agencies in different ways.

185
00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:30.780
And you should be aware that while these
IoT devices are beneficial to you,

186
00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:34.328
they are storing data and that data may or
may not be in your control.

187
00:09:34.328 --> 00:09:40.250
Security's another thing.

188
00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:42.940
Often this data is held
in the cloud somewhere.

189
00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:47.440
So say FitBit, it tracks your data,
it sends it to some cloud servers.

190
00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:51.300
Now, this is medical information and
you would like it to remain private.

191
00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:55.720
And they maybe try to keep it private,
but there are hackers.

192
00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:59.520
There are people who steal data, and you
must have heard about this in the news.

193
00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:03.280
And so, the data can be attacked
at the cloud server, and

194
00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:04.535
it's out of your control.

195
00:10:04.535 --> 00:10:06.970
So if that data isn't
maintained in a secure way.

196
00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:09.520
So, what we're showing
over here is basically

197
00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:12.120
a rough picture of
an encryption algorithm.

198
00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:15.060
But the idea is that data
would need to be encrypted.

199
00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:15.970
If it's private data,

200
00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:19.410
health data, you'd like that to
be encrypted on the cloud server.

201
00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:24.925
But you as a user don't have any control,
direct control over

202
00:10:24.925 --> 00:10:29.525
whether encryption is being used, or
maybe it's not being used consistently.

203
00:10:29.525 --> 00:10:31.135
You can't control that directly, right?

204
00:10:31.135 --> 00:10:32.675
That's up to the cloud server.

205
00:10:32.675 --> 00:10:35.935
So you are left to trust them
to take care of your data, and

206
00:10:35.935 --> 00:10:37.615
often these agencies are not trustworthy.

207
00:10:37.615 --> 00:10:42.340
I don't want to name names, but
if you've heard about any hacks about

208
00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:45.330
particular companies having
their databases stolen.

209
00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:50.820
And it's happened many times over the last
few months or the last few years,

210
00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:56.010
that data isn't being held in a secure
way and then your private data's stolen.

211
00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:56.886
So this can happen.

212
00:10:56.886 --> 00:10:59.657
Thank you.

213
00:10:59.657 --> 00:11:05.846
