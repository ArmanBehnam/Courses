2
00:00:16.221 --> 00:00:19.378
Internet of Things is a pretty
popular buzzword right now.

3
00:00:19.378 --> 00:00:21.700
But it's not one of those passing fads.

4
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.220
Internet of Things is actually
an important concept that's

5
00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.630
making changes to society right now.

6
00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.252
So, welcome to Module One, and

7
00:00:28.252 --> 00:00:31.685
we'll be talking about Internet
of Things over the entire course.

8
00:00:31.685 --> 00:00:35.190
But in this module we'll
basically define the term.

9
00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.030
It's used in many different ways
depending on the speaker and

10
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.130
their motivations and so on.

11
00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:44.808
But we'll break down the term,
talk about it, give some examples.

12
00:00:44.808 --> 00:00:48.274
So you get some kind of an intuitive
understanding of what an Internet of

13
00:00:48.274 --> 00:00:50.140
Things device is, and what it is not.

14
00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:55.310
Also, we'll talk about various trends,
technology trends that lead to Internet of

15
00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:59.220
Things, that allow it, that enable it
effectively, and make it all possible.

16
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.180
And, we'll talk a little bit
about the impact on society.

17
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.700
Of having things embedded in everywhere
that are watching you at all times and

18
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.020
are networked.

19
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.788

issues and things like that.
