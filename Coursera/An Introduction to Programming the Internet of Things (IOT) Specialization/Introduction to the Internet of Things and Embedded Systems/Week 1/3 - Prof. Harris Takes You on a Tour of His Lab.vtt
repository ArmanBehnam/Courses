2
00:00:14.731 --> 00:00:15.862
So now, it's the lab tour.

3
00:00:15.862 --> 00:00:16.951
So, here's my lab.

4
00:00:16.951 --> 00:00:18.402
I got a bunch of equipment here.

5
00:00:18.402 --> 00:00:20.430
Let's start off with these computers.

6
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.780
These are sort of old and
semi-defunked computers.

7
00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.710
These computers are actually for
my computer security research.

8
00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.730
I actually have a group of students,
who wanna do, look at attacking networks.

9
00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.690
Look at attacking computer networks, and
so I'm gonna have them work on this.

10
00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.160
This will be a network.

11
00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.270
And they will attack it, and try to
defend it, and see if they can do that.

12
00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:41.450
So that's what those are for.

13
00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:42.270
This is just a computer.

14
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.387
Over here, we have some of the stuff
that I use for hardware design.

15
00:00:48.387 --> 00:00:50.736
So I've got, let's see, a soldering iron.

16
00:00:50.736 --> 00:00:51.420
Let's start with that.

17
00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.400
Soldering iron is used to solder
together pieces of metal,

18
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.210
when we're building a system, and
this is a cleaner for the iron.

19
00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.860
[SOUND] I've got my oscilloscope.

20
00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.282
An oscilloscope is a diagnostic tool.

21
00:01:05.282 --> 00:01:08.190
It is used to tell you the value of
certain signals, certain wave forms.

22
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.000
So if you wanna see the voltage of
a signal over time, you connect this up,

23
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.250
and this is the ground, and

24
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.270
you can see the voltage of
the signal over time on this screen.

25
00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:18.695
So, I use that a lot.

26
00:01:18.695 --> 00:01:19.650
I got a multimeter.

27
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.307
I use this even more.

28
00:01:21.307 --> 00:01:25.880
Multimeter is basically just
a device that has two probes, and

29
00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:32.450
it allows you to see the voltage current
and resistance between the two points.

30
00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.446
So you can touch these two probes to
different points in the circuit, and

31
00:01:35.446 --> 00:01:36.734
see the voltage between them.

32
00:01:36.734 --> 00:01:40.153
[SOUND] I got a microscope.

33
00:01:40.153 --> 00:01:44.393
This is for working with small devices,
so sometimes I'm looking at small printed

34
00:01:44.393 --> 00:01:47.980
circuit boards,
things that designed area very compactly.

35
00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:52.200
So in order to desolder it, and work with
them properly, I need a magnifying glass,

36
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.160
or even better yet, this is actually
better than a magnifying glass.

37
00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.963
It's got a light on it, to give me
good visualization of the component.

38
00:02:00.963 --> 00:02:08.210
Random parts, solder, and snips,
and desoldering wick, and so on.

39
00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:13.577
This is actually a mixed power supply and
a multimeter, together.

40
00:02:13.577 --> 00:02:15.961
So a control power supply and
multimeter, I don't use it too much, but

41
00:02:15.961 --> 00:02:16.650
it's very useful.

42
00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.200
This is just a crimping tool,
to crimp terminals onto the end of wires.

43
00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:28.174
This right here is a project I'm sort of
working on still, it is a quadcopter, or

44
00:02:28.174 --> 00:02:30.570
a de-funked quadcopter.

45
00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.820
It's got four motors.

46
00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.100
Four actuators.

47
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.350
Four ESCs, electronic speed controls.

48
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:38.710
These control the speed of the motors.

49
00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.350
This is the control of the main
flight controller for it.

50
00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.010
So this flight controller
sends data to these ESCs,

51
00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.250
to indicate what speed
the motor should go at.

52
00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.650
This is the battery right here.

53
00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.489
This is maybe half the weight
of the old device.

54
00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.030
Then over here I have my turntable,
one of my turntables, so

55
00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.940
it's an old dirty turntable,
and it doesn't work right now.

56
00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.660
And since I have a lab,
I feel like why not fix it.

57
00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.330
I need to solder something
together actually this board,

58
00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.795
this is actually what's wrong right here.

59
00:03:07.795 --> 00:03:10.370
[LAUGH] That needs to be resoldered,
[LAUGH] the board is decayed.

60
00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.410
And this is the turntable, the platter
that goes on top of it once it's repaired.

61
00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.856
Over here I just have a box of
a soldering irons and things like that,

62
00:03:19.856 --> 00:03:21.970
tools that I use for my classes.

63
00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.638
So when I have a class, and
I want them to solder, I just

64
00:03:24.638 --> 00:03:28.588
bring this whole box over to the class and
everybody has a component to work with.

65
00:03:28.588 --> 00:03:32.610
So over here, we have lots of
different parts stacked up here.

66
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.297
All kinds of different components,
wires, every wire and

67
00:03:36.297 --> 00:03:39.405
cable that you could probably ever need,
that I have somewhere in here.

68
00:03:39.405 --> 00:03:43.120
Programmers, and
programming micro-controllers, wire.

69
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.970
These are my portable cases, so
when I'm on the run to a class or

70
00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.270
something like that,
I put stuff in this and carry it off.

71
00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.330
Duct tape is always good,
[LAUGH] I always need that.

72
00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.960
What do I have?

73
00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:55.960
More equipment over here.

74
00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:01.066
Piles of resistors, in all sizes and
shapes, and all of that.

75
00:04:01.066 --> 00:04:03.060
Power supplies.

76
00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.934
Here we have Raspberry Pi, so,
[LAUGH] we'll be seeing this in the class,

77
00:04:06.934 --> 00:04:07.690
eventually.

78
00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.600
Let's take a look.

79
00:04:16.584 --> 00:04:18.098
Here we go.

80
00:04:18.098 --> 00:04:22.152
That is a Raspberry Pi Model B.

81
00:04:22.152 --> 00:04:23.970
This is basically what we'll probably be
working with, maybe this is the right way.

82
00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.890
[LAUGH] Yeah, this the right way,
the wording is right up this way.

83
00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:30.990
So this is a Raspberry Pi,
and we'll work with those.

84
00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.425
Also Arduinos, I got those too,
in my Arduino case.

85
00:04:35.425 --> 00:04:37.468
[SOUND] Put that over there.

86
00:04:37.468 --> 00:04:41.510
Here is one, it's not a brand new one,
but they all look the same, pretty much.

87
00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:42.260
That's an Arduino Uno.

88
00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.550
Actually, this is a shield for an Arduino.

89
00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.350
We'll talk about those, too.

90
00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:50.860
It stacks, and notice it has
the same size and configuration.

91
00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:51.780
You can stack it on the top.

92
00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.491
This is an ethernet shield, and
this is an old ethernet shield.

93
00:04:57.491 --> 00:05:01.823
[LAUGH] But if you wanna connect this
to the ethernet, you'll do that.

94
00:05:01.823 --> 00:05:04.861
And Friday components, and that's it.

95
00:05:04.861 --> 00:05:05.630
Thank you.

96
00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:11.269
