2
00:00:10.053 --> 00:00:14.167
So this lecture we'll talk a little bit
about the internet and structure and

3
00:00:14.167 --> 00:00:16.230
we'll get into internet protocols.

4
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.000
Protocols in general.

5
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.560
We'll talk about what
a network protocol is.

6
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.460
We have to know a little bit about these.

7
00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.950
We don't want to go into
detail in protocols.

8
00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.370
But you have to know they exist because
the hardware that we buy when we make our

9
00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:29.200
IOT device,

10
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.060
the hardware that we buy, we'll buy
it matching a particular protocol.

11
00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.850
So we'll pick the protocol and
pick the hardware to match that.

12
00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.780
So we need to know at least the existence
of protocols and what they are.

13
00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:45.730
So, internet structure is ad hoc,
that is, it's very irregular, right?

14
00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.890
People can join the network,
leave the network.

15
00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.670
I can open up a laptop in
this room right now and

16
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.160
suddenly it will be part of the internet,
right, and people can send messages to it.

17
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.360
And then if I shut if off, it is now
temporarily no longer part of the network.

18
00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.280
So, the internet is very dynamic.

19
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.140
Somebody can build up a new network
right now, plug it into the wall, and

20
00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.460
bam, there's a new addition to the
internet, and that happens all the time.

21
00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.110
It has an unpredictable structure,
but it still has to work.

22
00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.650
Actually, it's pretty amazing
that it works as well as it does,

23
00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.130
given the fact that it's so crazy.

24
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.760
So it can be changed by anyone at any
time, so you have to be able to send

25
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.670
messages between this wide
variety of network types, right.

26
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.220
So you've got these LANs that
maybe use different protocols,

27
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.170
routers that are speaking different
protocols, destination LAN,

28
00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:30.170
it speaks a different protocol.

29
00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.040
And so you've got this,

30
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.900
you've got to be able to consistently send
messages regardless of everything else.

31
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:41.880
That means if I set up a host in my
office, I set up a network in my office,

32
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.090
that thing has got to be able to talk to
some LAN on the other side of the world

33
00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.580
without knowing anything about
the protocol of that LAN.

34
00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:50.165
Right?
And

35
00:01:50.165 --> 00:01:52.570
without knowing only minimal about it,
right?

36
00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.120
I don't know what type of protocol
they're gonna use on that LAN.

37
00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.220
All I know is I wanna send a message
to a machine on that LAN, right?

38
00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.340
So you have very little structure, but

39
00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.810
you still have to have some level of
uniformity so that everybody can talk.

40
00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:10.060
So how is it possible to send bits,
bits meaning messages,

41
00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.740
across these networks hop to hop through
these different networks with different

42
00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.360
sort of different protocols essentially.

43
00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.010
So, we'll talk about these protocols,
let's define them.

44
00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.240
Protocols are basically a set of rules,
rules of communication.

45
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.910
If we're talking about for

46
00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.590
network protocols it's a set
of rules of communication.

47
00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.250
And there are a lot of rules.

48
00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.100
But generally, it's a set of rules,

49
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:36.070
hopefully a minimal set of rules, which as
long as everybody adheres to those rules.

50
00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:37.580
Everybody can communicate, okay?

51
00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.600
And you wanna make these rules minimal so

52
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.240
that they're not a burden
on the local area network.

53
00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.040
So you wanna give people who are building
their local area networks as much freedom

54
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.780
as you can as to how they
design their network.

55
00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.550
But there have to be some protocol rules
that they adhere to, some minimal rules

56
00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.670
which will allow them to communicate
with all the other local area networks.

57
00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.060
Through the internet.

58
00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.440
So the internet has protocols
associated with it, which

59
00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.030
if you wanna talk on the internet, your
networks have to support these protocols.

60
00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.500
Now just to give you some intuition
about what a protocol is,

61
00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.850
it's basically something that you add.

62
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.590
It usually involves
adding data to a method.

63
00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.800
Okay, regular type of data to a message.

64
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.530
So if you ever watch old movies,
or cop movies,

65
00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.180
something like that and they're on
the radio, and they say something.

66
00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.640
Something something something over, right.

67
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.810
Over, they say over at the end
of their message right?

68
00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.550
And as soon as they say over,
somebody else can start talking.

69
00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.300
Right?
And then when they're done they just say

70
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.970
over and out, right?

71
00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.070
So this is a protocol.

72
00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.340
Cuz what it says is that every
time you send a message,

73
00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.360
I don't care what the content is,
I don't care what the words are.

74
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.010
Just make sure that at the end of that
message you say the word over, right?

75
00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.910
And no matter what the content
of the entire conversation was,

76
00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.390
just make sure that at the end of that
conversation you say over and out.

77
00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.940
As long as you follow those rules,
everybody can talk.

78
00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.590
Because the goal of those protocols is,
the radio protocols with humans talking on

79
00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.490
radio, is so that two people aren't
talking over each other, right.

80
00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:04.840
You want to make sure that one
person's talking at a time.

81
00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.620
So whoever is talking can keep
talking until they say the word over.

82
00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.410
When they say that, the other person
knows oh, now it's my turn, and

83
00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:12.930
they talk until they say over.

84
00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.440
So over's like passing the baton
to the other person to talk.

85
00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.530
And as long as you adhere to those simple
rules, it doesn't matter what you say,

86
00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.590
what the content is,
you can talk with somebody else.

87
00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:26.770
Now there are limits to that, right,

88
00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.220
because there's no rule about how long
you can talk before you say, over.

89
00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.220
So you could just talk all day and
then finally say, over, and

90
00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.480
then you would be a bottleneck to
the network and that would be a problem.

91
00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.520
So internet access has rules
to handle that, right.

92
00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.140
There are time limits and
things like this.

93
00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:41.050
But you get the idea.

94
00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.080
A protocol is basically extra data that
you add, is represented by extra data

95
00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.160
you add to the message, like the word
over or the word over and out.

96
00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.065
Right.

97
00:04:49.065 --> 00:04:52.195
There all kinds of rules that
extra data that you put in there

98
00:04:52.195 --> 00:04:54.875
that are used to enable communication.

99
00:04:54.875 --> 00:04:59.165
So we call those, that a protocol, that's
a set of rules that enables communication

100
00:04:59.165 --> 00:05:01.065
which minimally constrains the message.

101
00:05:01.065 --> 00:05:03.685
It adds a little bit of data
to the message typically.

102
00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.545
That's what a protocol is, and

103
00:05:06.545 --> 00:05:12.110
TCP/IP is the most common set
of protocols for internet.

104
00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:16.220
In fact specifically IP stands for
Internet Protocol and

105
00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.880
if you're using the internet, if you want
your machine to talk on the internet,

106
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.840
they have to use Internet Protocol.

107
00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:22.962
They have to adhere to the rules of IP.

108
00:05:22.962 --> 00:05:28.205
Now TCP/IP TCP is another protocol and
that protocol is,

109
00:05:28.205 --> 00:05:33.010
it also is used in conjunction
with the internet.

110
00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:36.210
So if you use the internet you're
either using TCP or UDP, right?

111
00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:38.640
And you're using IP.

112
00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:43.060
So I said TCP/IP it could also be UCP,
UDP/IP.

113
00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.180
A Universal Datagram Packet, if I recall.

114
00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:46.370
Protocol, sorry.

115
00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:47.010
And IP.

116
00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:49.770
You put those together and
that's internet.

117
00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.000
So you can do anything else you want,

118
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.710
you can add all kinds of
other data into the message.

119
00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:57.776
As long as you adhere to those protocols,
you can talk on the internet and

120
00:05:57.776 --> 00:06:00.706
your machines can communicate with
other machines on the internet.

121
00:06:00.706 --> 00:06:02.058
Thank you.

122
00:06:02.058 --> 00:06:10.519
