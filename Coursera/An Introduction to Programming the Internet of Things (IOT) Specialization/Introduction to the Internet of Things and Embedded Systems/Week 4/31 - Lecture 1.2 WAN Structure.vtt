2
00:00:10.105 --> 00:00:13.747
The internet is a wide area network,
the wide area network, and

3
00:00:13.747 --> 00:00:18.138
that's generally the network that we
want to communicate with eventually.

4
00:00:18.138 --> 00:00:22.920
So we're going to talk about the general
structure of a wide-area network.

5
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.540
These pictures are pretty high level,
but they give you the general picture

6
00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:30.050
of what a wide-area network like the
Internet would be, how it's composed, and

7
00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.626
what the different
components are inside there.

8
00:00:31.626 --> 00:00:36.040
So a wide-area network, like the Internet,

9
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.620
is a network,
it's a combination of local area networks.

10
00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.300
So if you think about the Internet,
it's very ad-hoc.

11
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.420
There's no regularity, meaning like
right now, if I wanted to, I could build

12
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.480
a network right here in this building,
and it would be added to the Internet.

13
00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.600
I could give it a name, and
it would be part of the Internet.

14
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.145
And so the Internet isn't one of
these networks that's controlled and

15
00:00:58.145 --> 00:00:59.600
well-structured.

16
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.810
Unlike the local area networks that
you see at your place of work,

17
00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:04.964
or at a school, where you have some I.T.

18
00:01:04.964 --> 00:01:08.460
department, I.T. group, and they
constrain how the thing is put in there.

19
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.640
They say, look,
every time a machine comes in here,

20
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.050
you've got to register it this way.

21
00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.250
We only approve of this and that.

22
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.580
And they put the equipment into
the building for you, and all that.

23
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:17.940
So it's very structured.

24
00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.500
But, generally, wide area,
the internet specifically,

25
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.650
is pretty unstructured, right?

26
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.450
There is some minimal structure, there
has to be, but it's fairly unstructured.

27
00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.540
So at a low level, at the leaf level,
local area network level, there can be

28
00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.350
any number of different local area
network types involved in the internet,

29
00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.600
just depending on what
people want locally.

30
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.360
So you start off with local area networks.

31
00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.910
You've got our local area network and

32
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.192
you've got several hosts,
Host one, two, three, and

33
00:01:44.192 --> 00:01:47.180
these hosts suggest confrontational
devices that on the network.

34
00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.010
So basically computers or IOT devices.

35
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.650
And they are all communicating
with a component.

36
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.680
Now in this picture we have a switch.

37
00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.120
It could be hub or a switch.

38
00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:03.280
A hub is a network component
that has several input ports.

39
00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.550
We're assuming wired right now.

40
00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.840
This can also be all done wirelessly,
but let's talk wired for a minute.

41
00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.540
It's got several input ports,
input-output ports, like in this case,

42
00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:12.130
this switch has three ports, right?

43
00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.960
So you could have a hub
there that has three.

44
00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:19.840
And any time a packet is sent on
one of the ports it is reflected,

45
00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.470
copied to the other ports.

46
00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.170
So if host one sends a message to anybody,

47
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.585
that same message is spit
out to codes two and three.

48
00:02:27.585 --> 00:02:28.995
So both of them get the message.

49
00:02:28.995 --> 00:02:30.505
That's what a hub does.

50
00:02:30.505 --> 00:02:32.185
A switch is more intelligent.

51
00:02:32.185 --> 00:02:36.435
A switch says look, it looks at the packet
header to see where it's going.

52
00:02:36.435 --> 00:02:41.085
So if host one sends a message to
the switch and it looks at the destination

53
00:02:41.085 --> 00:02:45.635
message is host three, then the switch
there is smart enough to know

54
00:02:45.635 --> 00:02:49.200
that that message should only be
send to host three not to host two.

55
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.040
So the switch is more intelligent
about where it sends messages to,

56
00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.230
where a host is more dumb.

57
00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.720
But you got a host or switch somewhere
in there that transmits data

58
00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.650
between the different input ports and
output ports.

59
00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.190
So generally, LANs look like this.

60
00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.360
Now, you can have larger LANs,
which involve multiple protocols.

61
00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.810
So you see on the left you've got a LAN,

62
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.960
on the right you've got a LAN,
you can combine them with a bridge.

63
00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.230
The bridge can communicate
different LAN protocols.

64
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.070
So maybe you got these LANs and one group,

65
00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.000
one department in the University decides
they want to use this particular protocol,

66
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.610
another department uses another
particular protocol, but

67
00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.080
they want their machines to communicate so
they put a bridge in between.

68
00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.760
And the bridge basically
talks both protocols and

69
00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.650
can do conversions between the two.

70
00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:41.260
So you can group together these LANs into
larger LAN components, let's call them.

71
00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.500
It's not a single LAN any more,

72
00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.950
you can have multiple protocols that
are glued together by this bridge.

73
00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.830
Now, a wide area network is a set of these
LAN's all put together with routers.

74
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.320
So if you look at this network, this is by
the way is a vastly simplified internet.

75
00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.710
But you got a bunch of LAN's, and
they are all communicating to routers.

76
00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:02.800
And then the routers can communicate
with each other to pass data.

77
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.890
So, one LAN can communicate
with a completely different LAN

78
00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:07.240
through these routers.

79
00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.860
So you notice every message is sent
from one machine to another has to,

80
00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.510
has many hops, what are called hops.

81
00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.130
Has to go through several different
machines before it reaches

82
00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.810
Is the destination.

83
00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.550
So if you want to go from one LAN to
another, you might leave this LAN and

84
00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:21.400
go to this router, and then go to
another router and another router and

85
00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.220
then finally back to the destination
LAN and then to the host.

86
00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.800
So there is a sequence of hops,
it is called routes,

87
00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.300
actually, of hops that you have to go
through to reach your destination.

88
00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.530
And so with these routers,
they are organized.

89
00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.630
This is very simple, it's only three,
but and realities a vast hierarchy of

90
00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:40.620
these routers and they have intelligent
protocols that determine where they should

91
00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:45.896
send the packet next to reach its
destination most quickly and avoid flow.

92
00:04:45.896 --> 00:04:48.440
You don't want to have one router
that receives too much data,

93
00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.380
maybe all the messages are running through
one router, you'd like to spread out that

94
00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.230
data across the entire network, so that
the one router doesn't get bogged down.

95
00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:58.089
So there are lots of protocols
along those lines, and

96
00:04:58.089 --> 00:05:01.786
the internet involves protocols
like that to level out the traffic.

97
00:05:01.786 --> 00:05:02.442
Thank you.

98
00:05:02.442 --> 00:05:10.849
