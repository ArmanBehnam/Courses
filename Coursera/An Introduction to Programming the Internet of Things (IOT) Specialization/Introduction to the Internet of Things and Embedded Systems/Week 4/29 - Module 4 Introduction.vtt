2
00:00:15.995 --> 00:00:19.438
So networking is clearly an important
part of internet of things,

3
00:00:19.438 --> 00:00:21.350
internet is right there in the name.

4
00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.560
So in module four we'll talk
about networking in general.

5
00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.320
We'll talk about networks, network
protocols, we'll focus on the internet

6
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.230
because that's the network to which
we'll most likely be connecting.

7
00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.298
Also we'll talk more specifically
about mobile ad hoc networks.

8
00:00:37.298 --> 00:00:42.600
Mobile ad hoc networks are magnets,
sre smaller networks of mobile devices,

9
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.100
which IOT devices commonly are,
and they're ad hoc,

10
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.820
meaning they're changing all the time.

11
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.430
Things move in them,
things move out of them,

12
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.300
and that's inevitable when
your using mobile devices.

13
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.760
The configuration network
can change very dynamically.

14
00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.393
So we'll talk about magnets, and
how there are different protocols used for

15
00:01:00.393 --> 00:01:02.318
magnets, and how you design and

16
00:01:02.318 --> 00:01:05.966
implement an interface component
with networking in mind.

17
00:01:05.966 --> 00:01:09.678
