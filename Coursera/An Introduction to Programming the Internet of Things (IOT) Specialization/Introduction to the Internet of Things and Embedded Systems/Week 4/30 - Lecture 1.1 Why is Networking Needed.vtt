2
00:00:09.832 --> 00:00:12.770
In this lecture,
we'll talk a little bit about networking.

3
00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:15.149
Networking is a central
feature of Internet of Things.

4
00:00:15.149 --> 00:00:18.434
We'll talk about why it's needed,
how it's helpful.

5
00:00:18.434 --> 00:00:22.658
Also we'll start talking about
general structure of networks,

6
00:00:22.658 --> 00:00:25.430
sort of the broad categories of networks.

7
00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:28.600
Why is networking needed?

8
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.850
Well, it enhances devices.

9
00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:33.040
It makes things better, let's say.

10
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.240
So it enhances features
by giving you access

11
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.780
to computational complexity
outside of the local device.

12
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.040
So if the Internet of Things
device is a camera or a phone or

13
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.870
a car or whatever it is, the fact that
it's connected on a larger network

14
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.928
means that from that smaller device,
you can access much more powerful servers,

15
00:00:53.928 --> 00:00:57.810
much bigger databases.

16
00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:01.030
You can access all that through
whatever the device is.

17
00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.570
And having access to all
this computational power and

18
00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.660
all this data can it be used,

19
00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.300
can it be leveraged to enhance a lot
of devices and improve their features.

20
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:15.110
So for instance cars, let's say cars
an Internet of Things things device.

21
00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.830
If they can communicate with each other
on a network to improve traffic flow.

22
00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.420
So wouldn't that be great if cars
were all talking on a network and

23
00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:23.890
they could plan their own routes, and

24
00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.920
consider the fact that other cars
were planning their own routes.

25
00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.290
They could collaborate together
to make the flow fast.

26
00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.680
Which by the way is possible and
probably will happen in a decade or so,

27
00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.690
but it takes a while to get
those things worked out.

28
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.050
But, that's probably going to happen,

29
00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.830
there's no reason why that can't
happen and that would be very useful.

30
00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:46.060
So, it's an example where you're enhancing
the feature of a car by using the network.

31
00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.040
And so they can now talk to each other,
they can talk to a centralized database

32
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.889
and get mapping information and
things like this.

33
00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.170
Online game play,
we all know about that, or I do.

34
00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.200
So, there are a lot of games,
in fact there is a large segment of games

35
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.950
where you can't,
there isn't much to play by yourself.

36
00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.130
You have to play online, right?

37
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.350
Call of Duty for example,
or Destiny or whatever.

38
00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.360
Those games, you play them online and
it opens up a whole new world to you,

39
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.110
literally right?

40
00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.760
Many new worlds.

41
00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.370
You can connect to different people And

42
00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.940
do all sorts of extra things that you
couldn't do locally on one machine.

43
00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.380
Accessing media libraries.

44
00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:21.860
Netflix for instance, right?

45
00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.110
Or Amazon instant player.

46
00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.980
Whatever library you're using.

47
00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.650
You can only access those.

48
00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.900
Maybe you're using a TV,
as your Internet of Things device.

49
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.920
But it alone doesn't have the library
of all movies ever created, right?

50
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.230
You have to connect through the network
to Netflix database, or whoever it is.

51
00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.298
So networking is useful,

52
00:02:39.298 --> 00:02:43.360
it's very useful, it enhances
abilities of any particular device.

53
00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.254
Now, the communication between
an Internet of Things device and

54
00:02:47.254 --> 00:02:50.014
the main network is usually,
most commonly,

55
00:02:50.014 --> 00:02:54.230
follows a client-server model
that we're showing here.

56
00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.061
So, the client would be
the Internet of Things device.

57
00:02:57.061 --> 00:03:00.330
That's a smaller machine,relatively
less powerful machine,

58
00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.180
connected to some server and

59
00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.890
you see that in the middle of the server
it is guarding, protecting some resource.

60
00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.950
Giving access let's say to a resource.

61
00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.910
So you see the resource
over there on the side.

62
00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.000
The resource can be any kind of resource,
maybe it's a web server.

63
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.270
And the data for the web pages is in
that resource or something like that.

64
00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.930
Then the server gives
access to that resource.

65
00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.680
So the client which might be
the Internet of Things device,

66
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.430
that thing is communicating,
making requests of,

67
00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.390
the server to get whatever
the appropriate information is.

68
00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.150
The server then manages the resource.

69
00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.800
So it handles the request,

70
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.550
gets whatever it is that is needed from
the resource, and sends it back in

71
00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.950
the form of a response to the client which
will be your Internet of Things device.

72
00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.820
And maybe you see the web page or you have
whatever data you were looking for or

73
00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.998
you get the movie that you wanted to
look for, or something like that.

74
00:03:46.998 --> 00:03:50.780
So this client-server
model is very common.

75
00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.710
The client is generally less powerful.

76
00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:56.790
That is, it's a smaller machine,
literally less power.

77
00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:57.930
It's slower.

78
00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.320
Where the server can be a very large,
cloud-based server, very powerful,

79
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.030
plugged directly into the wall, has lots
of power, cooling fans, whatever it has.

80
00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.840
So, and the resource can be whatever
you want, a bank of disk drives and

81
00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.860
some machines, whatever you want.

82
00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.380
So this is typically the model that
you see Internet of Things devices

83
00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.940
communicating with the network through.

84
00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.380
So, we're gonna talk about three really
broad classes of networks right now.

85
00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.440
First, a LAN,
local area network, stands for.

86
00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.240
And a local area network is just
a relatively small network.

87
00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.390
Usually spans a building, a campus,

88
00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:35.065
a campus might have just one local area
network, a floor of your building.

89
00:04:35.065 --> 00:04:37.645
You've had experience with
local area networks I'm sure.

90
00:04:37.645 --> 00:04:40.795
And typically the way you access these
networks is either through the wall,

91
00:04:40.795 --> 00:04:43.952
through a wall socket,
an ethernet jack in the wall.

92
00:04:43.952 --> 00:04:45.462
I see one right here.

93
00:04:45.462 --> 00:04:47.602
Also Wi-Fi routers.

94
00:04:47.602 --> 00:04:49.002
I see one in here too right.

95
00:04:49.002 --> 00:04:50.842
So we're familiar with those.

96
00:04:50.842 --> 00:04:55.700
Local area network is commonly for
a building or something relatively small.

97
00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:00.330
Now, on the other side of that, there is
a wide area network, the other extreme.

98
00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.420
Wide area network, the best example
of that is the Internet itself.

99
00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:05.500
That's an extremely wide area network.

100
00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.800
And a wide area network is just a lot
more complex than a local area network.

101
00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.560
There is a hierarchy of machines
that are communicating together.

102
00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.390
So it's really, a wide area network
is really a different class of

103
00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:20.940
network than a local area network,
has different protocols involved.

104
00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.919
And Internet is basically the wide area
network that we'll be talking about.

105
00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:29.320
Now in addition to this we have
Mobile Ad Hoc Networks MANET.

106
00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.580
These are actually important to
Internet of Things components because

107
00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:35.809
Mobile Ad Hoc Networks are, they're
composed of largely mobile devices.

108
00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.250
Thus the term mobile.

109
00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.100
And a lot of Internet of
Things devices are mobile.

110
00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:46.030
And it's an ad hoc network because
it reconfigures itself constantly.

111
00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.950
So that is maybe an Internet
of Things device of

112
00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:52.420
cell phones let's say comes into range of
the network then it joins the network.

113
00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:54.710
But you continue walking and
you walk another block and

114
00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:56.190
you're outside of the network.

115
00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:58.670
So the network is reconfiguring
every few seconds,

116
00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:00.370
maybe something is
walking into the network.

117
00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:03.030
Something's moving out of the network,
it's very dynamic.

118
00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:04.540
So that's what a MANET is.

119
00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:06.420
And a lot of Internet of Things devices,

120
00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:08.720
are part of a network like that,
of a MANET.

121
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.430
And you need different protocols for that,

122
00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:15.070
you have to assume some of the things are
mobiles, so power is a constraint, right?

123
00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:17.930
Cuz usually you're
battery-driven if you're mobile.

124
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:21.188
So they have a different class of
algorithms for MANETS as well.

125
00:06:21.188 --> 00:06:22.174
Thank you.

126
