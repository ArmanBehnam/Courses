2
00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.733
So, we've been talking about networking.

3
00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:21.512
And we've been talking about the different
components that you find inside networks.

4
00:00:21.512 --> 00:00:25.488
So I thought that since I had some of
these components lying around the lab,

5
00:00:25.488 --> 00:00:27.064
I'd show you some of these and

6
00:00:27.064 --> 00:00:31.040
let you get a look at what they
actually look like in the flesh.

7
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.920
So first is the hub.

8
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.860
This is an ethernet hub.

9
00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.100
These are hard to find.

10
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.660
They don't make many of these anymore,
but this is a hub.

11
00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.530
This is a four port hub.

12
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:40.780
It's got four ethernet jacks.

13
00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.540
You can plug four things in.

14
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.250
And it's very simple what a hub does.

15
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.470
It receives a packet on one port and

16
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.680
it just copies that out
to the other three ports.

17
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.310
So it's just a repeater in that sense.

18
00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:52.570
It's very dumb.

19
00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.160
And it's wasteful in terms of bandwidth,
right.

20
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.810
Because if you're sending a message to,
sending a message from one,

21
00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:59.230
from this port to this port.

22
00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.800
It doesn't need to appear on these
two ports, but it does anyway.

23
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.630
So, there's extra traffic with a hub.

24
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.310
A hub is very dumb and
wasteful in terms of bandwidth.

25
00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:07.740
That's why you don't see
them too much anymore.

26
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.370
So that's the hub.

27
00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:11.560
Next up is a switch.

28
00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.240
This is a switch,
it's a bigger switch than that hub.

29
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.970
This switch has sixteen ports,
instead of four that you saw in that hub,

30
00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.190
but you know the number
of ports is variable.

31
00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.150
But this is smarter so what it does is it
receives packets on, let's say it receives

32
00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.390
a packet on this port, it doesn't just
send it out blindly to every other port.

33
00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:35.670
Instead it learns over time which ports
are connected to which IP addresses.

34
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.480
So it can look at the packet header, and

35
00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.050
determine which port it expects
to see the destination on, and

36
00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:46.520
only send that message on that port, so
if it receives something on this port,

37
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.890
and looks to the header and says,
oh, that device is on port ten,

38
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.510
then it'll only send it out on this
port and that saves bandwidth.

39
00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.150
So that's a switch.

40
00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:57.580
This is a router.

41
00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.870
This is actually a wireless router,
wi-fi router.

42
00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.420
And it's got some lights on the front.

43
00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.740
You've seen these,
you probably have one at home, or

44
00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.830
you've seen them on the wall in your
office building or something like that.

45
00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.240
This is a router.

46
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.160
On the back, it's got an antennae,
since it's a wireless router.

47
00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.960
On the back, again,
it's got ethernet ports.

48
00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.350
[LAUGH] It's the same as the switch and
the hub.

49
00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.980
One thing to notice about these three
devices is that they are very similar.

50
00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.020
I mean their interfaces are similar.

51
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:30.745
They're just a bunch of Ethernet jacks and
some lights.

52
00:02:30.745 --> 00:02:31.810
Ethernet jacks and some lights.

53
00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.250
This one, Ethernet jacks and some lights.

54
00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.449
Now, this also has a wireless antennae
because it's a wireless device, but,

55
00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:43.714
generally these look basically the same
and they only differ in how they function

56
00:02:43.714 --> 00:02:47.556
and how they respond to the messages and
where they reflect messages to.

57
00:02:47.556 --> 00:02:54.189
