2
00:00:09.763 --> 00:00:12.870
We've been talking about capturing
packets on the network interface.

3
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.280
I've mentioned it before and
now we're gonna just try a little bit,

4
00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.910
let you see how to do it.

5
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.440
Actually that will be one of the
assignments too, you can give it a try.

6
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.350
So we'll start out by starting
the WireShark application,

7
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.920
which is gonna be our packet capture tool.

8
00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:31.990
So WireShark,
I have the icon down here on the bottom.

9
00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:33.380
It's this shark fin one.

10
00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:34.050
So I'll start that.

11
00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.660
So network packet protocol analyzer.

12
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.000
So if we look at WireShark, let's pull it
up a little bit, first thing it does is,

13
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.500
right on the front screen,
it gives me a list of devices.

14
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.840
Interface list here.

15
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.060
Let's click on interface
list to see the interfaces.

16
00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.985
Now right here's listing four interfaces.

17
00:00:53.985 --> 00:00:57.030
Four different rows in this
little window that's popped up.

18
00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.590
Now each one of these interfaces is
a network interface they can capture on

19
00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.350
Bluetooth, wi-fi,
wired ethernet and so on.

20
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.530
It's a little bit hard to tell
which one's the right one,

21
00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.120
but I already know that it's the bottom
one, mostly because the number of packets.

22
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.430
Notice that it's already catching
a few packets on that interface and

23
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.150
the other ones are basically dead.

24
00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:20.570
So I will click that interface.

25
00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:21.610
Just like that.

26
00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.380
Now, notice the start button.

27
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.560
When I select start,
it will start capturing.

28
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.560
So I'll hit start, and
WireShark should start capturing packets.

29
00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.650
Now notice that WireShark
is blank at the moment.

30
00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.900
That's because there are no packets,
right now, at this moment.

31
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.450
On this interface.

32
00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.520
There go a few,
okay it's noticing a little bit of noise.

33
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.440
But what I'll do is, hm I'm curious what
those are but I'll look at those later.

34
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.100
So right now.

35
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.660
I see that they are, one's a ARP.

36
00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.420
So what I'll do now is I'll force
some packets under the interface.

37
00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.810
What I'll do is I'll start my web browser.

38
00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.320
So that my web browser
can talk to a web server.

39
00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.150
And then this will record the packets
that are transferred back and forth.

40
00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:08.775
So let's start my browser.

41
00:02:08.775 --> 00:02:10.030
Mozilla Firefox.

42
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.200
Okay, now as it's starting, let's just
move it outta the way for a second.

43
00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:23.080
Yeah, see in the background here, we've
got WireShark capturing lots of packets.

44
00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.450
So I'm gonna tell it to stop,
we've captured enough.

45
00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.150
Click on capture.

46
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.790
Stop right here.

47
00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.290
Okay now it's stopped.

48
00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.030
So we've already gotten over 3,600 packets
just in that short amount of time.

49
00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.150
Now, notice that what's showing here in
the main window, it shows one row for

50
00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.190
every packet that it captured.

51
00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.130
And it's just a one row summary,
it's not the whole message.

52
00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.920
We can select each one and
look at it in more detail.

53
00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.620
We'll do that in a second.

54
00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.910
So first let me sort these
according to protocol.

55
00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.620
There's this column here, protocol, and
you can see a lot of these messages RTCP,

56
00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.060
which is an internet protocol.

57
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.550
Also, you've got HTTP.

58
00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:03.980
Which is web traffic.

59
00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.030
So, let's click on protocol and
sort according to protocol.

60
00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:13.860
Now, DNS domain name service,
ARP address resolution protocol and so on.

61
00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.660
So, lot's of different
protocols being used.

62
00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.690
We're going to go straight
to the HTTP messages.

63
00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.230
So let me just scroll down to HTTP.

64
00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:28.280
So if you remember,
HTTP is basically world wide web.

65
00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.200
So let's take a look at
the first HTTP message,

66
00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.890
that's this one right here,
so I select it.

67
00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.910
So I've highlighted that line.

68
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.310
And the window below, it gives me more
information about that particular packet.

69
00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.420
Actually if we look all the way
to the bottom window down here,

70
00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.480
you'll see basically Hex.

71
00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.280
What's called a Hex dump.

72
00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.000
Hex digits 001907D4 and so on.

73
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.420
So it's digits and letters A through F.

74
00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.360
This is the representation of the message
in hexadecimal, so just the bare zeros and

75
00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.100
ones represented in hexadecimal.

76
00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.790
It's showing me that, which I'm not too
interested in looking at right now, but

77
00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.380
sometimes you want to
look at the bare hex.

78
00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.850
Now, above that, over in this window, it
basically has taken this hexadecimal and

79
00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.280
broken it down into fields
according to the protocol.

80
00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:20.120
So, if we look here, notice here in light
blue, it says Hypertext Transfer Protocol.

81
00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.450
So I'll click the plus sign next to that,
and what it does is,

82
00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.630
it says look, I'll scroll down
a little bit so we can see.

83
00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.270
What it does is it realizes that
this is an HTTP protocol packet, and

84
00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:36.860
so, given that it's in that protocol,
it knows the format of the message.

85
00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.750
So, it knows this first piece of
information should be the get,

86
00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.120
then the next one should
be the next header.

87
00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.910
Next should be the next.

88
00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.330
So it organizes it in that way so
I can read it.

89
00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.510
So the first one we see here is the get.

90
00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:52.830
GetHTTP141.

91
00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.800
That's just the get
requesting the webpage.

92
00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.580
Get slash, so it's just selecting

93
00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.310
whatever webpage is available
there at the top level directory.

94
00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.390
And its giving you the protocol number,

95
00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:08.293
this is how any kind of a get message
starts is with a generic line like that.

96
00:05:08.293 --> 00:05:09.780
So it's requesting a website.

97
00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.930
And that's what happens when you
start up a web browser it goes

98
00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.290
to its default website and
that's what its doing.

99
00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:19.480
And then you can look at
the line below it host/..org,

100
00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.990
and that's because my
default website is /..org.

101
00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:28.640
So the first thing it did was it went
to /..org, requested the web page.

102
00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.030
And line after line,
if we scroll down a little bit,

103
00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.240
we can see more headers,
user agent, accept.

104
00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:39.200
So you can see I'm using Mozilla,
you can see what version and so on.

105
00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.970
You can see all the information
inside the packet.

106
00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:46.320
So, that is Packet Capture for you.

107
00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:50.060
And you can store it and
do all kinds of nice things.

108
00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:53.211
To look at lots of details about each
packet if you're interested in that,

109
00:05:53.211 --> 00:05:53.720
thank you.

110
00:05:53.720 --> 00:06:02.719
