[MUSIC]

2
00:00:09.399 --> 00:00:12.532
So in this lecture,
we'll discuss some of the basic equipment

3
00:00:12.532 --> 00:00:16.863
that you're going to be using when you're
building your internet of things devices.

4
00:00:16.863 --> 00:00:20.589
And some of the basic equipment that we'll
be talking about through the class we'll

5
00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:24.410
assume that you're using just to make
things a little more concrete so you see.

6
00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.390
I've been more generic
in the earlier lectures

7
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.390
about the general type of equipment,
but now we'll actually

8
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.820
point to the specific things that
we're going to cover in this class.

9
00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.630
Then when you do the capstone you'll be
using this type of equipment when you do

10
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:37.210
your capstone.

11
00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:44.260
So first, the main thing we're gonna use
is a development board of some kind.

12
00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.890
It's a board that has
a microcontroller on it,

13
00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.860
which is, of course,
the center of all these projects.

14
00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.110
The center of these systems is gonna
be some microcontroller with some

15
00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:54.540
code running on it.

16
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.110
So, the picture that we have here,
is actually an arduino board.

17
00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.770
And that black chip on the board,
is actually the microcontroller itself.

18
00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.390
Now, there's other hardware on the board.

19
00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.775
There are interfaces like, for instance,
you can see USB interface on the side.

20
00:01:08.775 --> 00:01:11.325
There are a bunch of holes on
the side that you can't see yet,

21
00:01:11.325 --> 00:01:14.075
but those are plugs we're
going to plug wires into.

22
00:01:14.075 --> 00:01:15.785
We'll do that later.

23
00:01:15.785 --> 00:01:17.035
There's a power.

24
00:01:17.035 --> 00:01:19.875
And often there are other
interfaces on the board.

25
00:01:19.875 --> 00:01:21.555
So there are other
interfaces on the board.

26
00:01:21.555 --> 00:01:24.515
There are also the chips on the board and
other devices on the board.

27
00:01:24.515 --> 00:01:26.153
So there's the microcontroller, but

28
00:01:26.153 --> 00:01:29.060
there are other things that
are used on the board.

29
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.660
Generally the board,
those development boards, what they are,

30
00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:36.130
for the most part, the main thing they
have to have is a microcontroller, that

31
00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.110
you're gonna program, but also hardware on
the board to program the microcontroller.

32
00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.640
So basically, data has to get taken from
the USB cable typically, so this has a USB

33
00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.380
port, has to get taken from the USB cable,
which is connected to your host.

34
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.220
Has to get taken from the USB and
programmed into the flash memory of

35
00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.510
the microcontroller, when you want to
put a program onto the microcontroller.

36
00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.280
So, typically these boards are minimally
they will have equipment on there,

37
00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.630
hardware on the board who's job
it is to read the USB cable and

38
00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.040
take the data that is received on there
and program it onto the microcontroller.

39
00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.600
That's sort of a minimum thing that you're
going to find on these development boards.

40
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.400
A lot of different development
boards have lots of different extra

41
00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.540
equipment in addition to that.

42
00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.230
Maybe you have compasses,
accelerometer, magnetometer.

43
00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.870
All sorts of extra components
you can find on these boards.

44
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.220
Touch sensitive screens, all this stuff.

45
00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.470
But the basic board is just what I've
been talking about right now and

46
00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.470
the boards that we're using,
certainly Arduino is pretty basic.

47
00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.460
It has basically what I just said.

48
00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.070
That's an Arduino right there.

49
00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.620
It has very little else
besides the microcontroller,

50
00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.760
the hardware used to program
the microcontroller, plus the interfaces,

51
00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.860
USB and the pins and stuff like that.

52
00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.440
That's basically all an Arduino has on it.

53
00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.330
Now, we're also going to
use a Raspberry Pie and

54
00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.350
we'll go into that in more detail later.

55
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:52.550
That has more things on it.

56
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.356
That actually has an accelerometer on it.

57
00:02:54.356 --> 00:03:00.060
It has a magnetometer, meaning a compass.

58
00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.480
It has a few other things on it.

59
00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.260
But it's mostly pretty bare.

60
00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.400
It has a processor on it too,
a microcontroller on it, too.

61
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.920
I'll say it's a higher end microcontroller
than what you find on our Arduino.

62
00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.700
But that's the core of the system,
so that's how we're gonna start.

63
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.410
We're gonna take these development boards,
plug them in by USB to our host,

64
00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:24.790
our laptop, desktop.

65
00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.210
Write code on the laptop, desktop.

66
00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:29.280
Program it onto the microcontroller
on the development board.

67
00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.710
Now other equipment you're gonna get.

68
00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:37.200
USB cable, clearly,
just to connect the board up.

69
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.392
Ethernet cable is a common piece of
equipment I dont know if we'll be

70
00:03:40.392 --> 00:03:41.015
using that.

71
00:03:41.015 --> 00:03:44.921
But ethernet is common because a lot
of these boards have ethernet cables,

72
00:03:44.921 --> 00:03:48.399
have ethernet jacks because we
want them to be networked, right?

73
00:03:48.399 --> 00:03:51.560
We're talking about internet of things so
it's common to have an ethernet jack.

74
00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.600
Raspberry Pie does,
standard Arduino does not.

75
00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.410
But it's common that they
have ethernet jacks and

76
00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.100
then you would need an ethernet
cable to connect to that.

77
00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.890
Jumper wires.

78
00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:01.410
So you're going to need a set of wires.

79
00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:06.070
You'll get a set of wires to plug
into the input pins of the board.

80
00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:09.670
So that Arduino we saw on the last slide,
it had several holes.

81
00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.490
You can plug wires into those
holes to connect up other things.

82
00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:14.439
Different inputs.

83
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.390
These are components that we will
commonly use as input components, so

84
00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:21.040
essentially sensors.

85
00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.110
So potentiometer,

86
00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:27.060
potentiometer is a sensor that senses
how much turn, sense of rotation.

87
00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.670
So if you turn something more,
turn to the left, turn to the right,

88
00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:32.800
it changes the resistance
between two signals.

89
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.280
And you can use that as a rotation sensor.

90
00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.910
So if you wanna implement a volume knob or
something like that,

91
00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.270
you can use a potentiometer and
sense how much it's turned.

92
00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.760
Photoresistor, so that's something
that senses the brightness.

93
00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:49.840
So the brightness of the light will change
the resistance on a certain resistor,

94
00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.540
and you can sense that.

95
00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:55.420
A keypad, that's another common component,
just a bunch of buttons put together.

96
00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.360
Buttons, individual buttons,
that's another input and

97
00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.500
common piece of equipment,
and we'll have some of these.

98
00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:06.050
Some of the outputs, LEDs, so
those are light emitting diodes,

99
00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.430
you've seen those little lights that
turn off and on, light emitting diodes.

100
00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:13.010
Resistors, we'll talk about those later,
they don't do much.

101
00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:17.610
They consume power and they change
voltage for us, but simple components.

102
00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:18.795
We're also going to use a breadboard.

103
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.560
Now a breadboard, actually I have
a picture of that on the next slide.

104
00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.010
So breadboards are for wiring.

105
00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:26.580
So we're going to have a bunch
of these components and

106
00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.760
we're going to need to connect
these components together.

107
00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:31.190
So how do we connect them?

108
00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:32.270
Well there are several ways.

109
00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:35.445
One way is to solder things and
we are not going to do that.

110
00:05:35.445 --> 00:05:39.271
Soldering is a more permanent connection
where you take two pieces of wire,

111
00:05:39.271 --> 00:05:42.736
two pieces of metal you wanna connect,
you'd take a hot iron touch it

112
00:05:42.736 --> 00:05:45.544
to the joint,
bring some solder which is softer metal,

113
00:05:45.544 --> 00:05:49.596
you melt it onto the joint and it forms
a seal and it connects them electrically.

114
00:05:49.596 --> 00:05:50.252
So that soldering.

115
00:05:50.252 --> 00:05:53.574
We won't do soldering, because soldering,
well several things, but

116
00:05:53.574 --> 00:05:57.100
the main thing is soldering is more
permanent and we're just prototyping.

117
00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:00.780
I mean, you're gonna be trying things and
trying things again, trying things again.

118
00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:02.400
Making mistakes, trying again.

119
00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.760
So soldering is too time consuming.

120
00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:06.020
Soldering is more permanent.

121
00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:07.980
In the end, when you're done,
you know everything works,

122
00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:09.620
then you might solder things together.

123
00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.390
But we're not in that mode,
we're gonna be using a breadboard.

124
00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:16.950
So breadboard is for non-permanent wiring.

125
00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:19.320
So basically it's got a bunch of holes,
a board with a bunch of holes.

126
00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:23.880
And these holes fit 24 gauge wire,
which is the common wire size for

127
00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:25.700
components like this.

128
00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:28.050
And these holes
are connected electrically.

129
00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:33.150
There are rows of five holes, you can see
there, and if you put a wire into one

130
00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:38.550
hole in a row of five, all the other holes
in the same row of five are connected.

131
00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:41.893
So you can plug two wires into two
different holes on the same row of five

132
00:06:41.893 --> 00:06:43.840
and they are connected.

133
00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.130
And that's how you connect components.

134
00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:49.430
So you can plug one connection from
a component into one hole in the row and

135
00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:52.090
plug another component into
another hole in the same row, and

136
00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:53.860
then those two components are connected.

137
00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:55.170
Okay.
So this is how we're going to be

138
00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:55.800
doing wiring.

139
00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.170
We're gonna have our breadboard and
we connect things in that way.

140
00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:02.290
And if you look at the breadboard,
it's got these rows of five, but

141
00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:05.820
then along the left and right sides,
you got these columns, right.

142
00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:08.990
These two columns on the left, two columns
on the right with breaks in between.

143
00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:11.160
But basically, two on the left,
two on the right.

144
00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.670
So those columns are actually
wired differently.

145
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:16.290
They're not wired horizontally
like those rows of five.

146
00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:17.660
They're wired in columns.

147
00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:21.490
So those two columns on the left, all
holes in the same column are connected to

148
00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:24.290
each other, and all holes in the next
column are connected to each other.

149
00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:25.673
Same thing on the other side.

150
00:07:25.673 --> 00:07:28.890
All holes on the one column and
all holes on the next are connected.

151
00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:32.112
So traditionally those columns
are used for power and

152
00:07:32.112 --> 00:07:36.478
ground because usually when you make
a system, you have a lot of chips and

153
00:07:36.478 --> 00:07:41.202
a lot of different components in there and
a lot of them need to receive power and

154
00:07:41.202 --> 00:07:45.211
need to be connected to ground, so
it helps to distribute power and

155
00:07:45.211 --> 00:07:49.865
ground across the whole circuit to just
put power and ground into those rows,

156
00:07:49.865 --> 00:07:51.810
those columns, rather.

157
00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:53.350
So, put power into one column.

158
00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:54.610
Ground into another.

159
00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:56.310
Then anything you want to
connect to power and ground,

160
00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:57.300
you don't have to run a long wire.

161
00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:01.426
You just run a wire straight to that
column, to the nearest hole on the column.

162
00:08:01.426 --> 00:08:05.094
So, we'll be using breadboards
to connect up our components and

163
00:08:05.094 --> 00:08:08.841
it's very common for prototyping and
it's made a specific size.

164
00:08:08.841 --> 00:08:10.020
It's a common size.

165
00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:13.290
Here's a typical circuit.

166
00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:15.140
This is just one possible circuit but
there's an Arduino.

167
00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:18.680
And this Arduino,
it's connected to some LEDs.

168
00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:22.120
You can see those red LEDs that
are in the breadboard, right.

169
00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:25.890
So the LEDs are plugged into holes
in the breadboard, the two leads.

170
00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:29.830
An LED has two leads, two wires, that
are connected to holes in the breadboard.

171
00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:30.790
They're also resisters.

172
00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:32.260
I don't know if you can see them.

173
00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:36.390
But those little components that
connect from the LEDs to the bottom row

174
00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:37.780
that those are called resistors.

175
00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:39.490
And we'll talk about that circuitry.

176
00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:42.570
Basically you always want to put
an LED in series with a resistor.

177
00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:46.860
If not, then if you don't then what'll
happen is you'll draw too much current

178
00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:49.860
through the LED and you'll blow it out,
it'll will burn out.

179
00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:52.630
It will be very bright for a second and
then you'll here a pop and

180
00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:53.660
it will be gone.

181
00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:55.806
You put resisters in there
just to slow down the current,

182
00:08:55.806 --> 00:08:57.113
basically to reduce the current.

183
00:08:57.113 --> 00:09:00.248
Not slow it down but to reduce
the amount of current that goes through.

184
00:09:00.248 --> 00:09:05.030
And the other side of the LED is connected
by those blue wires into the Arduino.

185
00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:08.859
And the Arduino has some program running
on it that probably turns on the LEDs,

186
00:09:08.859 --> 00:09:12.646
turns them off and on in a particular
sequence, or whatever you want it to do.

187
00:09:12.646 --> 00:09:16.801
So those are the type of components
that you will be using in the class, and

188
00:09:16.801 --> 00:09:18.961
we'll be talking about in the class.

189
00:09:18.961 --> 00:09:19.680
Thank you.

190
00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:28.289
