2
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.429
So in the last module, we gave
a high-level definition of the Internet of

3
00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:25.561
Things, give you an idea of What
an Internet of Things device is, and

4
00:00:25.561 --> 00:00:27.441
what impact it has on society.

5
00:00:27.441 --> 00:00:30.632
Now we'll go into a little bit more
technical details about how they're

6
00:00:30.632 --> 00:00:35.230
implemented, the design and implementation
of these Internet of Things devices.

7
00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.900
Now basically,
Internet of Things devices are embedded,

8
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.230
typically embedded in other objects.

9
00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.379
So say, you have a car, and you put some
Internet of Things technology inside that

10
00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:47.861
car, and
now it is an Internet of Things device.

11
00:00:47.861 --> 00:00:50.210
It is computational network and so on.

12
00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.940
It's embedded within another device,
some thing.

13
00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:59.190
So, we're gonna talk a little bit
about how you embed something,

14
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.060
embed that type of functionality
inside a regular device.

15
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.570
So part of the idea is that you want to
be able to give enhanced functionality to

16
00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:13.720
a regular device but
not add complexity to the device.

17
00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.170
So for instance, take the camera that
we're filming with right in front of me.

18
00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.543
This camera, you could've gotten a camera
40 years ago that you can use to take

19
00:01:21.543 --> 00:01:24.197
a picture with, snap a button,
take a picture.

20
00:01:24.197 --> 00:01:26.970
A new camera,
an Internet of Things camera, is network,

21
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.440
it's got computers inside,
computational technology.

22
00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.713
The same interface, you snap the button
and it takes the picture, but

23
00:01:33.713 --> 00:01:34.611
it does a lot more.

24
00:01:34.611 --> 00:01:35.826
It has a lot more enhanced features.

25
00:01:35.826 --> 00:01:38.343
Maybe it does jitters control or
something like that,

26
00:01:38.343 --> 00:01:41.201
so it's embedded within the device,
but it's well hidden.

27
00:01:41.201 --> 00:01:45.090
It's embedded behind a nice,
what we'll call natural interface.

28
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:51.381
So that the user shouldn't have to
bend to conform to the device, right?

29
00:01:51.381 --> 00:01:54.176
Instead, the device should conform
to what the user wants, and

30
00:01:54.176 --> 00:01:58.130
it's to have an interface that makes
it easy for the user to deal with.

31
00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.408
So, in order to do that, the assistance,
they have to be embedded within regular

32
00:02:02.408 --> 00:02:05.198
devices, and
they have to interact with the physical

33
00:02:05.198 --> 00:02:09.476
world through the use of sensors that read
information about the physical world,

34
00:02:09.476 --> 00:02:13.452
maybe somebody pressed a button,
a light turned on, something like that.

35
00:02:13.452 --> 00:02:16.702
Also, a set of actuators that cause
something to happen in the physical

36
00:02:16.702 --> 00:02:20.331
world that basically change the state of
the physical world, so maybe motors or

37
00:02:20.331 --> 00:02:22.130
lights or something.

38
00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.075
So we'll talk about how this
physical interaction works and

39
00:02:25.075 --> 00:02:28.491
how it's controlled inside one of
these Internet of Things devices.
