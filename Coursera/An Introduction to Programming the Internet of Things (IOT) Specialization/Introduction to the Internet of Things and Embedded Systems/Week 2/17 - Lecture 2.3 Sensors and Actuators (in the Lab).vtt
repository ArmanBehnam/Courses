2
00:00:09.553 --> 00:00:12.980
In class we've been talking
about embedded systems.

3
00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.890
And I'd like to give you a small example
of one in the flesh, so to speak.

4
00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.450
This one, it's got a sensor, an actuator
and a microcontroller in between.

5
00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.440
It's got all the basics
that we've spoken about.

6
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.840
So if we look in front of you,
we've got a bread board, right here.

7
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.660
And on this bread board, we've got our
sensor, this little blue knob right here.

8
00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.850
This blue knob is a potentiometer.

9
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.060
What it does is it senses rotation.

10
00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.040
So it's a knob, I can turn the knob, and

11
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.340
it will report back to me
the amount of rotation.

12
00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.660
It does that in terms of resistance,
so it's really a changing resistor, or

13
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:51.900
a variable resistor.

14
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.539
You turn the knob and
the resistance changes.

15
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.980
So that is connected to a microcontroller,

16
00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.050
this microcontroller right
here on the Arduino.

17
00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.030
This is the Arduino.

18
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.670
The Arduino reads the information
about the rotation, and based on that,

19
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.150
it sends signals to the actuator.

20
00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.050
The actuator is over here.

21
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:10.700
This actuator is a servo motor,

22
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.990
it's a motor that you can control
the angle to which it's rotating.

23
00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.040
You can see it has a little arm on there,
and

24
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.370
we're going to control that angle based
on the rotation of this potentiometer.

25
00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.450
So the idea is, you turn the
potentiometer, and the servo will rotate,

26
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.620
and it'll rotate according to the amount
that you turned the potentiometer.

27
00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:34.390
So, just to show you the wiring
before I show what it does, you got

28
00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.250
the potentiometer wired to, actually,
let's start with the power and ground.

29
00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.580
Everything is wired to power and
ground, so we've got power and

30
00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.120
ground which are the red and
the black coming out of the Arduino.

31
00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:50.530
Those are wired into the servo motor and
into the little bread board.

32
00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.077
So it's wired to these two
columns of bread board, so

33
00:01:53.077 --> 00:01:54.843
it's also wired to potentiometer.

34
00:01:54.843 --> 00:02:00.248
So the potentiometer, its signal is the
signal that reports how much rotation has

35
00:02:00.248 --> 00:02:05.283
occurred, that's this yellow wire
right here that goes into the Arduino.

36
00:02:05.283 --> 00:02:08.742
And then there's a green wire from
the Arduino into the servo which controls

37
00:02:08.742 --> 00:02:11.350
the angle to which the servo is turned.

38
00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.150
So let's go ahead and turn this.

39
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.090
Hold it down, there it is,
now it's working just like I wanted.

40
00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.392
I turn the potentiometer and
the servo turns.

41
00:02:23.392 --> 00:02:28.564
So this is just a simple example of
an embedded system with a sensor,

42
00:02:28.564 --> 00:02:34.557
an actuator, and a microcontroller in
between that controls the actuator and

43
00:02:34.557 --> 00:02:36.760
reads data from the sensor.

44
00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.712
