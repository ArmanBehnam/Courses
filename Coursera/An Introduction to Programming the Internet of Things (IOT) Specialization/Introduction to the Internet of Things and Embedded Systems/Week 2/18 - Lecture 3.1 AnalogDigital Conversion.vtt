00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.534
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:09.534 --> 00:00:12.947
So we're going to talk about
analog versus digital.

3
00:00:12.947 --> 00:00:17.744
If you remember several lectures ago
we talked about embedded systems,

4
00:00:17.744 --> 00:00:20.720
IT devices, and their interface.

5
00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.350
And so at the input they have
a set of sensors that receive

6
00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:26.488
data about the outside world.

7
00:00:26.488 --> 00:00:29.400
Though the sensors could be simple things
like buttons or something like that but

8
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.970
it could be a microphone, a light sensor,
a camera, something like that.

9
00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.240
But it senses data about
the outside world.

10
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.050
And then actuators on the other end,
output data to the outside world.

11
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:47.060
So maybe they're lights, LEDs or speakers,
or just a screen or something like that.

12
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:48.620
Okay, but
they send data to the outside world.

13
00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.040
So there's this interface, sensors at the
input side, actuators at the output side.

14
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.120
And so these devices, they're
sensing physical phenomenon okay, so

15
00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.454
if you look at the sensors, the sensors
are sensing physical phenomenon and

16
00:01:04.454 --> 00:01:07.888
physical phenomenon
are often analog signals.

17
00:01:07.888 --> 00:01:10.491
Okay, now let me describe this
difference between analog and

18
00:01:10.491 --> 00:01:11.699
digital just very briefly.

19
00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.000
Analog, actually a very quick
way to say it is, analog

20
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.520
to digital is the same as the difference
between real numbers and integers.

21
00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:20.940
Okay, if you remember that, right.

22
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.480
Real numbers are continuous.

23
00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.757
So if you get the number,
real numbers between 0 and 1,

24
00:01:24.757 --> 00:01:27.283
there's an infinite number of
real numbers between 0 and 1.

25
00:01:27.283 --> 00:01:32.270
0.5, 0.6, 0.7,
whatever fraction you can think of.

26
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.570
That's an infinite number of values,
of real values, between 0 and 1.

27
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.920
Now integers, however,
can only be 0, or 1, or 2, or so on.

28
00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.078
No fractions, so between 0 and 1,
there's just integers 0, integer 1,

29
00:01:46.078 --> 00:01:50.490
it's a finite number, and
a much smaller number, so no fractions.

30
00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.920
So that difference
between real numbers and

31
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.560
integers is the same as the difference
between analog and digital.

32
00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.730
So if you look at an analog value,
let's take light,

33
00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.530
okay, I've got a lot of light,
I've got these lights pointing at my face.

34
00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:03.515
Okay?

35
00:02:03.515 --> 00:02:05.820
Lights, they can be, generally,

36
00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.600
they have analog values,
the brightness has an analog value.

37
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.070
So you can take a light and have a dimmer
switch connected to it and make it

38
00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.520
a little brighter or a little darker,
right, and depending on how fine your

39
00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:22.160
control is you can have a lot of possible
values between totally off and totally on.

40
00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.800
And it's a smooth transition,
you can hit every possible value between

41
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.790
completely dark versus completely
bright by turning your dimmer switch.

42
00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.890
So in this way,
light is generally an analog phenomenon.

43
00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.160
Also sound,
you can see the same thing there.

44
00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.670
Sound I'm talking, right.

45
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.564
I can talk quietly,
I can talk loudly, [LAUGH] right?

46
00:02:40.564 --> 00:02:42.440
I can talk in between.

47
00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.610
So I can adjust my volume anywhere
in between completely quiet and

48
00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:47.200
completely loud.

49
00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.459
Again, an analog phenomenon.

50
00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.150
So the universe.

51
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.440
The world in general to
the perception of humans is analog.

52
00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.670
Now physicists will say look,
the world is digital.

53
00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.640
If you look down at a subatomic level,
look at quarks and they have fixed states.

54
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.560
Maybe things are digital in reality.

55
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.390
Okay?

56
00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:07.220
They are discreet.

57
00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.580
Either as high or low.

58
00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:09.370
Plus, minus.

59
00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.910
Right?

60
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.050
Maybe, but to our human
perceptions the world is analog.

61
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:18.620
So, a lot of these phenomena that you want
to sense are analog, sound, touch, right?

62
00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:19.770
You can push hard, push soft.

63
00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:20.570
Things like this?

64
00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:21.540
They're analog phenomena.

65
00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.620
Now, digital phenomena is something
that's either off or on, or

66
00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.500
at least has some discrete
number of states.

67
00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.650
So for instance these lights,
I could just hook them to a switch.

68
00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:31.850
They're wall switches, right?

69
00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.620
I hit off and the whole thing goes off,
or it goes on, right?

70
00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.400
So maybe I'm using my
light in a digital way.

71
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.620
It's either all off or all on.

72
00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.280
All right?
That's digital.

73
00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.710
Or that's discrete, really.

74
00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:42.140
And digital is a version of that.

75
00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.580
But that's, so that's basically
the difference between analog and digital.

76
00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.290
This is also, you get the same
definition in terms of watches, right?

77
00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.070
So my watch is a digital watch, right?

78
00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:52.440
It shows digital numbers.

79
00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.480
One second, two seconds.

80
00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.590
It doesn't show fractions between seconds.

81
00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.060
But if you look at an analog
clock where that second hand is

82
00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.000
can point at any fractional
number between seconds, right?

83
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.460
So this is analog to digital.

84
00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:08.950
Now the reason we bring
this up is because these

85
00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.870
embedded systems are interacting
with the real world.

86
00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.160
And the real world,
to our perceptions, is largely analog.

87
00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.840
So say I want to have a sensor that
senses the brightness of light.

88
00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.380
That sensor is generally going to be an
analog sensor because it's got to be able

89
00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.980
to sense, assuming that the light
is not either off or on,

90
00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:28.600
it could be a little bright, a little
dark, it's got to be an analog sensor.

91
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.930
Now the problem with
this is that our systems,

92
00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.640
the microcontrollers that we have,
they are digital systems.

93
00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:39.520
So, they only understand digital data,
specifically zeroes and ones, okay?

94
00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.870
Zeroes and ones,
binary data, that's binary.

95
00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.190
Zero or one, that's digital.

96
00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.330
In order for

97
00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:50.440
our program on our microcontroller to be
able to use information from sensors,

98
00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.090
that analog signal has been
converted to a digital value.

99
00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.690
And that is what analog to
digital conversion is for.

100
00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:59.760
So we're not going to talk in great
detail about how it's performed.

101
00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.980
Now, I have a slide, in a while I'll
show you a little bit about it.

102
00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:05.630
But how it's performed is a complicated
thing, but just understand that

103
00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.410
what it does is it takes an analog value
and converts it to a digital number.

104
00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:14.410
Now, this digital representation is maybe
an approximation of the actual analog

105
00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:15.930
value, but that's okay.

106
00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.950
It can be a pretty accurate approximation,
as accurate as we need.

107
00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:22.180
So we need analog to digital
conversion at a lot of our inputs.

108
00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.180
Not all, some of our inputs can
be buttons, like push buttons.

109
00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.380
Then that's actually naturally digital.

110
00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.950
It's either pushed or not, so zero one.

111
00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.340
But other analog inputs,
like lights and sounds and

112
00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.050
stuff like that, those things
typically have to go through analog to

113
00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:37.389
digital conversion before they
can be used in our system.

114
00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:42.670
Now on the output end, you usually
need digital to analog conversion, or

115
00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:44.670
you often need digital
to analog conversion.

116
00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:47.790
So let's say I have a microcontroller and

117
00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:50.190
it's outputting some
sound to some speakers.

118
00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.660
These speakers are analog devices,
they need analog signal.

119
00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:56.410
But the microcontroller is
outputting zeros and ones, so

120
00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:59.270
you need digital to analog conversion
to take those digital signals,

121
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:02.820
convert them to analog and
then drive the speaker with them.

122
00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.990
So it's very common to see digital
to analog conversion on the output

123
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.180
of a system and
analog to digital conversion on the input.

124
00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:10.430
Because in the middle of that system,

125
00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:13.700
in that microcontroller,
it's almost all digital.

126
00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:15.050
It's primarily digital.

127
00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:19.115
So the world is often analog, so
you need conversion on either end.

128
00:06:21.103 --> 00:06:24.186
So just to give you a little example
[COUGH] of how you might convert,

129
00:06:24.186 --> 00:06:27.420
how you might form analog
to digital conversion.

130
00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:32.820
You take some analog signal, a wave form
over time, and we see one right here.

131
00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:35.070
This is, let's say it's a sound way, okay.

132
00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:37.770
So if the sound wave, sound is pressure.

133
00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:39.200
Pressure through the air.

134
00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:40.590
And it changes over time.

135
00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:44.010
So you can measure sound waves you can
look at sound like we've seen here in this

136
00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:47.690
picture where the x axis is time.

137
00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:50.500
And the y axis is pressure in the air.

138
00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:53.260
And that's actually a sine wave that
you're looking at right there so

139
00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:54.410
that's like a pure tone.

140
00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:58.138
One frequency just a [SOUND] you know,
a frequency as pure as you can get,

141
00:06:58.138 --> 00:06:59.267
that's a sine wave.

142
00:06:59.267 --> 00:07:01.748
That's what it would sound
like at some frequency.

143
00:07:01.748 --> 00:07:06.550
So the Y-axis is generally the pressure,
the air pressure.

144
00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:09.680
Now a microphone, the job of a microphone,
is to take that pressure and

145
00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.320
convert it into voltage.

146
00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:13.430
Okay?
Because our machines can't understand

147
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:15.700
pressure, they understand voltage,
they read voltages.

148
00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:19.640
So if you look at the Y-axis as
it's labelled, it says voltage, and

149
00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:20.820
then in parentheses, pressure.

150
00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:24.250
So what they're showing is the voltage
at the output of the microphone.

151
00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:25.980
But still it's an analog waveform.

152
00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:28.430
It's smooth, the red line, it's analog.

153
00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:30.590
And it changes smoothly over time.

154
00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:34.820
Now the analog to digital converter
will take that waveform and

155
00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:38.520
represent it piece by piece
as a set of digital numbers.

156
00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:40.220
So you can see that step.

157
00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:43.090
So if you look at that
red waveform it's smooth.

158
00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:44.320
It's real numbers.

159
00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:45.850
It's an analog waveform.

160
00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:49.860
Superimpose on that you
see the stair-stepping.

161
00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:53.310
They see essentially just
a stair-stepping signal.

162
00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:55.870
That's always has discreet values.

163
00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:57.020
So there are those levels,

164
00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:01.230
those horizontal lines, each one
represents a discreet digital number.

165
00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:03.490
And you know, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

166
00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:06.690
And if you look at that stair stepping
wave form that's overlapped on top of

167
00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:08.085
the analog wave form.

168
00:08:08.085 --> 00:08:10.355
It only ever hits one of those lines.

169
00:08:10.355 --> 00:08:12.275
It's never in-between, right.

170
00:08:12.275 --> 00:08:14.505
It's at a line or up or down, right.

171
00:08:14.505 --> 00:08:15.865
That's digital.

172
00:08:15.865 --> 00:08:19.825
So you can take this analog wave form,
this red one and approximate it with this

173
00:08:19.825 --> 00:08:23.905
stair stepping digital wave form and
so at every time, every unit of time,

174
00:08:23.905 --> 00:08:28.610
the digital wave form is always at a fixed
voltage value in this case, right?

175
00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:32.040
And so you can just have a series
of voltage values over different

176
00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:33.690
points in time and store it.

177
00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:37.100
And that is an approximate
representation of analog wave form.

178
00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:39.860
And that is what analog to
digital conversion does.

179
00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:40.620
And we need it to,

180
00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:44.020
in order to represent any kind of
analog input data to the system.

181
00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:48.090
And note that on the outputs to the
actuators you get the opposite going on.

182
00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:51.090
So you start with the digital waveform,
the stair stepping waveform.

183
00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:55.070
And the digital to analog conversion
converts it into that red or

184
00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:59.230
something close to that red,
smooth analog waveform that you see.

185
00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:01.190
And that gets sent out to
whatever your actuator is.

186
00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:03.473
Say a speaker, or something like that.

187
00:09:03.473 --> 00:09:04.245
Thank you.

188
00:09:04.245 --> 00:09:08.740
