2
00:00:04.749 --> 00:00:09.349
In this module, we'll talk

3
00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:15.170
about sensors and actuators.

4
00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.530
Sensors and actuators are basically the
input and output devices of the Arduino.

5
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:23.350
Or not of the Arduino, but
the whole IOT system, really and

6
00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.780
the Arduino needs to take data
in through these sensors and

7
00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:30.010
it outputs results to the outside
world though these actuators.

8
00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.620
So we'll talk about how to use those,
how to interface those with Arduinos.

9
00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.420
Let's talk about basic sensors that sense
things about the environment, the light,

10
00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.160
the sound, the volume of sound,
things like this.

11
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.750
And how the Arduino can be made
to interpret that information.

12
00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.760
And then on the other side
we'll talk about the actuators,

13
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.200
how to control things, how to turn on and
off LEDs, we've already done that, but

14
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.100
we'll look at more complicated analog type
of actuators and how we control those.

15
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.130
Even though the Arduino
can't output analog data,

16
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:03.970
we can still control analog, control
actuators that require analog information.

17
00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:04.750
We can fool them.

18
00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:10.050
We'll talk about that with
pulsive modulation and so on.

19
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:11.140
Thank you.
