2
00:00:11.554 --> 00:00:15.080
In this module we'll talk
about Arduino shields.

3
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.240
The shields are a great thing.

4
00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.030
The shields are extra hardware
that you can use to extend

5
00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:21.110
the abilities of your Arduino.

6
00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.250
You stack these shields
on to your Arduino and

7
00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.560
the shield itself's a printed circuit
board, it has lots of circuitry to do

8
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.410
integrating lots of different pieces
of hardware already built in there.

9
00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:33.260
So the Arduino,

10
00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.130
when you get a shield, you also get a
library that you can use with the shield.

11
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.740
And it makes it very easy to extend your
Arduino to do lots of interesting things

12
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.090
that the Arduino all by
itself can never do.

13
00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:47.530
And it makes it very easy to do it.

14
00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.992
So, we're gonna go through
some of these shields and

15
00:00:49.992 --> 00:00:53.002
just talk in general about how to
use these shield libraries, and

16
00:00:53.002 --> 00:00:55.757
how to use shield to enhance
the abilities of your Arduino.

17
00:00:55.757 --> 00:00:57.317
Thank you.
