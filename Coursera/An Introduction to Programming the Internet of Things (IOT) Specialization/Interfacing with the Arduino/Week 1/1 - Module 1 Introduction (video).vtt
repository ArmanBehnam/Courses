3
00:00:11.778 --> 00:00:15.220
we'll start out by talking
about basic electronics.

4
00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:18.820
So in typical IOT devices there
are hardware components and

5
00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.160
software components that
have to work together.

6
00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.420
On the hardware side you'll have
to make some simple circuits.

7
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.390
So we'll talk a little bit about
electronics to give you the idea, and

8
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.680
to give you the understanding that you
need to make these simple circuits.

9
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.970
We'll talk about the basic components
of resistors, and the diodes, LEDs,

10
00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.840
that sort of thing, switches,
push buttons, batteries and

11
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.470
power supplies that type of thing.

12
00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:41.700
So we'll talk about those.

13
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.370
We'll talk about the basic concepts,
voltage, resistance, current.

14
00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.170
We'll talk about Ohm's Law to relate all
those together so that you can do things

15
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.000
like say you're gonna make a circuit,
you wanna drive an LED,

16
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.800
you need to figure out what
resistance you need, what resistors.

17
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.520
So we'll talk about that.

18
00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.440
Also we'll show you how to
wire these things together.

19
00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.120
That's another important thing, is that
going from the concept of what the circuit

20
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.670
should be, down to the actual circuit.

21
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:06.450
We'll talk about that.

22
00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.810
So we'll look at bred boards, and

23
00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.160
how wiring is actually done
inside these circuits.

24
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.700
And how to read a schematic, and
also how to write a schematic

25
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.216
that describes the circuits that you wanna
build, or that you wanna have built.

26
00:01:16.216 --> 00:01:16.745
Thank you.
