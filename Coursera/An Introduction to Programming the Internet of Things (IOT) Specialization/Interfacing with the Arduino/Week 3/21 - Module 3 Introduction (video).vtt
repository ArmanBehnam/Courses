2
00:00:11.361 --> 00:00:15.940
In this module, we'll talk about
libraries, Arduino, software libraries.

3
00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.140
So one of the great things
about Arduino is that

4
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.800
you have these libraries that you can
use which make the hardware simple.

5
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.770
So you don't have to understand all of
the complicated details about the hardware

6
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.520
component that you wanna access, you
can just use the library functions, and

7
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.440
you can invoke those library
functions in your sketch, and

8
00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:33.910
it will use the hardware appropriately.

9
00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.210
So it makes it easier on the user,
or on the developer.

10
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.088
So we will talk about these libraries,
we'll some of these libraries,

11
00:00:41.088 --> 00:00:42.181
a few of them will.

12
00:00:42.181 --> 00:00:44.549
There are many, many libraries, so
we can't go through all of them.

13
00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:48.915
But we'll show libraries that control some
of the components on the Arduino, EEPROM,

14
00:00:48.915 --> 00:00:51.108
and the I2C communication, and so forth.

15
00:00:51.108 --> 00:00:51.724
Thank you.
