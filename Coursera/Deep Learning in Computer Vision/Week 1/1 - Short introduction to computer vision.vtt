00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.983
[SOUND] Hello,
first I want to make a brief

2
00:00:03.983 --> 00:00:08.648
introduction to the field
of computer vision.

3
00:00:08.648 --> 00:00:10.270
What is computer vision?

4
00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:14.020
To answer this question, we need to
understand first what human vision is.

5
00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.450
There is a saying, to see is to
know what is where by looking.

6
00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.223
The goal of computer vision is to
solve the same problem on a computer.

7
00:00:21.223 --> 00:00:25.320
Thus, computer vision is regarded as
a part of artificial intelligence.

8
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.379
In computer vision we have our
own version of Turing test.

9
00:00:28.379 --> 00:00:32.320
To pass it, the computer vision system
should answer any question regarding

10
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.570
an image,
which can be answered by a human.

11
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.165
What are the main
questions about an image?

12
00:00:38.165 --> 00:00:41.750
The first question comes from
the informal definition of vision.

13
00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.330
This, what and where?

14
00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.500
What objects are seen in the image and
where are there are located?

15
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.470
This is called object detection.

16
00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.210
Some objects are more important for
us than other.

17
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.060
Because we're humans, the most important
object for us are other humans and

18
00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:56.300
their faces.

19
00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.110
Thus, it is understandable why face
detection and person detection

20
00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.620
are one of the most rigorously
researched topics in computer vision.

21
00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.020
And still they are not solved completely,
with new algorithms appearing every week.

22
00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.590
In this particular image we can see
other important objects like text, or

23
00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.500
less important, buildings and flags.

24
00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.840
After objects are detected,
we move on to know their properties.

25
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.600
Is it the picture of a city,
or it is something else?

26
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.620
What color is the sky,
how strong is the wind?

27
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.620
What can we say about this person?

28
00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.540
Currently these problems are usually
solved by image classification.

29
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.070
Possible answers are enumerated and
an algorithm predict the correct answer.

30
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.648
For example, we can divide all images into
images of cities and all the rest, and

31
00:01:39.648 --> 00:01:42.800
then it classify as city or not city.

32
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.480
To identify the particular object and
person, we usually store the images and

33
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.260
compare the current image with the stored,
which is called image retrieval.

34
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.230
We can also obtain metric
information from images,

35
00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.360
like distances between
selected points in scene.

36
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.668
We can also estimate
the shape of the object,

37
00:02:01.668 --> 00:02:05.996
position of camera relative to the object,
distance from the camera to the object.

38
00:02:05.996 --> 00:02:10.573
Currently available algorithm of metric
vision allows automated creation of fully

39
00:02:10.573 --> 00:02:14.701
textured 3D models from set of
photographs downloaded automatically from

40
00:02:14.701 --> 00:02:16.200
the Internet.

41
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.400
The quality of these models are not of
production quality yet, and you can't

42
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.110
directly put them into computer game,
but we will get there soon, I believe.

43
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.140
In our human brains we combine our
observations with prior knowledge

44
00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.620
regarding the volt.

45
00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.620
It is estimated that a quarter of
human brain is devoted to the vision.

46
00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.610
A lot of computer vision
algorithm have derived ideas

47
00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.820
from our knowledge of human vision system.

48
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.784
Probably the most influential work
computer vision is the model of human

49
00:02:46.784 --> 00:02:49.636
vision system,
which was proposed by David Marr in 70s.

50
00:02:49.636 --> 00:02:52.870
It consists of three steps.

51
00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.290
First, low-level image features,
like directed edge segments,

52
00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.410
are extracted from image to
form so-called primal sketch.

53
00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.412
From this primal sketch a two 2.5D sketch
is obtained using binocular stereo.

54
00:03:05.412 --> 00:03:09.090
Finally, high-level techniques
using prior knowledge

55
00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.230
is used to get 3D model representation
of objects in the scene.

56
00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.390
This seminal work has received so much
appraised that the most prestigious award

57
00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.750
in computer vision is named
after the Marr, the Marr Prize.

58
00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.082
This is awarded each couple
of years during ICCV,

59
00:03:23.082 --> 00:03:26.270
International Conference
on Computer Vision.

60
00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.048
The progress in computer vision
is entangled with progress

61
00:03:29.048 --> 00:03:30.109
in machine learning.

62
00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:32.646
As an example,
I want to mention the seminal work,

63
00:03:32.646 --> 00:03:36.010
the Viola-Jones face detector,
which was proposed in 2001.

64
00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.365
It was the first detector which can
elaborately detect human faces in real

65
00:03:40.365 --> 00:03:42.129
time on a personal computer.

66
00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:46.211
This was a demonstration of power of
machine learning and data collection.

67
00:03:46.211 --> 00:03:50.285
Until recently, if you saw a face
detector in a consumer product,

68
00:03:50.285 --> 00:03:54.600
it was definitely a Viola-Jones
detector or one of its derivatives.

69
00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.662
Neural networks has a long
history in computer vision.

70
00:03:59.662 --> 00:04:02.346
But since 2012,
when AlexNet was introduced,

71
00:04:02.346 --> 00:04:06.630
we are witnessing a record improvement
of computer vision algorithms.

72
00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.480
Deep learning has been successfully
applied to most of the computer

73
00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.830
vision problems.

74
00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.520
In this course we will focus on deep
learning methods in computer vision.

75
00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.060
But we will also introduce a lot of
general computer vision concepts,

76
00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.180
explain both basic and
seminal non-deep learning methods,

77
00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.055
talk about contemporary data sets.

78
00:04:23.055 --> 00:04:27.027
All to give you perspective and

79
00:04:27.027 --> 00:04:32.375
understanding of key ideas, problems,

80
00:04:32.375 --> 00:04:37.434
and achievements of computer vision.

81
00:04:37.434 --> 00:04:40.039
