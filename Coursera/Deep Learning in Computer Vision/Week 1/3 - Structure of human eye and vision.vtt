00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:05.950
Next, I will talk a little bit about human vision,

2
00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:10.340
to describe the difference between the human eyes and human vision systems,

3
00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:12.395
and a digital camera.

4
00:00:12.395 --> 00:00:16.155
Human eye works similar to the pinhole camera model.

5
00:00:16.155 --> 00:00:18.585
We have our own lenses,

6
00:00:18.585 --> 00:00:20.890
which can change shape by using ciliary muscles

7
00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.440
to focus on objects at different distances.

8
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.120
We have iris, which is colored annulus with radial muscles.

9
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:32.175
And we have our own sensory in form of a number of photoreceptor cells,

10
00:00:32.175 --> 00:00:34.615
rods and cones in the retina.

11
00:00:34.615 --> 00:00:40.080
Photoreceptor cells are connected to optical nerve with help of other neuron cells.

12
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.180
But, what we really see in the world around us is very

13
00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.645
different with what is captured by digital camera.

14
00:00:48.645 --> 00:00:53.670
The reason is that, our spatial resolution is very non-uniform,

15
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.670
we have higher resolution,

16
00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.445
but in the very small area, one angular minute.

17
00:00:59.445 --> 00:01:03.145
To imagine what one angular minute is,

18
00:01:03.145 --> 00:01:06.350
you can look at the thumbnail on the extended hand.

19
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.360
Only this small thumbnail is viewed in higher resolution.

20
00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.320
The rest of the view field is in lower resolution.

21
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.650
Our eyes focuses on specific points in the scene,

22
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.050
this process is called fixation for approximately 100 milliseconds,

23
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.520
then our eyes rapidly moves to another point in this thing.

24
00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.925
This movement is called the saccade.

25
00:01:26.925 --> 00:01:35.635
So, our eyes capture a set of sparse images in different parts of our surroundings.

26
00:01:35.635 --> 00:01:40.195
The reason why our spatial resolution is very nonuniform,

27
00:01:40.195 --> 00:01:44.595
lies in nonuniform distribution of photoreceptor cells in the retina.

28
00:01:44.595 --> 00:01:47.080
There are two types of photoreceptor cells.

29
00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.560
First are called cones,

30
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.280
and the second is called rodes.

31
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.515
Rods are sensitive to the total intensity of light.

32
00:01:54.515 --> 00:01:56.535
Cones can measure color.

33
00:01:56.535 --> 00:02:02.210
And most of the cones are located in a very small area which is called fovea,

34
00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.345
in the center of the visual field.

35
00:02:04.345 --> 00:02:08.665
The rods are distributed uniformly in the retina,

36
00:02:08.665 --> 00:02:12.770
but a number of rods are connected to a single neuron.

37
00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:19.155
So, a number of a photoreceptor cells outside the fovea produces a single number.

38
00:02:19.155 --> 00:02:23.710
And in fovea, each photoreceptor cell is connected to a specific neuron,

39
00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.395
and pass its own signal.

40
00:02:25.395 --> 00:02:33.520
The non-uniform form of distribution of cells leads to very interesting effect.

41
00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.980
During the night, if you look at the sky,

42
00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.360
you can see the sea of stars.

43
00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.645
There are a lot of stars around you and you feel all of them.

44
00:02:41.645 --> 00:02:47.500
It's very different from when we are looking to the sky during the day.

45
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.890
The reason for this is that, during night,

46
00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:59.095
the cones do not work properly because they require a larger intensity of light.

47
00:02:59.095 --> 00:03:01.320
And the rods are sensitive to light,

48
00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.750
even in low intensity range.

49
00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.355
So when we're looking at the sky at night,

50
00:03:07.355 --> 00:03:10.400
our cones are not working, and the rods are working.

51
00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.175
And because the rods are distributed evenly throughout the retina,

52
00:03:15.175 --> 00:03:18.510
then all our retina is working,

53
00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.340
and we see all the stars.

54
00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.090
It's a very interesting sensation.

55
00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.760
And the next time you look at the sky,

56
00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.160
you can try to imagine how your eyes are working,

57
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.830
and understand why you obtain this feeling.

58
00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:35.795
The movement of eyes,

59
00:03:35.795 --> 00:03:40.930
the succession of fixation points depends on the mental task.

60
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.710
For example, if you try to estimate

61
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:46.800
the material circumstances of the family in this picture,

62
00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.870
we look through all things in the room.

63
00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.110
Our eyes are fixated on all objects.

64
00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.430
If we try to answer other question,

65
00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.625
for example to estimate the age of people,

66
00:03:57.625 --> 00:04:03.165
then our eyes will fixate for a long time to each of the many faces.

67
00:04:03.165 --> 00:04:06.555
And if we want to estimate how long the visitor was away from the family,

68
00:04:06.555 --> 00:04:09.540
then our eyes will constantly change the fixation point.

69
00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.865
We will fixate on one man's face,

70
00:04:11.865 --> 00:04:17.035
then rapidly move to the other man's face to try to mentally compare the emotions.

71
00:04:17.035 --> 00:04:22.495
So, by only looking at how man's eyes are looking in the picture,

72
00:04:22.495 --> 00:04:26.555
we can predict what his mental task currently is,

73
00:04:26.555 --> 00:04:28.925
to understand what he's thinking about.

74
00:04:28.925 --> 00:04:32.700
Try to imagine what our eyes are really seeing.

75
00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:37.960
We can create a small video by combining images from fixation points.

76
00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.910
Recenter each frame at the fixation point.

77
00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.865
The result will look like a very shaky,

78
00:04:43.865 --> 00:04:46.595
like a video from a very shaky camera,

79
00:04:46.595 --> 00:04:49.930
much worse than you see in action movies for example.

80
00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.675
But, when we look at the world,

81
00:04:53.675 --> 00:04:56.800
we see that it is stable and at constant resolution.

82
00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.445
This is actually an illusion which is created by

83
00:04:59.445 --> 00:05:04.005
our mind from various parts fixation points in the surrounding world.

84
00:05:04.005 --> 00:05:06.830
A lot of mind tricks

85
00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:11.625
and psychological illusions are based on the properties of human eyes.

86
00:05:11.625 --> 00:05:14.710
You can find a lot of funny videos in the Internet,

87
00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.270
and test these illusions by yourself.

88
00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:21.235
The eyes are only the first part of a human vision system.

89
00:05:21.235 --> 00:05:24.110
From eyes, information is propagated

90
00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.650
to the back of the brain for the low level processing,

91
00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:28.520
where edge detection is performed.

92
00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.520
Then information is moving ahead and

93
00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.540
it passes over the areas of high level object recognition.

94
00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:37.210
There are specific parts in our brain that is devoted,

95
00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.020
for example to face recognition,

96
00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.245
to place recognition, and so on.

97
00:05:41.245 --> 00:05:43.940
Separate narrow stream from low level vision to

98
00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:48.660
high level object description is devoted to motion information processing.

99
00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:50.530
After high level recognition,

100
00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:54.685
the signal moves to the decision making area in frontal part of the brain.

101
00:05:54.685 --> 00:05:58.975
And approximately after 150 milliseconds from eyes,

102
00:05:58.975 --> 00:06:01.770
the information can reach the motor control center,

103
00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.920
in they react on the input visual stimuli.
