00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:06.250
The object of computer vision is a digital image.

2
00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.150
So, first of all, we should understand what the digital image is.

3
00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:12.440
Let's start from optical image.

4
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.035
Optical image is 2D representation of a physical object,

5
00:00:16.035 --> 00:00:19.575
obtained by propagation of light through some optical system,

6
00:00:19.575 --> 00:00:21.890
depicting object contours and features.

7
00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.905
As you can see from these examples,

8
00:00:23.905 --> 00:00:26.065
optical systems can be very different.

9
00:00:26.065 --> 00:00:28.520
The first image is obtained through this common camera.

10
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:35.925
Second, there's a fisheye lens camera and capture 180 degrees by 360 degrees hemisphere.

11
00:00:35.925 --> 00:00:37.795
The last image is example of

12
00:00:37.795 --> 00:00:41.575
optical tomography slight based the construction of an object.

13
00:00:41.575 --> 00:00:44.190
But mostly, they are working the simplest model,

14
00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.160
which is called the pinhole camera model.

15
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.450
This is probably the first optical system,

16
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.015
which allow humans to capture the shape of objects from projected light.

17
00:00:52.015 --> 00:00:56.175
The idea was already known to Ancient Greeks. You have a dark room.

18
00:00:56.175 --> 00:00:57.970
There's a small hole in one wall.

19
00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.490
A light come through the small hole and fall into the other hole, making an image.

20
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.740
Human artist then can draw the contour of an object.

21
00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.695
Pinhole camera captures pencils of rays.

22
00:01:08.695 --> 00:01:10.805
All rays pass to a single point.

23
00:01:10.805 --> 00:01:14.040
This point is called the center of projection or focal point.

24
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.865
The image is formed on the hole which is called image plane.

25
00:01:17.865 --> 00:01:20.515
During this perspective projection,

26
00:01:20.515 --> 00:01:24.300
the distortion of some properties of real-world objects are introduced.

27
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.270
For example, the vertical lines are convergent instead of being parallel.

28
00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.765
The exterior columns in the old same columns appear larger.

29
00:01:31.765 --> 00:01:35.390
Such distortions come not from flaws of our optical system,

30
00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.360
but are inherent properties of perspective projection.

31
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.230
This problem was first pointed out by Leonardo da Vinci himself.

32
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:47.305
During image capturing, we obtained 2D images from 3D world.

33
00:01:47.305 --> 00:01:50.955
Thus, some information is discarded. What have we lost?

34
00:01:50.955 --> 00:01:53.385
We have lost angles and distances.

35
00:01:53.385 --> 00:01:56.050
The square table is not quite in the image.

36
00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.180
The main property which is retained is linearity.

37
00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.685
If three points are located on the single line in 3D space,

38
00:02:02.685 --> 00:02:05.850
then their projections also lie on a single way.

39
00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.375
But in practice, this property also can be violated due to optical effects in lenses.

40
00:02:11.375 --> 00:02:14.070
Such effect is called radial distortions.

41
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.840
And as a result, straight lines are projected into slightly curved lines,

42
00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.900
or not so slightly if fisheye lens are used.

43
00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.105
The modern digital camera is based on the same principle as pinhole model,

44
00:02:25.105 --> 00:02:30.590
but is complex optical system and digital sensor array instead of wide wall.

45
00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.755
Digital sensory gives us discrete representation of optical image.

46
00:02:34.755 --> 00:02:37.035
First, the spatial sampling is performed.

47
00:02:37.035 --> 00:02:41.720
Sensory consist of a set of photosensitive elements on the rectangular grid.

48
00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.830
Each elements measure the total light fallen into the senior element.

49
00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.030
So, instead of continuous representation of optical image,

50
00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.655
we have only a set of samples on the grid.

51
00:02:51.655 --> 00:02:56.075
Then, the continuous measurement of light energy is also discretized.

52
00:02:56.075 --> 00:02:59.380
So, digital grayscale image is a 2D array,

53
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.585
where each value measures image brightness.

54
00:03:02.585 --> 00:03:06.615
Usually, brightness value weigh in interval from zero to one.

55
00:03:06.615 --> 00:03:09.840
We can code brightness value with one byte.

56
00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.310
So, b is usually lie in interval from 0 to 255.

57
00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.630
We can also obtain better precision by coding b is more bits.

58
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.050
In modern camera, usually from 10 to 16 bits are used.
