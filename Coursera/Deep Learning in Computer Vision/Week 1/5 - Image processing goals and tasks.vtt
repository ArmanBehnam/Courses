00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.535
Now we can move to basic image processing task.

2
00:00:06.535 --> 00:00:08.895
Why do we need to process images?

3
00:00:08.895 --> 00:00:10.830
There are several reasons for this.

4
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.680
First is, image improvement for human perception to make the image better looking,

5
00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.410
to improve the subjective image quality.

6
00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.295
The second goal is,

7
00:00:20.295 --> 00:00:23.435
to simplify the subsequent image analysis and recognition.

8
00:00:23.435 --> 00:00:26.625
So, it is image improvement from machine perception.

9
00:00:26.625 --> 00:00:30.720
Third goal is, image transformation for technical purposes.

10
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.110
For example, when we want to display video on a mobile device,

11
00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.110
we need usually to change image resolution and

12
00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.835
aspect ratio without damaging the content of the video.

13
00:00:42.835 --> 00:00:45.580
And the last reason is, pure entertainment.

14
00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:51.815
It's visual effects to get artistic impressions from the effect itself.

15
00:00:51.815 --> 00:00:54.885
There are no particular reasons for these effects,

16
00:00:54.885 --> 00:00:56.320
but they can be fun.

17
00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.530
And a lot of cool applications for

18
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.950
mobile devices exist that apply visual effects to images.

19
00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.550
Where are the sources of errors and image defect?

20
00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.635
Let's look at the image transfer pipeline from

21
00:01:09.635 --> 00:01:13.065
real world objects to its presentations on the computer display.

22
00:01:13.065 --> 00:01:16.220
First, optical image is formed in the camera.

23
00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.915
Then, it is passed through the wire pattern to the sensory,

24
00:01:19.915 --> 00:01:21.715
where it is discretized.

25
00:01:21.715 --> 00:01:26.415
Then, it is transferred via computer network and displayed on the display.

26
00:01:26.415 --> 00:01:31.860
In all stages in which data is transformed and during each transformation,

27
00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:38.430
there can be errors and edit artifacts which we should process.

28
00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.380
I will give several examples of

29
00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.835
image defects that can be compensated by image processing.

30
00:01:43.835 --> 00:01:46.790
First, images can be of low contrast with

31
00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.010
detail difficult to see in bright or dark areas.

32
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.980
Second, color tone can look wrong.

33
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.290
This picture should be more brownish.

34
00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:03.490
In this slide, it is more in blue tones, which is unrealistic.

35
00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.530
Images can be noisy or blurry because of sharp details.

36
00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.030
Lighting in captured documents can be non-uniform,

37
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.700
where part of the text is very bright and part of the text is very dark.

38
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.345
So it's very difficult to recognize such type of document.

39
00:02:20.345 --> 00:02:25.360
Image processing can also be used to extract meaningful information from images.

40
00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.025
One example, I will discuss later, is edge detection.

41
00:02:29.025 --> 00:02:32.510
Edges contain a lot of interesting information

42
00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.285
regarding images and can be used as image features for recognition.

43
00:02:37.285 --> 00:02:41.300
A lot of algorithm rely on edge detection.
