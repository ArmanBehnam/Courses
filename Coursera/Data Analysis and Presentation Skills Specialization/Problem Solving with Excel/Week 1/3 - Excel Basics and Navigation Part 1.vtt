00:00:10.676 --> 00:00:12.380
Hi, and welcome to the first of the series
of the Excel demos and exercises.

3
00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:18.590
During this section, I am going to
give you an overview of the basic

4
00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.850
Excel functions and
how to navigate an Excel workbook.

5
00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.640
If you have never used Excel before,
you might be wondering what a function or

6
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.110
a workbook is.

7
00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.880
Remember that you can always
review the course glossary for

8
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.270
clarification of any of the terms
that might be new to you.

9
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.470
Let's start with an overview
of the Excel ribbon.

10
00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.610
When you open an Excel workbook, you will
see that there's a ribbon at the very top

11
00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.180
that provides a number of
options including the Home page,

12
00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.050
Insert, Page Layout, etc.

13
00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.661
You can navigate this ribbon by
clicking through the different tabs and

14
00:00:50.661 --> 00:00:52.599
selecting any of the listed options.

15
00:00:52.599 --> 00:00:57.856
On the Home tab, you will find all of
the Copy/Paste options as well as text

16
00:00:57.856 --> 00:01:03.125
formatting options, cell alignment,
formatting and editing options.

17
00:01:03.125 --> 00:01:08.555
On the Insert tab, you will find
buttons that let you insert Tables,

18
00:01:08.555 --> 00:01:15.406
Illustrations, Images, Charts, Links,
Objects, Symbols and many, many more.

19
00:01:15.406 --> 00:01:18.568
On the Page Layout tab,
you will find various options

20
00:01:18.568 --> 00:01:23.470
that allow you to change the settings on
how the Excel page is being displayed.

21
00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.660
Here you can, for example,
change the theme, the colors,

22
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.860
you can also define the print area and
layout.

23
00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.088
And you can also move objects, backwards,
forwards and many more things.

24
00:01:35.088 --> 00:01:36.415
On the Formula tab,

25
00:01:36.415 --> 00:01:41.270
you will find different libraries
that contain various functions.

26
00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.477
You will also find the Name Manager
that is used for named ranges, something

27
00:01:45.477 --> 00:01:49.699
that we will cover later in this course
as well as Formula Auditing options.

28
00:01:49.699 --> 00:01:54.396
On the Data tab, you will find options
to import external data, to sort and

29
00:01:54.396 --> 00:01:59.093
filter the data that is currently in
the workbook, as well as various other

30
00:01:59.093 --> 00:02:02.540
tools that will facilitate
data manipulation.

31
00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.623
On the Review tab, you will find options
to review the sheet such as spellcheck,

32
00:02:07.623 --> 00:02:10.338
inserting comments, and track changes.

33
00:02:10.338 --> 00:02:15.456
On the View tab, you will find options for
different workbook views,

34
00:02:15.456 --> 00:02:20.710
zooming in or zooming out,
freezing panes, and viewing macros.

35
00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:25.080
You can also navigate the ribbon
using the Alt key shortcut.

36
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.750
When you press the Alt key,

37
00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.560
letters appear on the ribbon showing
the different options that are available.

38
00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.490
For example, if I hit the Alt key followed
by H this takes me to the Home tab.

39
00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.035
And additional letters up here under each
of the available commands on this tab.

40
00:02:41.035 --> 00:02:45.010
This feature is very useful for
learning keyboard shortcuts.

41
00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.410
It is important to note that some people
may mention keyboard shortcuts that vary

42
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.500
from this breadcrumb method.

43
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.690
These are old holdover shortcuts that will
still work in Excel from prior versions.

44
00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.870
Throughout the course,
we will talk about keyboard shortcuts.

45
00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.030
As a leading practice,

46
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.750
I wouldn't recommend trying to
memorize every single shortcut.

47
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.900
But as you find yourself using
the same command over and

48
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.170
over again, try to shift to learning
the associated keyboard shortcut.

49
00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.017
Over time,
your keyboard vocabulary will expand.

50
00:03:15.017 --> 00:03:19.841
The ribbon at the top of the Excel
workbook is entirely customizable,

51
00:03:19.841 --> 00:03:22.560
you can rearrange the different tabs,

52
00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.750
you can add in new tools, and

53
00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.390
you can make any changes to
suit your personal preferences.

54
00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:29.620
Right below the ribbon,

55
00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.360
there's a cell that shows you where you
are currently located in the workbook.

56
00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:39.290
Note that the names of the cells
begin with A1 in the top-left corner.

57
00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.810
Columns are named with letters and
rows are named with numbers.

58
00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.180
We will discuss named ranges later
in this course, but if the selected

59
00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.220
cells are named, you would see the name
of that range appear here as well.

60
00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.460
Next to the cell location box,
you will find the Formula bar.

61
00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:02.870
This is where we will be entering Excel
formulas and/or text strings as inputs.

62
00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.370
A formula is a calculation
performed by Excel

63
00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.240
resulting in a value that will
be displayed in the cell.

64
00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.780
You always start an Excel
formula using the equal sign.

65
00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.660
This informs Excel that
a formula is being entered and

66
00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.470
will require a calculation
versus a pure input.

67
00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:28.070
Formulas can include numbers, for example,
when entering a simple equation, and

68
00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.060
can also reference other
cells in the workbook.

69
00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.180
Commas and parentheses are used to
separate different parts of an Excel

70
00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:41.090
function. Excel performs calculations
using PEMDAS order of operations,

71
00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.700
just the way any mathematical
equation would work.

72
00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.144
PEMDAS stands for parenthesis, exponents,

73
00:04:48.144 --> 00:04:52.743
multiplication, division,
addition, and subtraction.

74
00:04:56.467 --> 00:05:00.518
Let's practice writing a simple formula
that will perform a mathematical

75
00:05:00.518 --> 00:05:01.660
calculation.

76
00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.325
First, we go to cell B13, and

77
00:05:03.325 --> 00:05:07.043
we double-click in order to enter
into the cell and begin the editing.

78
00:05:09.891 --> 00:05:12.609
We start the formula by typing the = sign,

79
00:05:12.609 --> 00:05:18.090
this will let Excel know that we
are going to be calculating something.

80
00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.282
Now, I'm going to write the formula
that is indicated above,

81
00:05:21.282 --> 00:05:23.400
pressing Enter to signal that I'm done.

82
00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:41.798
As you can see,

83
00:05:41.798 --> 00:05:45.651
Excel calculates the answer just the way
you would do it on a calculator.

84
00:05:45.651 --> 00:05:55.651
