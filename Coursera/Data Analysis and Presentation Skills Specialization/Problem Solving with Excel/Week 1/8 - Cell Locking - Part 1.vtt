00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.530
The next topic that
we're going to

2
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:09.810
discuss is cell locking.

3
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.420
Cell locking is a powerful tool

4
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.090
that is used
extensively in Excel.

5
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.820
As we saw in the
previous section,

6
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.390
Excel uses relative
references within formulas.

7
00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.510
This means that it
will automatically

8
00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:25.430
move the cells that are being

9
00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.260
referenced when the formula is

10
00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.690
pasted across rows or columns.

11
00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:31.730
Sometimes this is
exactly what you

12
00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.280
want to do, but not always.

13
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.410
This is where cell
locking comes into

14
00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.405
play when you do not want

15
00:00:38.405 --> 00:00:40.160
Excel to move across rows and

16
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.620
columns using
relative references.

17
00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.545
Cell locking
basically tells Excel

18
00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:49.505
not to move the reference
when copying and pasting.

19
00:00:49.505 --> 00:00:53.705
A locked cell is indicated
by a dollar sign.

20
00:00:53.705 --> 00:00:58.160
A dollar sign in the front
of a column letter locks

21
00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.530
the column and a dollar sign in

22
00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.820
front of the row
number locks the row.

23
00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.740
If you put a dollar sign in

24
00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.355
both the front letter
and the back row number,

25
00:01:10.355 --> 00:01:12.950
you lock the cell entirely.

26
00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.340
You can lock the cell
by manually typing out

27
00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.700
the dollar sign or by using

28
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.510
the F4 shortcut key to place

29
00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.070
the dollar signs in

30
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.920
a different combination
around the row,

31
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.220
column, both, or none.

32
00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.100
Cell locking helps increase

33
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.040
efficiency when
performed correctly,

34
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.750
and also helps you avoid

35
00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.765
hard coding values
within a formula.

36
00:01:41.765 --> 00:01:45.110
Second, I find many
spreadsheet errors

37
00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.530
come from lack of cell
locking or hard coding.

38
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.975
Let's practice cell locking.

39
00:01:51.975 --> 00:01:55.790
In exercise 1, we're
being asked to calculate

40
00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.755
the monthly savings using a
five percent growth rate.

41
00:01:59.755 --> 00:02:03.640
That can be found in cell L12.

42
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.830
We're going to start
by calculating

43
00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.070
the savings in
February by applying

44
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:15.585
the five percent growth rate
to January savings of $100.

45
00:02:15.585 --> 00:02:17.295
We start by typing

46
00:02:17.295 --> 00:02:22.895
equals followed by the amount
of the savings in January,

47
00:02:22.895 --> 00:02:25.255
which can be found in G12.

48
00:02:25.255 --> 00:02:32.045
We then multiply the value
by 1 plus the growth rate,

49
00:02:32.045 --> 00:02:34.710
which can be found in L12.

50
00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.225
As you can see,

51
00:02:37.225 --> 00:02:40.800
the savings for
February will be $105.

52
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.680
The same formula can be

53
00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.425
used to calculate the
remaining months.

54
00:02:45.425 --> 00:02:48.620
So let's copy down the
rest of the tables.

55
00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.565
Notice that something
must have gone wrong,

56
00:02:52.565 --> 00:02:55.880
since the savings for the
rest of the month remained

57
00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.780
constant instead of
growing by five percent.

58
00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.050
If we go into the
savings for June and

59
00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.335
press F2 to open the function,

60
00:03:06.335 --> 00:03:08.720
we can see that Excel is

61
00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.060
trying to use a
growth rate in cell

62
00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:17.715
L16 instead of referencing
the five percent in L12.

63
00:03:17.715 --> 00:03:22.670
As discussed, before we
move the formula down

64
00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.175
one row and the reference

65
00:03:25.175 --> 00:03:28.490
will move the exact same manner.

66
00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:31.595
This is a perfect example

67
00:03:31.595 --> 00:03:34.780
of how Excel uses
relative references.

68
00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.465
When we copy the formulas down,

69
00:03:37.465 --> 00:03:40.790
Excel automatically increase
the row numbers for

70
00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.285
the amount of savings,
which is good.

71
00:03:44.285 --> 00:03:46.820
But it also will increase

72
00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:50.720
the row number for the
growth percentage,

73
00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.490
which is not what we wanted.

74
00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:54.650
We wanted that five percent being

75
00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.055
multiplied by each month.

76
00:03:57.055 --> 00:04:00.890
We can use cell locking
to tell Excel that we

77
00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.210
do not want it to increase

78
00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:04.745
the row numbers for
the growth rate.

79
00:04:04.745 --> 00:04:06.650
In order to do so,

80
00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.515
let's go back to the
formula for February,

81
00:04:09.515 --> 00:04:12.175
and if we press F2,

82
00:04:12.175 --> 00:04:15.540
it opens the formula
and let's us edit it.

83
00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.030
When we lock both the
column and the row,

84
00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:20.450
we're going to add

85
00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:25.415
a dollar sign in front of
both the L and the 12.

86
00:04:25.415 --> 00:04:29.915
Now the formula is
ready for copying down.

87
00:04:29.915 --> 00:04:33.750
Let's copy and paste
it down the table.

88
00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.260
As you can see, the
savings grows every month.

89
00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.270
We're going to do
the same thing for

90
00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.460
savings in column
H. Only this time,

91
00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:45.950
we will be using

92
00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:50.065
the F4 shortcut to lock
down our growth rate.

93
00:04:50.065 --> 00:04:53.900
First, let's write our
growth rate formula

94
00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.300
for February the same
way we did before.

95
00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.360
As we can see,

96
00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.625
this calculates the correct
value for February.

97
00:05:03.625 --> 00:05:07.160
However, we already know we can't

98
00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.450
copy this value down unless
we lock in the growth rate.

99
00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:15.980
In order for us to lock cell L12,

100
00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:18.170
we click on the reference within

101
00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:22.820
that formula and then
press F4 to lock it.

102
00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.470
As you can see,

103
00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:27.800
Excel puts in dollar
signs locking

104
00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.405
the cell entirely when you
click F4 for the first time.

105
00:05:32.405 --> 00:05:36.200
Now if we press F4 again,

106
00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.055
we notice one of the
dollar signs is removed.

107
00:05:39.055 --> 00:05:42.255
The cell row has now been locked,

108
00:05:42.255 --> 00:05:44.400
but the column has not.

109
00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.185
If we press F4 again,

110
00:05:47.185 --> 00:05:49.520
we see the dollar sign has

111
00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.840
moved from the row to the column,

112
00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.630
and if we did it one more time,

113
00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:59.615
we go back to the
cell being unlocked.

114
00:05:59.615 --> 00:06:02.030
We want to lock the growth rate.

115
00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.680
So let's press F4 one
more time to do that.

116
00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:10.860
Now the formula is ready
to be copied down.

117
00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:13.745
As you can see,

118
00:06:13.745 --> 00:06:15.380
the growth rate is calculated

119
00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:18.230
correctly for each of the months.

120
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:20.090
Now it's your turn to

121
00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:24.065
practice cell locking
with exercise 1B.

122
00:06:24.065 --> 00:06:27.590
Remember that you can lock
the cell entirely by adding

123
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:32.730
the dollar sign manually or
by using the F4 shortcut.
