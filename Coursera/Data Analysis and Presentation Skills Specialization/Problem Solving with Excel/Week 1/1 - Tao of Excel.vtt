2
00:00:11.562 --> 00:00:13.489
Hey there, my name is James Larmer.

3
00:00:13.489 --> 00:00:17.248
I'm part of PWC's Global Analytical
leadership team.

4
00:00:17.248 --> 00:00:21.978
As Alex mentions, we're going to explore
using Excel as a tool for analysis and

5
00:00:21.978 --> 00:00:23.152
problem solving.

6
00:00:23.152 --> 00:00:26.998
Maybe just starting out with Excel or
perhaps you're a statistician, or

7
00:00:26.998 --> 00:00:30.110
a mathematician and work with SAS,
or Python, or MATLAB.

8
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.200
Or you're extracting insights using Azure,
AWS, Vertica, or Aster.

9
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.720
Or maybe you're building
a financial model from scratch,

10
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.070
at some point
you'll turn to Excel to help you and

11
00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.850
your team make better decisions.

12
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.810
What we want to do over this
course is to set a foundation

13
00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.820
that will help you use
Excel more effectively, and

14
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.310
to do so in a way that makes
you a pleasure to work with.

15
00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.390
Let's start with a few principles that we
encourage you to keep in mind throughout

16
00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.460
this course and
your ongoing work with Excel.

17
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.160
We like to say that
effective work in Excel

18
00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.430
should always include a bias
towards elegant simplicity.

19
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.090
To achieve this, we need to keep in
mind the following five concepts.

20
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.520
Simplicity, that building data sets and
analysis tools as simply possible,

21
00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.290
decreases the chance of errors and

22
00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:26.010
allows those unfamiliar with the model to
easily understand scenarios and results.

23
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.310
Traceability, so

24
00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.560
that those who do not help build your
model will be able to understand where

25
00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.840
the data is coming from with easily
traceable dependents and precedents.

26
00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.050
Consistency, make sure that all the data
is in the same denomination for

27
00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.270
example, formatting,
those kinds of things,

28
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.160
so that it makes the overall
model easier to understand.

29
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.980
Adaptability, that allows for quick and
accurate changes to assumptions and

30
00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.030
variables without significant
re-tooling of formulas.

31
00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.170
And finally, ease of use,
by creating well thought out and

32
00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.440
documented models, you facilitate the use
of the tools you built and allow for

33
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.320
transfer of ownership without the need for
a steep learning curve.

34
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.720
To help us achieve this
elegant simplicity,

35
00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.030
we have a set of guiding principles
that I think you'll find useful.

36
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.220
By the way, a reading assignment will be
available in your course materials that

37
00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.620
gives greater detail but
here's a quick overview.

38
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.380
Principle one, remember that
Excel is a deliverable used to

39
00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.250
communicate your findings,
I call it being client ready.

40
00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.210
Take the time to layout your
thought process and analysis.

41
00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.220
Simple things like headers, sources, and

42
00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.660
footnotes will help you
focus your analysis.

43
00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.710
Second, begin with the end in mind.

44
00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.660
The few minutes you take 
outlining your analysis and

45
00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.720
creating a story board can greatly
enhance your work and its impact.

46
00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.290
Third, start with a template.

47
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.060
The chances are you're doing a lot
of the same simple tasks over and

48
00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.430
over, removing grid lines,
placing and formatting headers.

49
00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.080
Setting up print areas, footers,
headers, those kinds of things.

50
00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.850
More advanced users may have developed
an MPV model or some other tool.

51
00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.900
Why not create a template once and
give yourself a jumpstart for

52
00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:19.640
your next assignment?

53
00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.070
Fourth, separate the data.

54
00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.310
Each data table you work with or

55
00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.289
have downloaded should go in
its own separate worksheet.

56
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.150
The rest of your analysis simply takes
advantage of Excel's powerful functions

57
00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.260
and formulas to extract just
what you need when you need it.

58
00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.490
Number five, highlight and
limit any hard coding.

59
00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.624
Whenever possible utilize formulas,

60
00:03:45.624 --> 00:03:50.720
in fact, one of the most powerful features
of Excel are its formulas and functions,

61
00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.010
and we will show you some of
our favorites in this course.

62
00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.060
But if you do need to enter a hard number,
an assumption about growth rates for

63
00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.760
example, shade your inputs a distinct
color to make them stand out.

64
00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.880
Now, my favorite color is blue,

65
00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.820
so chances are if you get a workbook
from me you'll see lots of blue.

66
00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:14.150
Number six, for large complex formulas,
think about breaking it down.

67
00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.420
There's no need in Excel to solve
an entire problem with one formula.

68
00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.290
In fact, if you take the time and

69
00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:25.260
space to build up your own analysis
you will often get to a better result.

70
00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.200
Number seven, once your work is done,
do a thorough review.

71
00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:31.420
It's not uncommon for

72
00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:36.090
errors to occur but they can be
minimized by double-checking your work.

73
00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.290
One useful technique is to
calculate an important number in

74
00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.810
two different ways to make
sure your analysis is correct.

75
00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.790
Principle 8, ask for help or look online.

76
00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.950
If you find something is
taking too long to complete,

77
00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:50.269
chances are there is a better way.

78
00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:56.110
Seek out the Excel gurus in your network
or office or search for a thread.

79
00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.240
There is likely a blog or a video
out there that will help you quickly

80
00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.890
figure out the syntax for a formula or
help you construct your analysis.

81
00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:08.120
Finally, our 9th principle,
use the keyboard.

82
00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.710
We like to encourage our analysts to
throw out the mouse and use shortcuts.

83
00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.750
There are dozens of keyboard shortcuts.

84
00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:18.590
Taking the time to learn them now will
dramatically reduce the time it takes for

85
00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:20.290
you to work in Excel.

86
00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:23.790
We'll share some of those in
the materials for this course.

87
00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:26.330
That was a high level overview
of the principles but

88
00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.590
you're going to see it all in
detail in the reading assignment.

89
00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.430
Make sure you take the time to
read through the information.

90
00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.230
You may find it helpful to download
the reading for future reference.

91
00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:39.040
So that's our introduction to
some basic concepts to keep in

92
00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.450
mind as you learn about and
begin to work with Excel.

93
00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:45.990
I'll be back at the beginning of
each week to help start you off.

94
00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:48.880
I'll then hand you off to one
of my colleagues who'll give you

95
00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.950
detailed instructions and
a chance to practice what you've learned.

96
00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.305
Thanks for joining us.

97
00:05:54.305 --> 00:05:57.095
