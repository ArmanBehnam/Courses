2
00:00:10.706 --> 00:00:15.761
In this section, we will be talking
about the subtotal function in Excel.

3
00:00:15.761 --> 00:00:21.330
The subtotal function returns a subtotal
value from a list or a database.

4
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.917
You can use it to calculate a sum,
an average, a count,

5
00:00:25.917 --> 00:00:30.799
as well as a number of other mathematical
functions that are useful on working

6
00:00:30.799 --> 00:00:31.859
with data sets.

7
00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.790
You may be wondering why anyone would
use subtotal to sum a set of values

8
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:36.910
in the list,

9
00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.530
when I could just value directly
using the sum function.

10
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.600
There are two major reasons for
using subtotal.

11
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.380
The first,

12
00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.630
being that it will allow you to perform
dynamic calculations on a data set.

13
00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:50.860
What this means is that

14
00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.660
if you were to filter that data set
down to a select set of points,

15
00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:01.030
the subtotal function will calculate the
sum of only the points that you selected,

16
00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.060
whereas sum function will still be
calculating the some of the entire range

17
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.240
even though those fields have been hidden.

18
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.800
The second reason for
using subtotal is that it ignores

19
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.990
any fields containing a subtotal function
that are within the data set itself.

20
00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.400
This means that you can sum a list
containing multiple subtotal sums

21
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.520
without having to worry
about double counting.

22
00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.150
The subtotal function
takes two main arguments.

23
00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.910
The first, being the function that you
want Excel to perform and the second,

24
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.830
being the data set on which you
want to perform the function.

25
00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.298
Now, let's practice subtotals.

26
00:01:38.298 --> 00:01:42.570
In exercise 1, you'll notice that we
have been given a data set that shows

27
00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.850
the month, the team and
the total sales that those teams made.

28
00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.620
If we select the sales totals,

29
00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:56.070
we will notice that this column is in
is a named range labeled as sales A.

30
00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.200
We will be using named
ranges going forward.

31
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.110
First, we are asked to
calculate the sum of the sales,

32
00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.920
so let's start by typing = in cell G12,
followed by sub.

33
00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.660
We then select the named range sales A.

34
00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.550
Pressing enter,
we see that the total sum is $18,413.

35
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.940
Next, we're going to calculate
the average number of sales.

36
00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.210
So, let's start by typing = again,
and then typing out average.

37
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.350
We don't want to calculate
the average of the sales, so

38
00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:35.776
we're going to use the named range again
and we find that the average is $1,674.

39
00:02:35.776 --> 00:02:41.678
Now, let's calculate the count,
seeing how many sales were made.

40
00:02:41.678 --> 00:02:47.625
We type = again, then count and
we select the sales data.

41
00:02:47.625 --> 00:02:52.175
We can see that there're 11 cells in
the table that we're currently looking at.

42
00:02:52.175 --> 00:02:55.325
Now that we have calculated the sum,
average and

43
00:02:55.325 --> 00:02:58.785
count of the sales using
the basic Excel functions,

44
00:02:58.785 --> 00:03:03.250
let's do the same thing, but
this time we'll be using subtotal.

45
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.760
First, we are going to
calculate the sum of the sales.

46
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.950
So let's start by typing
= followed by subtotal.

47
00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.055
Notice how Excel will prompt us to provide
the function that we want to perform.

48
00:03:16.055 --> 00:03:17.985
Here, we want to use sum.

49
00:03:17.985 --> 00:03:23.745
So let's go ahead and double click on
sum in the list to select this function.

50
00:03:23.745 --> 00:03:26.065
Next, Excel's going to ask us for

51
00:03:26.065 --> 00:03:29.285
the data set that we want to
perform this function on.

52
00:03:29.285 --> 00:03:31.835
This is the named range for Sales A.

53
00:03:31.835 --> 00:03:34.625
Close the parenthesis and press enter.

54
00:03:34.625 --> 00:03:37.580
Notice that this gives us the same sum

55
00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:42.567
as using the basic sum
function which is $18,413.

56
00:03:42.567 --> 00:03:48.700
Let's do the same thing to calculate the
average number of sales using subtotal.

57
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.285
We start by typing = followed by subtotal.

58
00:03:52.285 --> 00:03:56.225
We see that the average function
is indicated by the number 1

59
00:03:56.225 --> 00:03:57.715
in the drop down.

60
00:03:57.715 --> 00:04:00.095
So, instead of double
clicking on the average,

61
00:04:00.095 --> 00:04:04.140
we're going to go ahead and
simply type 1 followed by a comma.

62
00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:09.600
Now, Excel is asking us to input the cells
that we want to perform that function on.

63
00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.170
Once again we are going to put
the sales data that is a named range.

64
00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:19.520
Again, notice that this gives us the same
value as the basic average function

65
00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:23.250
which is $1,674.

66
00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.530
This is because we are currently showing
all of the fields in the data set.

67
00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.440
We'll talk more about this later.

68
00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.860
Last but not least,

69
00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.430
we are going to calculate the count
of sales using the subtotal function.

70
00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.570
Once again,
we start by typing = followed by subtotal.

71
00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:44.220
We see that count is the second entry
in the drop down, so we type 2,

72
00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.470
and now we select the sales data.

73
00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:51.590
And once more, this is the same value that
we found using the simple count function.

74
00:04:55.498 --> 00:04:58.940
Now, let's see what happens
when we filter the data set.

75
00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.910
Let's start with applying the filters.

76
00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:05.040
To do this, first we select headers and
then we click on the sort and

77
00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:09.890
filter option on the home tab,
selecting filter from the drop down.

78
00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:14.740
As you can see, filters are now showing
on the header row of the data table.

79
00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.430
If I were to filter the table as it is,

80
00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:21.950
it will hide the rows that don't have
the matching data that I am looking for.

81
00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:25.500
Since our calculation fields
are on some of those rows,

82
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.190
portions of the calculations
make it hidden.

83
00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:34.120
Hence, I'm going to cutter sum, average,
and count calculations using the Ctrl+X

84
00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:39.810
shortcut and paste them below
the data table using Ctrl+V.

85
00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:43.850
Now that we are all set up, let's say
we want to know the total sales for

86
00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:45.790
the month of January.

87
00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:50.761
In order to answer that question,
we go to column B and

88
00:05:50.761 --> 00:05:56.934
we filter the month for Jan. Did

89
00:05:56.934 --> 00:06:01.800
you notice what happened to our sum,
average and count values below the table?

90
00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:06.100
The values that are calculated using
the basic function have not changed.

91
00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:10.800
They are still calculating the total
value of the entire data table.

92
00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:16.210
However, the values that are calculated
using the subtotal function have changed.

93
00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:19.970
They now calculate only on the records
that are currently showing

94
00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:20.740
in the data table.

95
00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:23.930
Let's try this one more time.

96
00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:26.930
Instead of focusing on the sales
per month, let's try and

97
00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:31.030
look at how many sales teams 3 and
2 have made.

98
00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:33.350
First, we have to unfilter the months.

99
00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:40.075
So let's click on the filter in column B
and click on select all, followed by OK.

100
00:06:40.075 --> 00:06:45.035
Now we can see the entire data table
again and we notice that the values

101
00:06:45.035 --> 00:06:50.940
below the table are the same for the basic
functions as for the subtotal functions.

102
00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:56.583
Now we're going to go ahead and
filter the team column for team 3 and

103
00:06:56.583 --> 00:07:03.230
team 2 by clicking on the filtering column
C and selecting teams 3 and team 2.

104
00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:09.595
Notice once more, how the values
calculated using the the subtotal function

105
00:07:09.595 --> 00:07:12.040
update to show only the results for

106
00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:15.070
the records that are currently
being shown in the table.

107
00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:20.110
Now, it's your turn to practice
subtotals with exercise 1b.

108
00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:24.405
Enter the different formulas the same
way that we just practiced and

109
00:07:24.405 --> 00:07:29.068
then play around with the filters on
the data set to see how the basic, sum,

110
00:07:29.068 --> 00:07:33.089
average and count formulas differ
from the subtotal versions.

111
00:07:33.089 --> 00:07:39.396
