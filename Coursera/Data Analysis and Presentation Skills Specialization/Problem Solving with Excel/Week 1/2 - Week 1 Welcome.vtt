2
00:00:11.284 --> 00:00:12.152
Welcome back.

3
00:00:12.152 --> 00:00:15.793
As promised, I'm back to get you
started with your first week's lessons.

4
00:00:15.793 --> 00:00:19.207
Before we teach you how to
solve problems using Excel,

5
00:00:19.207 --> 00:00:23.379
we need to make sure you're using
Excel in the most effective way.

6
00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.090
While many of you may already be
familiar with Excel and its functions,

7
00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.030
we want to make sure that all of you
get the most out of this course and

8
00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:36.270
that you are all starting with the same
baseline knowledge as we move forward.

9
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.060
Even if you're already experienced with
Excel, I encourage you to go through all

10
00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.810
of these instructions as you will
probably learn some new functions and

11
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.189
have a chance to review
those you already use.

12
00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.050
We're going to start with
general navigation within Excel.

13
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.130
Then we're going to move into formulas and
how they're used.

14
00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.770
You know,
there are a lot of functions in Excel,

15
00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.490
but there's probably ten critical
functions that you really need to know.

16
00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.900
We'll teach what those are and
how best to use them.

17
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.570
Following formulas, we're going to look
at some other functions, like paste,

18
00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.690
cell locking, named ranges,
traceability and sub-total.

19
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.010
We'll finish out the week with
a look at text formatting.

20
00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.300
After we've gone over all of these tools
and functions, you'll be given an exercise

21
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.749
to complete in order to practice and
demonstrate what you've learned.

22
00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.780
My colleagues will be guiding you through
each of these topics, so don't worry.

23
00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:32.120
Following their guided demonstrations,
you'll be given a chance to practice

24
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.110
in an Excel workbook and
to demonstrate what you've learned.

25
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.310
Each topic builds on the last, so

26
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.379
be sure to work your way
through the lessons in order.

27
00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.410
When I first started working with Excel I
quickly realized what a powerful program

28
00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:46.390
it is.

29
00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:47.430
But it took a lot of practice.

30
00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.120
Enjoy the lessons and
the exercises presented this week.

31
00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.460
I'll be back next week as we begin
to dive deeper into Excel together.

32
00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:57.482
Thanks for joining me.

33
00:01:57.482 --> 00:02:04.258
