2
00:00:11.442 --> 00:00:13.224
Welcome to Problem solving with Excel.

3
00:00:13.224 --> 00:00:17.047
The second course in the data analysis and
presentation skills:

4
00:00:17.047 --> 00:00:20.110
The PwC approach specialization.

5
00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.248
If you were with us for
the first course, you may remember me.

6
00:00:23.248 --> 00:00:26.530
I'm Alex Mannella, and I'm going
to get you started in the course,

7
00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:31.250
introduce you to one of my colleagues,
and talk about how this course will run.

8
00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.630
I'll then be back at the end of
the course to wrap things up.

9
00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.380
In this course,
we're going to explore Excel as a tool for

10
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.500
solving business problems.

11
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.390
In order to do that,
we're going to start with teaching you

12
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.340
basic functions in Excel,
then build on that to advance your skills.

13
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.820
Along the way, you'll have a chance
to practice functions you learn and

14
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.960
to do some exercises that will give
you a chance to bring it all together.

15
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.751
Finally, we'll wrap up the course with a
final project that will allow you to apply

16
00:00:59.751 --> 00:01:03.460
lessons from this course to build
your own Excel analysis tool.

17
00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.200
There's something I'd
like you to keep in mind.

18
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.570
In this specialization, we're using Excel
to teach you how to think about analysis

19
00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.520
and to solve problems.

20
00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.220
We're also using it because it's a tool
that's widely available to most of you.

21
00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.070
There are many tools that we
use with our clients everyday.

22
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.540
Tools that will serve a wide
variety of functions.

23
00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.630
It's always important to choose the tool
that fits the needs of the client and

24
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.240
of the analysis you'll be conducting.

25
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.021
In some cases, it maybe Excel,

26
00:01:34.021 --> 00:01:35.718
in others maybe Python,

27
00:01:35.718 --> 00:01:38.750
while on others it maybe R or SaaS.

28
00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.749
Regardless of the tool, the key question
is, what problem are we trying to solve

29
00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:48.545
with what data and how do we best get to
the most accurate and specific answer?

30
00:01:48.545 --> 00:01:51.690
Having strong Excel skills
will serve as a foundation for

31
00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.520
other tools you will learn and
use in the industry.

32
00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.440
If you took the first course,
Data Driven Decision Making,

33
00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.090
you will notice that this course is
structured a little differently.

34
00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.580
We're going to start every week with
an overview by my colleague, James Larmer.

35
00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.810
James will talk to you about
the topics for the upcoming week and

36
00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.820
give you some business context to consider
as you move into the lessons for the week.

37
00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.410
Other PwC professionals are going to
teach you a variety of Excel functions

38
00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.870
through recorded demonstrations.

39
00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.490
In most cases, you'll also get a chance to
practice the function you just learned.

40
00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.670
Periodically, we will have
scenario-based exercises

41
00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.909
that will combine several of
the topics you have learned.

42
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.710
This will give you a chance
to try out your new skills

43
00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.070
with your own Excel workbook.

44
00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.380
At the end of the course, there'll be a
final project that will give you a chance

45
00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.830
to combine everything you've
learned into one exercise and

46
00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.620
create your own Excel document to use for
analysis and problem solving.

47
00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.788
Here's how the course breaks down-

48
00:02:51.788 --> 00:02:56.040
In week 1, we're going to start off with
some basic navigation and functions and

49
00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.920
make sure everyone has the same
level of knowledge to build upon.

50
00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.720
In week 2, we'll focus on formulas and
on data cleansing.

51
00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.950
In week 3, we build on previous weeks
by exploring logic statements and

52
00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.000
learning how to build and
use pivot tables.

53
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.860
Finally, in week 4, you'll take a more
advanced look at some formulas and

54
00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.120
then pull it all together
in your final project.

55
00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.077
Having a solid understanding
of Excel has been a key

56
00:03:21.077 --> 00:03:22.890
component in my analytics career.

57
00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.168
Whether it has been validating data,
cleansing data, building mathematical or

58
00:03:27.168 --> 00:03:31.384
statistical models or more advanced
dashboards- Excel has been a powerful tool

59
00:03:31.384 --> 00:03:35.119
that has helped me better solve my
clients' most difficult problems,

60
00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:37.198
communicate results more effectively,

61
00:03:37.198 --> 00:03:40.846
and help my clients visualize the impact
of the solutions we've helped them

62
00:03:40.846 --> 00:03:41.360
develop.

63
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.370
We're sure you'll find this
course an insightful introduction

64
00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.640
to problem solving with Excel.

65
00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.396
We hope it will encourage you to
continue on with data analysis and

66
00:03:51.396 --> 00:03:52.776
presentation skills.

67
00:03:52.776 --> 00:03:56.952
The PwC approach, where you have
an opportunity to further develop and

68
00:03:56.952 --> 00:03:57.787
apply data and

69
00:03:57.787 --> 00:04:03.260
analytic skills to create visualizations
and make effective presentations.

70
00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.005
At the end of this course,
I will be back to give you a recap and

71
00:04:07.005 --> 00:04:08.627
to share my perspective.

72
00:04:08.627 --> 00:04:10.411
Thanks for joining us.

73
