[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.693 --> 00:00:10.239
In order to view and or edit a formula,
you can go to the relevant cell and

3
00:00:10.239 --> 00:00:15.522
double click or you can press F2
to open up the formula editing field.

4
00:00:15.522 --> 00:00:20.515
Any referenced cells within a formula
are highlighted using different colors.

5
00:00:20.515 --> 00:00:24.942
These colors are also used to show
the corresponding cell locations in

6
00:00:24.942 --> 00:00:25.773
the sheets.

7
00:00:25.773 --> 00:00:30.574
Sometimes, you may want to gain a better
understanding of how a formula is being

8
00:00:30.574 --> 00:00:36.145
calculated or if a complex formula is
not returning the expected results.

9
00:00:36.145 --> 00:00:41.107
This can be done by clicking on the
"Evaluate Formula" button that is located

10
00:00:41.107 --> 00:00:42.475
on the formula tab.

11
00:00:42.475 --> 00:00:47.407
Clicking this button will open up a prompt
that helps you walk through the formula

12
00:00:47.407 --> 00:00:48.299
step-by-step.

13
00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:52.530
Evaluate formula can be used to analyze
Excel workbooks that are send to

14
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.055
you by someone else or
it can be used well in developing and/or

15
00:00:56.055 --> 00:01:00.970
troubleshooting complex formulas
that have multiple components.

16
00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.924
For the second exercise, we are going
to use the "Evaluate Formula" option to

17
00:01:05.924 --> 00:01:09.235
help us evaluate the function
that we just typed.

18
00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:13.240
We start by clicking on
the formula in cell B21, and

19
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.411
then we select the "Evaluate Formula"
option from the Formula ribbon.

20
00:01:18.411 --> 00:01:22.449
As you can see, this opens up a pop-up
window that will let us evaluate

21
00:01:22.449 --> 00:01:25.540
the formula that is in the cell
that we just selected.

22
00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.285
We can step through the evaluation of that

23
00:01:29.285 --> 00:01:32.815
formula by clicking the Evaluate
button at the bottom.

24
00:01:32.815 --> 00:01:37.380
If so, we'll underline the part of the
formula that it is currently calculating.

25
00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.904
As we keep clicking through,
we will see how it's cell computes

26
00:01:43.904 --> 00:01:48.690
the different values and
end up with the final result of 25.

27
00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.165
Once we are done evaluating the formula,

28
00:01:51.165 --> 00:01:54.500
we click on the Close button
to close this pop up Window.

29
00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.736
To write a formula, we first need
to select the proper formula for

30
00:01:59.736 --> 00:02:00.823
this situation.

31
00:02:00.823 --> 00:02:03.952
If we do not know the exact
formula that is needed,

32
00:02:03.952 --> 00:02:07.600
we can find a series of
options on the formula bar.

33
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.221
If we open the Lookup and Reference bar,

34
00:02:10.221 --> 00:02:13.856
we get a series of formulas
that help us reference data.

35
00:02:13.856 --> 00:02:16.169
When we hold our mouse over a formula,

36
00:02:16.169 --> 00:02:20.140
Excel will give us a short
description of that formula.

37
00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.681
Excel has hundreds of functions that can
be combined to do countless operations.

38
00:02:25.681 --> 00:02:29.924
Even the most advanced Excel user is
constantly learning new formulas and

39
00:02:29.924 --> 00:02:31.335
new tricks.

40
00:02:31.335 --> 00:02:35.745
Excel will assist you in writing formulas,
but providing hints regarding

41
00:02:35.745 --> 00:02:40.651
the structure of the formula that you
selected, such as showing required inputs.

42
00:02:40.651 --> 00:02:44.691
Excel formulas have both mandatory and
optional fields.

43
00:02:44.691 --> 00:02:48.437
The optional fields will be
shown encompassed by brackets.

44
00:02:48.437 --> 00:02:51.277
If you are unsure about
the formula you are using,

45
00:02:51.277 --> 00:02:55.536
or how to construct it, you can use
the fx button which will walk you through

46
00:02:55.536 --> 00:02:58.114
the construction of that specific formula.

47
00:02:58.114 --> 00:03:02.075
Each formula has a unique logic that
has to be followed in order for

48
00:03:02.075 --> 00:03:05.170
the formula to calculate correctly.

49
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.582
Excel will prompt you if all
fields are not provided,

50
00:03:08.582 --> 00:03:10.920
or if fields are provided incorrectly.

51
00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.313
For the third exercise, we will be
looking into how Excel can help you

52
00:03:15.313 --> 00:03:18.818
construct a formula,
by providing various prompts.

53
00:03:21.142 --> 00:03:24.041
Let's start by clicking on cell B27 and

54
00:03:24.041 --> 00:03:27.205
pressing the equal sign
to start a formula.

55
00:03:28.225 --> 00:03:31.874
We're going to try out
the average function which is an

56
00:03:31.874 --> 00:03:36.646
Excel formula calculating the average
value of a set of data points.

57
00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.291
As you can see,
Excel recognizes the formula and

58
00:03:44.291 --> 00:03:48.605
tells us to enter at least one
value since this is mandatory.

59
00:03:48.605 --> 00:03:53.010
The additional values are optional
since they are encompassed by brackets.

60
00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.773
As you work within different sections of
the formula, the active section is bolded,

61
00:03:59.773 --> 00:04:03.656
I used this frequently when
trying to troubleshoot a formula.

62
00:04:03.656 --> 00:04:08.040
If I believe I am working on one
component of the formula but it's not

63
00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.190
the bolded section, then I know I'm
missing a comma or parenthesis somewhere.

64
00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.149
Here, let's try to calculate
the average of one and three.

65
00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:27.170
As you can see,
Excel tells us that this is equal to 2.

66
00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:31.724
If you want to see where the contents of
a cell are coming from you can navigate to

67
00:04:31.724 --> 00:04:35.850
the formula ribbon and
click on the Trace Precedents button.

68
00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:40.734
This will highlight all of the cells that are
being used in order to calculate the value

69
00:04:40.734 --> 00:04:42.847
in the cell that you are looking at.

70
00:04:42.847 --> 00:04:47.401
The Trace Dependence button, also under the
formula tab, will allow you to show any

71
00:04:47.401 --> 00:04:51.040
cells that are referencing the cell
that is currently selected.

72
00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.580
Both the Trace Precedence and
Trace Dependence buttons will show

73
00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:01.388
arrows on the sheets, showing you how
the data flows to one cell to the other.

74
00:05:01.388 --> 00:05:06.115
You can remove these arrows by clicking
on the remove arrows button that is also

75
00:05:06.115 --> 00:05:08.060
located under the formula tab.

76
00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:14.084
These functions become very helpful when
auditing someone else's spreadsheet or

77
00:05:14.084 --> 00:05:16.772
when error checking your own spreadsheet.

78
00:05:16.772 --> 00:05:19.132
For the fourth and final exercise,

79
00:05:19.132 --> 00:05:23.400
we will be looking into
Trace Precedence and Trace Dependence.

80
00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.953
Let's start by clicking cell B35.

81
00:05:26.953 --> 00:05:32.080
Now, we go up to the formula ribbon and
we select Trace Dependence.

82
00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:37.747
As you can see, there's now an arrow
pointing from cell B35 to cell

83
00:05:37.747 --> 00:05:45.286
C35 showing us that cell C35 is currently
referencing cells B35 in its calculations.

84
00:05:45.286 --> 00:05:47.772
Excel also allows us to Trace Precedence,

85
00:05:47.772 --> 00:05:51.370
showing us where a cell is
pulling it's value from.

86
00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:54.079
This is done by selecting cell C35 and

87
00:05:54.079 --> 00:05:58.936
then going up to the Formulas ribbon and
selecting Trace Precedents.

88
00:05:58.936 --> 00:06:03.808
As you can see, there are now
two arrows pointing from cell

89
00:06:03.808 --> 00:06:07.310
B35 as well as cell B36 to cell C35,

90
00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:13.337
Showing us that cell C35 is currently
referencing both number two and

91
00:06:13.337 --> 00:06:16.861
the number five and cell C35 and C36.

92
00:06:16.861 --> 00:06:20.720
Note that once you are done
Tracing Precedents and Dependents,

93
00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.280
there are arrows across the screen.

94
00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:27.903
You can remove these arrows by
clicking on the remove arrows

95
00:06:27.903 --> 00:06:30.315
button in the formula ribbon.

96
00:06:30.315 --> 00:06:36.541
