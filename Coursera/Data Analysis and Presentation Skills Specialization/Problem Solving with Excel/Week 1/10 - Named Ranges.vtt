2
00:00:06.882 --> 00:00:10.772
Let's move to our last topic
in this section, named ranges.

3
00:00:10.772 --> 00:00:16.806
A named range allows a user to
give an alias to a set of cells,

4
00:00:16.806 --> 00:00:20.087
a column, a row, or a dataset.

5
00:00:20.087 --> 00:00:23.070
This alias can be later referenced
in a formula or a function.

6
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.760
There are multiple
advantages to a named range.

7
00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.750
First of all, they make it very easy
to reference a specific dataset,

8
00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.110
instead of constantly switching tags or
moving around or across your sheet.

9
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.930
Plus, I don't normally think in rows and
columns.

10
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.649
So it's easier when reviewing a formula,
to review the named range,

11
00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.003
which can be growth rate,
instead of the actual row or column.

12
00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.411
Additionally, named ranges makes
the spreadsheet easier to audit,

13
00:00:51.411 --> 00:00:55.039
because the reader can read the name
of the cells instead of having to go

14
00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:57.210
track down the cells in the spreadsheet.

15
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.390
This means that you should always make
sure to pick a name that is clear,

16
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.040
concise, and self explanatory.

17
00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.250
Lastly, named ranges are useful
when copying formulas,

18
00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.100
since they do not require
any cell locking.

19
00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.780
The alias will always
refer to the same cell,

20
00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.659
even when you copy
the formula across the table.

21
00:01:18.703 --> 00:01:22.120
When naming ranges,
you cannot have spaces in your names.

22
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.560
This will result in an error.

23
00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.650
Additionally, a name that already
exists cannot be used again.

24
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.650
Existing named ranges can be
managed through the Name Manager,

25
00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.639
which can be found on the Formulas tab.

26
00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:39.710
Let's start by taking a look at the
dataset that we have been provided with.

27
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.604
As you can see, the table shows sales data
for distributor, country, and product.

28
00:01:46.604 --> 00:01:50.732
We also get information about the sales
channel, as well as the date sold.

29
00:01:52.592 --> 00:01:56.994
This data table will be used throughout
the rest of this section and the course.

30
00:01:58.832 --> 00:02:00.718
Since we will be using
this table going forward,

31
00:02:00.718 --> 00:02:03.556
it makes sense to start by creating
named ranges for the entire dataset.

32
00:02:03.556 --> 00:02:09.842
First, we're going to select the data that
we would like to create an alias for.

33
00:02:09.842 --> 00:02:11.570
So let's click on the top
left cell on the table.

34
00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.606
Now we can select all the cells
in the table using our mouse or

35
00:02:16.606 --> 00:02:22.370
by using Ctrl plus the arrows to
select all the way down to the right.

36
00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:28.660
So we'll do Ctrl and the right arrow,
and then Ctrl and then down arrow.

37
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.172
But there's an even better way to do this.

38
00:02:32.172 --> 00:02:36.102
The Ctrl+A is a shortcut that'll
select all of the cells within

39
00:02:36.102 --> 00:02:40.200
the table automatically,
which is exactly what we want to do here.

40
00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.640
At the top of the page, on the left side,
you will find the name box.

41
00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:52.120
This is where Excel shows you which
cell in your sheet you are currently on.

42
00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.540
But it can also be used
to create a named range.

43
00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.720
Since we have selected sales data,

44
00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.550
that's what we were going
to call the named range.

45
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:08.208
So let's type that in the name box and
press Enter.

46
00:03:08.208 --> 00:03:14.091
Now, if we go back and reselect the entire
table once more using the Ctrl+A,

47
00:03:14.091 --> 00:03:20.534
we will see that Excel now recognizes the
selected data as being named Sales_Data.

48
00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:27.180
Let's create another named range, this
time for the revenue that is in column L.

49
00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.685
We start by selecting the first
value in the column, and then using

50
00:03:31.685 --> 00:03:36.848
the Shift+Ctrl+arrow down shortcut to
select all the data in the column.

51
00:03:36.848 --> 00:03:39.719
Instead of naming this
range using the name box,

52
00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:43.654
we're going to use the Define Names
option under the Formula table.

53
00:03:43.654 --> 00:03:48.046
If we select the Define Names option,
a pop-up appears prompting us for

54
00:03:48.046 --> 00:03:50.600
the alias that we want to use.

55
00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:56.726
Since we selected the revenue,
let's call this range Sales_Revenue.

56
00:03:58.124 --> 00:04:02.858
Under the same tab,
you'll find the Name Manager option.

57
00:04:02.858 --> 00:04:08.055
This is used to create a new named range,
to edit the cells that the named range is

58
00:04:08.055 --> 00:04:13.430
referring to, to change the name that is
being used for, and to delete a named range.

59
00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:20.140
Let's use the Name Manager to
create another named range,

60
00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:24.347
this time for
quantity of products that were sold.

61
00:04:24.347 --> 00:04:29.228
So we clicked on New, and
another pop-up window opens,

62
00:04:29.228 --> 00:04:33.208
asking us what we want
to call our named range.

63
00:04:33.208 --> 00:04:36.460
Let's call this one Quantity_Sold.

64
00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.710
Next, we are prompted to select
the cells that are going to be named.

65
00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:52.890
Here, this is the data in column J,
so let's go ahead and select it.

66
00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:54.350
Once we're done with that,
we can press OK.

67
00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:01.117
And that named range is
created successfully.

68
00:05:01.117 --> 00:05:02.486
Now that we know how to
create named ranges,

69
00:05:02.486 --> 00:05:03.681
let's take a look at how you use them.

70
00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.720
Let's say we want to calculate
the total revenue for this data sheet.

71
00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:14.430
In order to do so, we're going to want
to sum all the records in column L.

72
00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:18.147
We just created a named range for
this data.

73
00:05:18.147 --> 00:05:22.514
So we're going to use that in our sum
function instead of selecting the cells

74
00:05:22.514 --> 00:05:23.223
manually.

75
00:05:23.223 --> 00:05:24.934
Let's start by typing our sum formula.

76
00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:32.830
And then inside our sum formula,
we're going to type out sales.

77
00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:38.819
And while we do this,
we see that a prompt comes up asking us

78
00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:43.490
if by any chance we are looking for
Sales_Data or Sales_Revenue.

79
00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:47.160
We're going to select the Sales_Revenue,

80
00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.690
since that is the named
range we are looking for.

81
00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:53.794
And you can select this by hitting Tab or
selecting it with your mouse.

82
00:05:53.794 --> 00:05:58.960
So now it's your turn to practice
named ranges with exercise 1B.

83
00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.200
Note that you may need to
create additional named ranges

84
00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.140
to answer certain questions.

85
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:08.052
