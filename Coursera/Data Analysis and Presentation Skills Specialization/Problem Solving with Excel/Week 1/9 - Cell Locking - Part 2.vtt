00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.210
Let's practice some
more with cell locking.

2
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.340
In this exercise,
we're going to be

3
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.040
asked to complete
a multiplication matrix.

4
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.705
Let's start with the first row.

5
00:00:15.705 --> 00:00:21.175
We know that it's going to
be the one in cell F39,

6
00:00:21.175 --> 00:00:24.000
multiplied by the values
in the table header.

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.245
The first cell is easy.

8
00:00:25.245 --> 00:00:27.060
But now, we would like to be able

9
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.965
to copy this formula
to the right.

10
00:00:28.965 --> 00:00:30.465
In order to be able to do so,

11
00:00:30.465 --> 00:00:32.745
we need to lock our
values correctly.

12
00:00:32.745 --> 00:00:34.830
So if we think it
through we would like to

13
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.265
lock the column for cell F39.

14
00:00:38.265 --> 00:00:41.250
Since we do not want to
cell to increment that,

15
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.420
so we select cell F39 within

16
00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.855
the formula and press
F4 to lock this out.

17
00:00:47.855 --> 00:00:49.190
Now, we can copy

18
00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.650
the formula and paste
it out the right way.

19
00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.410
As we can see, we're
getting the right results.

20
00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.495
We still need to fill out
the rest of the table.

21
00:00:59.495 --> 00:01:01.760
So let's go back to
the formula in the first cell.

22
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.000
In order for us to be able
to copy this formula down,

23
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.685
we will need to do some
additional cell locking.

24
00:01:07.685 --> 00:01:09.770
First of all, we want to make

25
00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.150
sure that we always

26
00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.340
reference the values
in the table header.

27
00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.910
Now let's go ahead and
lock down those using F4.

28
00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.170
Now, if we were to simply
walk down the entire cell,

29
00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.685
we'll always be using
the one in G38,

30
00:01:23.685 --> 00:01:25.560
which is not what we want.

31
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.965
Instead, we want to make sure

32
00:01:27.965 --> 00:01:30.340
that we lock the row
but not the column,

33
00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.880
we do this by pressing F4
once more and we see how

34
00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.115
the dollar sign is now only

35
00:01:37.115 --> 00:01:38.465
in front of the row number

36
00:01:38.465 --> 00:01:39.830
and not in front of the column.

37
00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.980
This means that the column
will increase if we copy

38
00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.465
the formula but the row
will always be row 38.

39
00:01:47.465 --> 00:01:49.775
You may have realized
we're going to have

40
00:01:49.775 --> 00:01:52.190
to do the same thing with
the reference to the values

41
00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.289
in column F. If we
keep the formula

42
00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:57.190
the way it is now and
copy it across the table,

43
00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.570
we would always be multiplying

44
00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.140
values by the one in cell F39,

45
00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.350
which wouldn't get us the
results that we're looking for.

46
00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.750
So let's go and tweak

47
00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.680
cell locking we
applied previously by

48
00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.100
selecting F39 and pressing F4

49
00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.020
twice until we see

50
00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.920
a dollar sign in front
of the column header.

51
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.905
Now, the formula is ready to go.

52
00:02:20.905 --> 00:02:22.150
So let's copy it,

53
00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.870
then pasting across the
entire multiplication matrix,

54
00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.540
as you can see, we are

55
00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.630
getting the expected
multiplication results.
