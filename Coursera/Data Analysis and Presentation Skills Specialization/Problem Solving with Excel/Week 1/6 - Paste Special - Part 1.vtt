2
00:00:10.857 --> 00:00:13.756
In this section,
we will be reviewing some of the tools that

3
00:00:13.756 --> 00:00:16.255
are the core building blocks for
working within Excel.

4
00:00:16.255 --> 00:00:18.448
The first topic is
going to be Paste special,

5
00:00:18.448 --> 00:00:20.151
the second is Cell locking,

6
00:00:20.151 --> 00:00:23.123
and the last topic is Named ranges.

7
00:00:23.123 --> 00:00:24.740
Let's start with Paste special.

8
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.750
As the name indicates, this is a function
that allows you to copy and paste.

9
00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.860
Now I'm sure you are all familiar with
the standard copy an paste feature

10
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.140
across many programs.

11
00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.030
In Excel and many Microsoft products this
can be done by clicking Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V.

12
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.460
The paste special function
is very similar to this.

13
00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.970
So there are a lot of different
Paste Special options available.

14
00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:51.330
The most commonly used options are Paste
Formula, Paste Values, and Paste Format.

15
00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:56.270
You can also manipulate the content you
are pasting by pasting using operations

16
00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.830
such as multiply, transform, divide and
well as several other functions.

17
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:06.490
Paste Special is useful when you receive
large amounts of data that require

18
00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.920
cleaning before you can go and analyze it.

19
00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.710
It can also help you complete
quick calculations or

20
00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.460
enhance the speed in which you format.

21
00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.230
Let's take a look how Paste Special works.

22
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.310
First, we select the cell that
we want to copy and

23
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.270
then we press Ctrl+C to copy
the content of that cell.

24
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.520
In order to bring up the Paste Special
menu, we now navigate to the Home tab,

25
00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.420
on the ribbon at the top of our screen.

26
00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.880
This is in the left top
corner of your screen.

27
00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.570
And then at the Home tab,
we select the Paste button.

28
00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.200
By clicking on the little arrow below,

29
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.480
we get a drop down menu presenting some
of the more commonly used Paste options.

30
00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.220
We were looking for Paste Special,

31
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.707
so let's go ahead and click on
the last item in the drop-down menu.

32
00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.680
As you can see,
this brings up a pop-up window with

33
00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.210
the various Paste Special options
such as formula, values, formats.

34
00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.840
And there's also others such as multiply,
divide, and transpose.

35
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.360
Once you select which option you want to
use you can press OK to paste the content.

36
00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:10.990
So there's also a shortcut for

37
00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.560
Paste Special which allows you to pull
down the same menu we just navigated to.

38
00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.110
Let's select our cell again and
press Ctrl+C to copy the content and

39
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.632
then to get the Paste Special shortcut we

40
00:02:24.632 --> 00:02:29.530
hold Ctrl+Alt+V in sequence to
bring up the Paste Special menu.

41
00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.140
We will be using this
shortcut going forward.

42
00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.200
Now that we've seen how to pull
up the Paste Special menu,

43
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.930
let's practice using it.

44
00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.150
In exercise 1A, we are asked to
paste the values of a data set.

45
00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.895
Now if we try to do it using Ctrl+C and
Ctrl+V,

46
00:02:44.895 --> 00:02:47.810
we see that, we get zero and
not the 20 that we are copying.

47
00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:49.760
Why is this?

48
00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.685
Well, if we go back to
the value that we are copying.

49
00:02:52.685 --> 00:02:54.875
And press F2 to step into the cell.

50
00:02:54.875 --> 00:02:57.085
You'll see that the cell
contains a formula.

51
00:02:57.085 --> 00:03:00.005
When you copy a cell in Excel,
it does not copy the values, but

52
00:03:00.005 --> 00:03:01.075
it copies the formulas.

53
00:03:02.365 --> 00:03:05.727
Second, the formulas are built
with the relative references.

54
00:03:05.727 --> 00:03:08.647
So if you copy and and
paste the cell two rows over and

55
00:03:08.647 --> 00:03:11.747
three rows down, the reference
will all move in the same manner.

56
00:03:11.747 --> 00:03:13.687
We will explore how to control this later.

57
00:03:13.687 --> 00:03:16.147
But in our example,
we're looking to copy just the values.

58
00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.600
If we go back to our copied values and

59
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.250
press F2 to look at the formula,
we will see that the cell

60
00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.920
is multiplying the number 2 in
cell F10 with the 0 in cell G9.

61
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.580
Hence, our result of 0.

62
00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.600
So let's take a look at how
Paste Special can help in this scenario.

63
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.930
As we want to only copy
the content values of the cell.

64
00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.050
First, we select the values
we want to copy.

65
00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.200
Here, that's D10 through D13.

66
00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.140
Now we press Ctrl+C to copy these values,
and

67
00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.400
then we move over cell G10 where we
would like to paste these values.

68
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.869
Let's bring up the Paste Special
menu using this shortcut Ctrl+Alt+V,

69
00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:55.360
and then we want to paste the values.

70
00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.630
So we go ahead and
select the Values pop-up menu,

71
00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.670
and now we press OK.

72
00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.680
As you can see this copies
the correct values to the table.

73
00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.030
This is helpful when you're
manipulating data and

74
00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.140
want to make a quick calculation just
using the values not the formulas.

75
00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.395
However note that as a best
practice you should avoid

76
00:04:13.395 --> 00:04:17.165
hard-coding data in
a model for doing your analysis.

77
00:04:17.165 --> 00:04:18.725
Now let's try pasting formats.

78
00:04:18.725 --> 00:04:22.205
Frequently, we want to copy just
the format into corner of the cell, and

79
00:04:22.205 --> 00:04:24.435
not the underlying formulated values.

80
00:04:24.435 --> 00:04:28.315
Similarly to what we did before, we start
by copying the cells we want to use.

81
00:04:28.315 --> 00:04:31.125
This is D18 through D21.

82
00:04:31.125 --> 00:04:35.310
Next, we select the cell we
want to copy the formats into.

83
00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.890
And then we bring up the Paste Special
menu using our Ctrl+Alt+V shortcut.

84
00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.471
And since we're trying to paste a format,
we go ahead and

85
00:04:44.471 --> 00:04:47.620
select Paste Formats pop-up
on the Paste Special menu.

86
00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.860
As you see the format is
correctly pasted over.

87
00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:55.150
Now we also have another way to accomplish
this, and this is called Format Painter,

88
00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.090
does a similar task as
the Paste Special formats option.

89
00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.298
So let's press Ctrl+Z to undo
the formatting we just did using

90
00:05:01.298 --> 00:05:02.155
Paste Special.

91
00:05:02.155 --> 00:05:04.911
We start by selecting the format we want
to use by clicking on the first cell

92
00:05:04.911 --> 00:05:05.450
in the table.

93
00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:09.410
We select the format painter
option on the home tab.

94
00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:11.373
Let's select it and then we go and

95
00:05:11.373 --> 00:05:14.539
highlight the cells we want
to paste the format into.

96
00:05:16.014 --> 00:05:18.510
As you can see this
correctly pastes the format.

97
00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.725
So last but not least for
our Paste Special options right now.

98
00:05:23.725 --> 00:05:25.705
We're going to look at pasting a formula.

99
00:05:25.705 --> 00:05:28.330
This becomes pretty handy when
we want to use the same or

100
00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.835
similar formula that is already used
somewhere else in our workbook.

101
00:05:31.835 --> 00:05:35.945
But we don't want to copy the formatting
from the source location.

102
00:05:35.945 --> 00:05:41.395
Once more,
we copy the cells we want to use.

103
00:05:41.395 --> 00:05:45.290
Here is the cell D26
through D29 using Ctrl+C.

104
00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:51.054
Next we select the cell we want
to paste the formulas into and

105
00:05:51.054 --> 00:05:56.960
then we bring up the Paste Special
menu using Ctrl+Alt+V.

106
00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.274
We're trying to paste the formulas so

107
00:05:58.274 --> 00:06:01.340
let's select that option in the menu and
press OK.

108
00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:07.370
As you can see, the formulas are Pasted
and the results are a multiplication,

109
00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:10.490
of the values in Column F,
and a 10, in row 25.

110
00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:16.830
Now it's your turn to practice
Paste Special, with Exercise 1B.

111
00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:20.520
Paste the content using the different
options in the Paste Special menu.

112
00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:25.322
And remember, the shortcut is Ctrl+Alt+V.

113
00:06:25.322 --> 00:06:28.837
[SOUND]
