2
00:00:04.894 --> 00:00:09.269
Now we're going to show you how to use 
two more advanced Paste Special functions.

3
00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.621
First we'll look at Multiply,
then we'll look at Transpose.

4
00:00:12.621 --> 00:00:16.580
If we take a look at the data table
that is provided for this exercise,

5
00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.610
we notice that the signs have been
entered incorrectly for revenue and

6
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:21.788
cost of goods sold.

7
00:00:21.788 --> 00:00:27.092
This happens often when working in
the accounting industry.

8
00:00:27.092 --> 00:00:30.360
It's important to
always pay attention to the data

9
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.150
that you are providing to make sure that
the results make sense and are logical.

10
00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.944
So we can go in and
change the signs of the values manually.

11
00:00:38.944 --> 00:00:43.132
But that can become quite tedious, and
it's also increasing the risk of manual

12
00:00:43.132 --> 00:00:46.940
errors, which affect our spreadsheet and
final answers.

13
00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.780
Instead, we're going to use
the Paste Special option

14
00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.570
to change the signs in row 77.

15
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.857
Notice how there's a -1 in cell I80.

16
00:00:54.857 --> 00:00:59.777
We're going to use this -1 and
Paste Special to multiply the revenue and

17
00:00:59.777 --> 00:01:02.000
COGS by -1 to change the sign.

18
00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.800
Let's start by selecting cell I80 and
pressing Ctrl+C.

19
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.475
Now, we want to change
the signs in rows 76 and 77.

20
00:01:12.475 --> 00:01:15.074
So let's go and select those cells, and

21
00:01:15.074 --> 00:01:18.844
then bring up the Paste Special
menu using Ctrl+Alt+V.

22
00:01:18.844 --> 00:01:23.420
Now, we want to multiply, so let's select
that option in the menu and press OK.

23
00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.248
As you can see, your revenue and
cost of goods sold signs switch, and

24
00:01:27.248 --> 00:01:28.996
you've now changed the sign.

25
00:01:28.996 --> 00:01:32.343
Paste Special Multiply functionality
is definitely useful when

26
00:01:32.343 --> 00:01:35.394
you need to make a quick change
like this to a large dataset.

27
00:01:35.394 --> 00:01:38.583
Instead of going in manually and
changing the values,

28
00:01:38.583 --> 00:01:43.790
this helps you do it much quicker, and
you also avoid the risk of manual errors.

29
00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.002
Now, let's look at the Transpose
option on the Paste Special menu.

30
00:01:48.002 --> 00:01:51.111
A lot of times,
when you're trying to manipulate data and

31
00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:55.800
change the layout of a table, you want to
switch the rows and columns around.

32
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.030
The leading practice is to use
the Transpose option to do so.

33
00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.390
First, we select the data that
we're looking to transpose.

34
00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.640
Here, that is the months in column C.

35
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.305
Next, we copy these cells using Ctrl+C.

36
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.305
We select the cells where we
want to paste these months.

37
00:02:13.305 --> 00:02:18.880
Then we bring up the Paste Special Menu
using Ctrl+Alt+V.

38
00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.291
We want to transpose the values,
so let's select Transpose and

39
00:02:23.291 --> 00:02:27.060
Values on the Paste Special menu,
and then select OK.
