00:00:10.508 --> 00:00:13.701
The VLookup is one of
the core functions in Excel,

3
00:00:13.701 --> 00:00:15.770
and one of the most frequently used.

4
00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.882
The VLookup allows you to look up
a value in a data table and

5
00:00:19.882 --> 00:00:25.123
pull a specific attribute corresponding
to that value, to a new table.

6
00:00:25.123 --> 00:00:29.500
For example, let's say I have
a data set with a name on it.

7
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.280
Now imagine I also have a data set
that started with the same name,

8
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.340
followed by a series of
attributes related to that name.

9
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.330
VLookup is going to allow me to lookup
the name in the second data set,

10
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.960
and then select which attribute or

11
00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.620
attributes I'm interested in
pulling into my new data set.

12
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.980
VLookup's work best in
structured data sets,

13
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.400
and your lookups range always needs to
be all the way to the left of the table.

14
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.980
The V in VLookups stands for vertical.

15
00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.590
There's a separate formula called HLookup
which stand for horizontal lookup.

16
00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.620
Which allows you to lookup
the data horizontally.

17
00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.480
Where the vertical lookup, the VLookup,
looks vertically across the selection.

18
00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.870
Generally, we see VLookups
more frequently than HLookups

19
00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.560
due to the way data is
normally structured.

20
00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.700
However, HLookup is a good
tool to have in your pocket.

21
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.060
The syntax for
VLookup is fairly straightforward.

22
00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.270
It starts with a lookup value.

23
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.820
Essentially, what am I trying to lookup?

24
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.470
The next input is the table array.

25
00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.230
Where am I trying to
lookup this information?

26
00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.410
And next, is the column index number.

27
00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.190
How many columns from the matching
value do I want to look over and

28
00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:46.260
bring into my data set?

29
00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:51.640
The last piece in brackets is an optional
field called the range_lookup.

30
00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.860
This is asking whether I want
an exact match, or a partial match.

31
00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.710
Most of the time we want an exact match,

32
00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.220
but it is a leading
practice to specify true or

33
00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.900
false, something we need to be
sensitive to as we go forward.

34
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.720
Some other things to keep in mind are the
VLookup is always going to take the first

35
00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.130
match that it finds in the data set.

36
00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.370
It stops looking once it
finds a corresponding match,

37
00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.060
even though there may be multiple
matches further down.

38
00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.110
Second, if Excel cannot find a match,
it is going to come back with an error.

39
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.690
We will learn how to deal
with both of these problems

40
00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.620
as we become more familiar and
we practice using the VLookup.

41
00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.010
So, let's now shift actually
playing with VLookup within Excel.

42
00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.500
Why don't we start with
basic VLookup problem?

43
00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.410
First, let's get familiar
with our data set,

44
00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.500
and the question we
are being asked to answer.

45
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.300
Over here we have a very basic table,
starting with distributor ID,

46
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.050
the distributor country,
and the distributor name.

47
00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.380
Down here we have another table
with just the distributor ID.

48
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.020
The first question asks us to
match the distributor's name

49
00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.840
to the distributor's ID.

50
00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.590
This is a perfect use case for a VLookup.

51
00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:09.840
So why don't we get started.

52
00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.340
To begin we are going to move into
the cell where we want to work.

53
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.626
And as discussed prior,

54
00:03:17.626 --> 00:03:22.131
we are going to start writing our
formula plucketing the equals key.

55
00:03:22.131 --> 00:03:26.483
Now we are going to start typing the name
of the formula which is VLookup.

56
00:03:26.483 --> 00:03:30.601
I am going to hit the tab key which
will fill out the rest of the formula.

57
00:03:30.601 --> 00:03:35.430
You will notice that within the VLookup
formula, the lookup value is folded.

58
00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.850
This allows me to know which section
of the formula I'm working in.

59
00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.460
The view with the value I
want is the distributor ID,

60
00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:48.660
since I'm trying to pull in corresponding
information with the distributor ID

61
00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.150
being the common key.

62
00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:58.570
I'm going to select 23265,
the first distributor ID, and hit comma.

63
00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:03.190
Next, I'm going to select where I want
Excel to look up this information.

64
00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:08.520
I'm going to select my entire data table
from the top left to the bottom right.

65
00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.350
As discussed in the basic
functionality section

66
00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.240
we're going to want to lock these cells so
it's easier to copy the formula.

67
00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:19.800
If we are copying and

68
00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:23.790
pasting this formula, we'd like to
keep the data table consistent,

69
00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:29.250
so I'm going to hit the F4 key to get the
$ sign next to both the row reference and

70
00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:30.880
the column reference.

71
00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.400
Next, I'm going to click comma, and

72
00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.580
it's asking me to insert what column
index number I am looking for.

73
00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:38.840
In other words,

74
00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.550
how many columns over is the data
that I want to pull into my table?

75
00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.170
Starting with the data
that was being lookedup.

76
00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:48.720
The distributor ID will be in column one.

77
00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.470
The country in column two and
the name in column three.

78
00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.820
For this example I want column three
as that is where the name resides.

79
00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:03.095
Now, I'm going to hit comma to move
to the next piece of this syntax,

80
00:05:03.095 --> 00:05:05.554
which is range_lookup.

81
00:05:05.554 --> 00:05:10.380
The range_lookup is an approximate
match or an exact match.

82
00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.030
The best practice is
generally doing an exact match.

83
00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.870
So I'm going to type false and
then close the formula.

84
00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:24.140
You will see that the answer is
Uriel Benton after I hit Enter.

85
00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:28.454
Note, this matches a name for
the distributor ID in B21.

86
00:05:28.454 --> 00:05:33.385
Since we properly locked and
anchored the formula, we can copy and

87
00:05:33.385 --> 00:05:38.680
paste down the formula to get
the matching distributor to 23315.

88
00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.187
Let's look to see what happens
when we copy and paste.

89
00:05:42.187 --> 00:05:46.827
We will see Anika Tillman appeared for

90
00:05:46.827 --> 00:05:50.599
distributor ID 23315.

91
00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:56.717
