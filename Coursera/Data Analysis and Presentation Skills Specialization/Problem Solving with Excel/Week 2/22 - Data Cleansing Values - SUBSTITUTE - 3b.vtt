00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.010
In problem 3b, we
can see another use

2
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.705
of the substitute function.

3
00:00:09.705 --> 00:00:11.970
You've been asked to
create a table for

4
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.925
2015 and 2016 cost data,

5
00:00:14.925 --> 00:00:16.740
and we already have
the same list for

6
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.405
sales data in
the previous two years.

7
00:00:19.405 --> 00:00:23.100
Using the data on the left
and the substitute formula,

8
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.295
we can create a new list
in the right-hand column.

9
00:00:26.295 --> 00:00:29.355
To do this, I'll type equals,

10
00:00:29.355 --> 00:00:34.050
substitute, and open parentheses,

11
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.440
and I'll reference
the first cell in our table.

12
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.900
Next, we type the field
which we would

13
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.750
like to change, which is 2013,

14
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.140
and remember to put
that as quotes as

15
00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.725
it's stored as a text
in the other table,

16
00:00:47.725 --> 00:00:49.950
and then type comma.

17
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.190
Then, we'll type the field

18
00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:53.900
which we want to
replace that with,

19
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.120
which is 2015, and again,

20
00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.965
I'll put that in quotes.

21
00:00:57.965 --> 00:01:01.430
I'll close the parentheses
and hit "Enter".

22
00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.450
This formula will only work
with our first four lines as

23
00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:09.740
the rest are for 2014 and
needs to be replaced to 2016.

24
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.795
I'll still copy down the formula

25
00:01:11.795 --> 00:01:14.790
which is the first line for 2014.

26
00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.730
Now, I'll go in and
change 2013 to 2014,

27
00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.975
and change 2015 to 2016,

28
00:01:24.975 --> 00:01:26.780
and I'll copy down the formula

29
00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.370
for the remainder of the cells.
