2
00:00:05.369 --> 00:00:08.086
The final section of text
functions is data validation.

3
00:00:08.086 --> 00:00:09.903
Data Validation is a tool,

4
00:00:09.903 --> 00:00:14.980
that allows the user to limit potential
inputs during data entry.

5
00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.480
Data Validation ensures that all
data entered within the defined cell

6
00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.950
matches the validation criteria
that was previously defined.

7
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:24.840
And if it doesn't,
Excel will return an error.

8
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:30.380
Restricting input criteria helps ensure
data quality, and reduce the risk for

9
00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.800
potential formula errors, and limits the
need for data cleansing prior to analysis.

10
00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.460
Data validation can be found under
the data tab of the Excel ribbon.

11
00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:47.010
If we navigate to this tab, and
select data validation, a pop-up

12
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.960
appears, showing us the different Data
Validation options that are available.

13
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.439
Using this toolbox, we can define what
type of data we want to restrict,

14
00:00:58.439 --> 00:01:00.368
a specific cell arranged to.

15
00:01:00.368 --> 00:01:02.471
There are several options provided.

16
00:01:02.471 --> 00:01:07.040
For example, whole numbers between 0 and
100 or dates within the last year.

17
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.970
The input message tab gives us the ability
to define a custom message that appears

18
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.060
when someone clicks on the cell range
that the data validation applies to.

19
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.558
This can be used to give the user some
additional details around what type of

20
00:01:20.558 --> 00:01:22.356
data is allowed in a cell range.

21
00:01:22.356 --> 00:01:27.273
The error alert tab allows us to define
an error message that is displayed when

22
00:01:27.273 --> 00:01:32.192
a user tries to enter data into the cell
range that is outside the pre-defined

23
00:01:32.192 --> 00:01:34.044
data validation criteria.

24
00:01:34.044 --> 00:01:37.840
We're going to walk through an example of
how to use Data Validation functionality

25
00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.440
to ensure data standardization in a table.

26
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.850
As any data analysis can attest,
data fields can be highly variable,

27
00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:46.950
if they're not controlled.

28
00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.365
For example, when a user is asked
to provide a state they can

29
00:01:50.365 --> 00:01:55.215
assume they need to provide the full state
name, the first two letters of the state,

30
00:01:55.215 --> 00:01:58.106
the postal zip code, or
the state abbreviation.

31
00:01:58.106 --> 00:02:01.606
In our example,
we're going to rebuild the table,

32
00:02:01.606 --> 00:02:07.023
using Data Validation to ensure the column
input criteria is standardized so

33
00:02:07.023 --> 00:02:09.871
that it can be used for future analysis.

34
00:02:09.871 --> 00:02:15.339
First, we go to cell B30,
and select B30 through B36.

35
00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:20.171
Then, we navigate to the ribbon,
and select Data Validation,

36
00:02:20.171 --> 00:02:25.458
in Settings, select Date under Allow,
since we are entering a date.

37
00:02:25.458 --> 00:02:30.365
Next, we wanted to find,
a range of possible inputs, so

38
00:02:30.365 --> 00:02:33.446
let's select the between option.

39
00:02:33.446 --> 00:02:38.505
We will define the start date as =B16,
which is cell B16,

40
00:02:38.505 --> 00:02:43.672
because this was the earliest
starting date in our sample data.

41
00:02:43.672 --> 00:02:48.950
And we will define the end date as =B14,
that's cell B14,

42
00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:55.480
since this was the latest date,
that items result. Next, select OK.

43
00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.470
Next, we will work with
the Months Sold column.

44
00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.283
Months range from 1 to 12 in
the standard calendar, and

45
00:03:02.283 --> 00:03:06.210
are rarely represented as decimals,
or fractions.

46
00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:09.210
Therefore, we're going to restrict
the values that represent

47
00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.850
months on the whole
numbers between 1 and 12.

48
00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:18.590
In order to do this, let's start by
selecting cells C30 through C36.

49
00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:24.625
Then, we navigate to the Data tab on
the ribbon, and select Data Validation.

50
00:03:24.625 --> 00:03:30.740
In Settings, we're going to select whole
number, and under Allow, we'll put 1

51
00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:39.270
as the first allowable input, and 12,
as the highest allow input, click OK.

52
00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:46.253
In order to standardize the unit price, we
start by selecting, cell E30 through E36.

53
00:03:46.253 --> 00:03:51.080
Then we navigate to the Data tab on
the ribbon, and select Data Validation.

54
00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.649
In Settings, we're going to select List,
under Allow.

55
00:03:55.649 --> 00:04:01.240
And as a source, let's enter in 14.50,

56
00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.850
9.99, and 9.00,

57
00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:07.450
Because, these are our unit price options.

58
00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:11.411
Additionally, we can
create a list in Excel and

59
00:04:11.411 --> 00:04:15.330
highlight this list in the store
section of the Data Validation.

60
00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:23.738
For this problem, let's now change
the source to equals H30: H32.

61
00:04:23.738 --> 00:04:29.433
You can also do this by selecting and
highlighting H30, through H32.

62
00:04:29.433 --> 00:04:34.979
Let's also navigate to the Error Alert
tab on the Data Validation pop up,

63
00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:41.090
because we want to add an error message if
our user inputs a non-valid unit price.

64
00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:46.020
In the input message,
let's type invalid unit price and

65
00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.650
in the title enter unit price, click OK.

66
00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.790
Last but not least,
let's look at the Revenue column.

67
00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:55.912
We start by selecting
cell F30 through F36 and

68
00:04:55.912 --> 00:05:01.725
then we navigate to the Data tab on
the ribbon and select Data Validation.

69
00:05:01.725 --> 00:05:07.320
In Settings, we're going to select
Decimal under Allow, because our

70
00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:12.400
total revenue is in US dollars and cents,
which all contain two decimal places.

71
00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:17.089
We note that the minimum cell value is
$1,000 which goes along with our minimum

72
00:05:17.089 --> 00:05:18.949
sales quantity of 100 units.

73
00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:25.324
So we'll restrict inputs to values
greater than 1,000, click OK.

74
00:05:25.324 --> 00:05:28.141
Great job completing data validation for
this table.

75
00:05:28.141 --> 00:05:32.942
Before moving on to completing problem 1B,
take some time to test your

76
00:05:32.942 --> 00:05:38.318
Data Validation criteria, and enter in
values in this Data Validation table.

77
00:05:38.318 --> 00:05:42.525
Notice, when you enter a unit
price that is not on our list,

78
00:05:42.525 --> 00:05:44.554
we receive the input error.

79
00:05:44.554 --> 00:05:49.811
