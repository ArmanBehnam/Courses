2
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.895
Welcome to week two.

3
00:00:12.895 --> 00:00:16.357
I trust that you've worked your way
through the lessons in week one and

4
00:00:16.357 --> 00:00:20.183
can see the value that building your
Excel skills could have for your career.

5
00:00:20.183 --> 00:00:23.678
Understanding formulas and other functions
will help you get your work done

6
00:00:23.678 --> 00:00:26.040
faster and frankly,
just make it more enjoyable.

7
00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.650
This week, we're going to take the skills
you learn in week one and build upon them

8
00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.770
by using VLOOKUP to search for
values based on a formula that you built.

9
00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.700
Then we're going to take a look at a very
important set of functions we like to

10
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:39.979
called data cleansing.

11
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.540
Preparing a data, making sure it's
accurate and making sure it's ready for

12
00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.130
analysis is probably one of
the most important steps any

13
00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:49.870
of us can do analytics.

14
00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.550
We will share with you some
approaches to make that easier.

15
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.022
We'll then moving into increasing
your ability to use text functions

16
00:00:57.022 --> 00:00:57.526
within Excel.

17
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.490
Once again we'll finish out the week with
an on your own practice and exercises.

18
00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.060
This week's lessons will dynamically
increase your ability to

19
00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.900
leverage Excel as a tool for
analysis and problem solving.

20
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.550
As we build towards the following weeks,

21
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.300
remember to refer back to
the principles we gave you in week one.

22
00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.970
How are you keeping those
principles in mind as you learn?

23
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.160
It can be easy to be overwhelmed
by a complex analytical problem.

24
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.190
By following some of the principles we
have discussed, for example, breaking down

25
00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:36.650
complex problems, you'll be able to
methodically work towards the solution.

26
00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.401
Once again my colleagues are going to
guide you through the demonstrations and

27
00:01:40.401 --> 00:01:42.343
exercises and I'll be back next week.

28
00:01:42.343 --> 00:01:49.310
