2
00:00:04.824 --> 00:00:09.525
For problem 1b, we're going to use
the dataset which we have used a few times

3
00:00:09.525 --> 00:00:11.680
throughout this course.

4
00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.820
If we go to the data tab we can
see that the sales data set.

5
00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:22.995
If we highlight the entire
table from C14 to L121,

6
00:00:22.995 --> 00:00:28.050
you will notice on the top left
the reference changes to sales data

7
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.720
telling us that the entire
table is a named range.

8
00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:33.500
Now, let's go back to the exercise.

9
00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.330
We start by typing =VLOOKUP in C31.

10
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.650
The look up value is going to
be the distributor ID in B31.

11
00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.670
Next we want to select
the look up array so

12
00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.010
let's bring up the name manager using F3.

13
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.300
We just found out that the sales
data table is called SALES_DATA so

14
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.980
let's select it and click OK.

15
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:01.790
I don't need to lock it,

16
00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:07.000
because a named range is always going to
be referencing the same series of cells.

17
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.080
When I hit comma, Excel prompts me for
the column number,

18
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.590
and we already know from counting this
before, the information is in column five,

19
00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.144
so we enter a 5.

20
00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.750
Next we'll hit comma, and
then since we are looking for

21
00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.840
an exact match,
we finish the formula with a false.

22
00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.620
Close the paren and hit Enter.

23
00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.680
Now I can just copy this formula down and

24
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.745
you will see how all
the answers are filled out.

25
00:01:39.745 --> 00:01:45.960
Note that this formula is very easy
to read, thanks to the name range.

26
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.840
Let's hit F2 to open up the formula.

27
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.050
As you can see it is asking to find the
value that is in B34 within my sales data.

28
00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.940
And grab the corresponding
field in the fifth column.

29
00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.360
Now, it's your turn to
practice with Problem 1c.

30
00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.200
To give you a hint,
remember from our introduction

31
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.590
that the unique ID needs to
always be in the far left column.

32
00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:12.090
Good luck.

33
00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:22.090
