00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.490
The last data
cleansing exercise we

2
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.010
will cover together
is de-duplicating.

3
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.510
This is a little different than

4
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.040
the past functions we covered,

5
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.870
because it is not a typed formula

6
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.940
that can reference our raw data.

7
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.060
As mentioned before, it is
a leading practice to keep

8
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.470
your raw data separate from

9
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.630
anything that you are
manually editing.

10
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.550
You can do this by just copying

11
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.245
and pasting into a separate tab,

12
00:00:28.245 --> 00:00:29.640
or workbook in Excel,

13
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.950
and clearly labeling that data.

14
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.470
In this dataset, we have
been informed that there

15
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.810
may be an erroneous
duplicate entries.

16
00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.150
To care this, first
I'm just going to

17
00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.250
copy and paste
the table to the right,

18
00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.320
so we have the original data

19
00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.880
and our edited data separate.

20
00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.520
I'll denote the table
on the left as raw,

21
00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.900
and the table on the right as

22
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.695
edits made for our reference.

23
00:01:02.695 --> 00:01:06.010
I'll select the table
on the right,

24
00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.210
and click the "Data"
ribbon above,

25
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.995
and then click
"Remove Duplicates".

26
00:01:11.995 --> 00:01:14.060
In the example we know that there

27
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.020
are identical duplicate entries,

28
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.505
so it's okay to keep all rows
checked and click "OK".

29
00:01:19.505 --> 00:01:21.740
If we are reviewing
a dataset with

30
00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.170
only two fields that
made up the primary key,

31
00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.020
we can select one or two
of the columns and it will

32
00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.070
ensure that we don't have

33
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.980
any duplicate values
on that primary key.

34
00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:32.915
However, if you do this,

35
00:01:32.915 --> 00:01:34.460
keep in mind that
Excel will choose

36
00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.830
the first instance
of the primary key,

37
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.510
and everything after including

38
00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.060
the extra columns
will be deleted.

39
00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.465
We can see that all duplicates
were found and deleted,

40
00:01:44.465 --> 00:01:46.280
so we have only unique rows

41
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.050
remaining in the table
on our right.
