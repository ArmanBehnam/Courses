00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:07.470
In problem 3A,
we're going to take

2
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:08.940
the trim function one step

3
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.290
further by using

4
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.395
the substitute function
together with it.

5
00:00:13.395 --> 00:00:15.360
Here in this data,

6
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.190
we have commas separating some of

7
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.840
our numbers where we would like

8
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.140
decimal points or periods.

9
00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.710
At the same time,

10
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.450
we still have
extra spaces that we

11
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:26.820
talked about in
the last exercise.

12
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.520
The substitute function
allows us to change

13
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.060
specific characters and
replace them with another.

14
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.650
I'll start by typing the trim
function equals trim

15
00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.290
open parentheses and I'll

16
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.870
nest the substitute
function into that,

17
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.405
so I'll type substitute.

18
00:00:45.405 --> 00:00:47.450
That prompts us to choose

19
00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.240
the cell with text that
we'd like to replace.

20
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.630
So I'll reference
the first cell in our table.

21
00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:55.520
The next reference is

22
00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.785
the old text we would
like to replace,

23
00:00:57.785 --> 00:01:02.300
so I'll type open quote
comma close quote.

24
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.280
Notice that I put the comma

25
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.595
within quotes because
it's a text value.

26
00:01:06.595 --> 00:01:09.530
All text values within
a formula string needs to

27
00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.905
be separated from
the formula with quotes.

28
00:01:12.905 --> 00:01:14.720
So next, I will enter

29
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.200
the substitute tests in
this example which is a period,

30
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.930
so I'll type quote
period and quote.

31
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.880
Next, I'll close the parentheses,

32
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.000
click Enter, and I'll drag

33
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.400
down the formulas
to our other cells.

34
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.195
Again, I'll click the menu
and fill without formatting

35
00:01:35.195 --> 00:01:36.950
to ensure that
our format stays the

36
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.560
same as it was
before in our table.

37
00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.410
You might be wondering
why we wouldn't just use

38
00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:43.580
the find and replace

39
00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.385
function that's located
in the home button.

40
00:01:46.385 --> 00:01:48.980
The reason is because it's always

41
00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.580
important to keep
your raw data intact,

42
00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.290
especially if you have
to do a lot of clean up.

43
00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.600
If you have issues
further down the line,

44
00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.970
you may want to look back
at the original data to

45
00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.560
check or you may need

46
00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.140
evidence of what you
originally received.

47
00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.030
If you start making changes and

48
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.100
edits directly to
your original data,

49
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.750
it is extremely difficult to

50
00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.445
ensure that nothing
has been changed

51
00:02:10.445 --> 00:02:14.360
accidentally or there may be
instances where you need to

52
00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.490
check if the issue
was with the raw data

53
00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.520
received or the
computations done to it.

54
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.430
Therefore it is
a leading practice to use

55
00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.040
the reference functions that
we've learned together to

56
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.500
clean and edit your data
especially when you're

57
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.020
dealing with sensitive
or large data sets.
