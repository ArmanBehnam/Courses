00:00:12.322 --> 00:00:16.241
Today we're going to work with text
functions which help us manipulate data

3
00:00:16.241 --> 00:00:17.883
to give us a better analysis and

4
00:00:17.883 --> 00:00:20.803
better understanding of
the actual underlying data.

5
00:00:20.803 --> 00:00:25.477
So, when you do receive a data dump from a
client, it's usually pretty unstructured,

6
00:00:25.477 --> 00:00:29.519
because sometimes its systems aren't
formatted in a fashion that is easy to

7
00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.520
analyze, especially in Excel, and
there also are other programs.

8
00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.001
So we use these text cleaning functions to
set up our data so that we can actually do

9
00:00:38.001 --> 00:00:42.110
an in-depth analysis and
our formulas do work down the line.

10
00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.680
You'll find out things like vlookup and
pivot tables and

11
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.450
other functions where your
data does need to really be in

12
00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.280
a clean fashion in order to be
able to analyze it effectively.

13
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.830
In this section, we will be discussing how
to cleanse your data using text functions.

14
00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:01.490
As discussed throughout the course,

15
00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:06.350
it's important to clean up the data set
before starting any type of analysis since

16
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.000
there might be issues within the data that
could generate noise and false results.

17
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.740
We're going to focus on
how to manipulate and

18
00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.570
alter text within a data set using
a number of different text functions.

19
00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.950
Text functions allow you to modify,
manipulate and

20
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.100
search text data in order to increase
the utility of your data in Excel.

21
00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.450
Let's start with the RIGHT function.

22
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.040
This function allows you to extract
a substring from a text string starting at

23
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.770
the end of the text string and selecting
the defined number of characters.

24
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.540
The RIGHT function requires a text string and
a number as inputs.

25
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.799
For example, if I provide it with a cell
containing the word Hello and the number

26
00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:53.390
2, Excel will return the L and the O,
the last two characters of the word.

27
00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.431
Note that the RIGHT function, just like
every other text function we're covering

28
00:01:57.431 --> 00:01:59.310
today, counts spaces as a character.

29
00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.080
The RIGHT function can be combined with
other text functions that we will be

30
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:10.360
discussing later on in the section to
extract specific parts of the text string.

31
00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.950
Our next function is the LEFT function.

32
00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.100
And as expected, it works similar
to the RIGHT function, except that

33
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.570
instead of selecting the characters
starting at the end of the word,

34
00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.700
this function starts at the beginning.

35
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.770
The LEFT function also requires
a text string and a number as inputs.

36
00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.490
Let's practice the RIGHT function.

37
00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:36.999
As we see, we have been given a set of
product IDs that are all structured

38
00:02:36.999 --> 00:02:42.355
the same way, two letters,
followed by a dash, followed by number.

39
00:02:42.355 --> 00:02:47.232
We are being asked to extract the last
four characters of these product

40
00:02:47.232 --> 00:02:49.390
IDs using the right function.

41
00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.153
We usually see problems like these when we
receive a numerical string that contains

42
00:02:55.153 --> 00:02:57.620
multiple sets of identical information.

43
00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.770
For example, in a bank account number,
which contains the routing information for

44
00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.770
the bank as well as
the actual account number.

45
00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.168
By using the RIGHT formula,
we can extract parts of the identified

46
00:03:09.168 --> 00:03:12.709
information in order to run
an analysis on that data.

47
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.228
So let's get started.

48
00:03:16.228 --> 00:03:22.130
As you can see, the RIGHT function
requires a text string as its first input.

49
00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.060
Here, that's going to be
the product ID in column B.

50
00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.920
The next input is the number of
characters that we would like to select.

51
00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:35.762
Here, we know that all
the product IDs have four

52
00:03:35.762 --> 00:03:40.495
numbers at the end,
hence we want to extract the last

53
00:03:40.495 --> 00:03:45.242
four characters of our text string,
so we enter 4.

54
00:03:45.242 --> 00:03:46.061
As you can see,

55
00:03:46.061 --> 00:03:50.170
this formula successfully extracted
the last four digits of the product ID.

56
00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.740
Now, let's copy the formula down the rest
of the rows to finish this exercise.

57
00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.772
Now it's your turn to try the LEFT and
RIGHT text functions.

58
00:04:00.772 --> 00:04:05.103
We will continue to build off these two
as we continue throughout the rest of

59
00:04:05.103 --> 00:04:08.006
the section, so
let's get a start on exercise B.

60
00:04:08.006 --> 00:04:13.521
