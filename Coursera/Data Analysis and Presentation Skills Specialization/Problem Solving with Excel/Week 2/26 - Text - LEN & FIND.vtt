2
00:00:04.905 --> 00:00:06.511
In this second exercise,

3
00:00:06.511 --> 00:00:10.600
we are being asked to look up
the digits within the the product IDs.

4
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.400
Similar to the previous exercise,

5
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.230
we're going to need to find the position
of the dash within the product ID so that

6
00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.500
we can use the right function to select
the desired number of characters.

7
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.730
But since the right function starts
selecting characters from the end of

8
00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.540
the word, we're going to need to
calculate the position of the dash,

9
00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.030
starting from the end of the word,
as well.

10
00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:36.190
This is a simple equation, as long as we
know the total length of the text strings.

11
00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.890
Fortunately, we already went over
a formula that can give us that,

12
00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.350
the length of the text string.

13
00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.440
So first we're going to use
the LEN function to calculate

14
00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.310
the length of the product ID.

15
00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:53.800
So let's type =LEN, and
now we select the product ID in column B.

16
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.920
As you can see, the first product
ID has nine characters in total.

17
00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.430
And the dash is in the fifth
position starting from the left.

18
00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.710
This means that dash is also in the fifth
position starting from the right

19
00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.610
since 9 minus 5 plus 1 equals 5.

20
00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.920
Now that we know in what position the dash
is found starting from the end of

21
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.530
the product ID, we can use a right
function to select a digit.

22
00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.596
We're still using Product ID in Column B,
so let's first select that cell.

23
00:01:25.464 --> 00:01:29.790
Now we need to provide the number of
characters we would like to select.

24
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.890
We know that this is going to be the
number or characters in the Product ID,

25
00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.860
minus the position of the dash,
starting from the left, plus 1.

26
00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.080
But, we also know from the previous
exercise that we need to subtract 1

27
00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.950
from this number, since we only want
to select digits, and not the dash.

28
00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.910
So the final number of characters is
going to be the number of characters,

29
00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:54.730
which can be found in column D,

30
00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.180
minus the position of the dash
which can be found in column C.

31
00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:04.010
Now, if we press Enter, we can see that
our formula returns the correct answer.

32
00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.570
So we can copy now,
the remaining product IDs to the rest.

33
00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:13.990
Now that we know how to separate the IDs
using multiple columns and formulas,

34
00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.920
we're going to try to combine that entire
operation into one concise formula.

35
00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.550
We will follow the exact same logic
as before, but nest the formulas.

36
00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.620
We start by writing out our right.

37
00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.070
Now, we are still looking up
characters in the product ID

38
00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:34.021
that can be found in Column D,
so that's easy.

39
00:02:34.021 --> 00:02:38.640
Next, we need to provide the number of
characters that we want to extract.

40
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.590
So, remember that's from what we just did.

41
00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.680
It's going to be the total number
of characters in the product ID,

42
00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.446
minus the position of the dash.

43
00:02:47.446 --> 00:02:54.565
So here we enter LENV33, since this will
give us the length of the product ID,

44
00:02:54.565 --> 00:03:00.430
minus FIND, like we did before,
the dash within the product ID.

45
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.120
Once we make sure we have the appropriate
amount of closing parentheses,

46
00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.900
we press Enter, and we see the condensed
formula gives us the same answer.

47
00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.620
Now it's your turn to practice FIND,
LEN, and MID with exercise 2B,

48
00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.154
where you're going to be given with
a dataset with phone numbers, and

49
00:03:19.154 --> 00:03:21.458
asked to extract things
like the area code.

50
00:03:21.458 --> 00:03:27.824
