2
00:00:05.633 --> 00:00:08.825
The next tool we're going to
look at is the Trim function.

3
00:00:08.825 --> 00:00:14.269
Here in Problem 2a we have rows of data
that represent pharmaceutical products.

4
00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:18.206
You'll notice that there are extra
spaces in-between the letters and

5
00:00:18.206 --> 00:00:19.394
numbers in the data.

6
00:00:19.394 --> 00:00:25.070
The trim function will strip extra spaces
from text, leaving only single spaces

7
00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.923
between words and no space characters
at the start or end of the text.

8
00:00:29.923 --> 00:00:35.917
So I'll type in the equal sign,
trim, open parentheses and

9
00:00:35.917 --> 00:00:40.395
reference the first cell
in the table above.

10
00:00:40.395 --> 00:00:44.844
You'll notice that the formula prompts
us to enter text within the parentheses,

11
00:00:44.844 --> 00:00:48.887
but we can also reference another
cell that has text in it.

12
00:00:48.887 --> 00:00:52.441
I'll close the parentheses and
click Enter,

13
00:00:52.441 --> 00:00:58.066
and you can see that the name was
returned without any extra spaces.

14
00:00:58.066 --> 00:00:59.777
As in our previous example,

15
00:00:59.777 --> 00:01:03.781
I'll drag down the formula using
the bottom right-hand corner,

16
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.954
and I'll click the Menu to
Fill Without Formatting.

17
00:01:09.954 --> 00:01:12.916
Notice that all the extra
spaces are removed.

18
00:01:12.916 --> 00:01:16.795
This can be very helpful when
using any lookup functions.

19
00:01:16.795 --> 00:01:21.758
As we are normally working with an exact
match, one extra space can make

20
00:01:21.758 --> 00:01:26.236
something that appears the same
to actually not return a match.

21
00:01:26.236 --> 00:01:32.521
