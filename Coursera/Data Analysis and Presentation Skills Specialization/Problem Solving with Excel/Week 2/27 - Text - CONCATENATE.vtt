2
00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:08.750
You can also use text functions
to reformat text strings.

3
00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:13.660
There are three main functions with this
purpose, PROPER(), UPPER(), and LOWER().

4
00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.820
The PROPER() function takes a text string,
adds input, and

5
00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.340
returns properly formatted text,
where the first letter is capitalized and

6
00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.400
all other characters in
the word are set to lowercase.

7
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.757
The UPPER() function also takes
a text string and inputs and

8
00:00:28.757 --> 00:00:31.369
returns uppercase formatted text.

9
00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.059
Similarly, the LOWER() function
takes a text string as input and

10
00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:37.010
returns lowercase formated text.

11
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.620
These three text functions are useful
to fix capitalization issues

12
00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.070
within a data set and
to create consistent records.

13
00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.160
Another highly useful text function
is the CONCATENATE() function,

14
00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:57.140
as suggested by the name, it concatenates
strings of a text to create a new,

15
00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.190
and larger, text string.

16
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.480
The CONCATENATE() function takes
multiple text strings and inputs, and

17
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.240
returns one single text string.

18
00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.462
For example, if we were to
CONCATENATE() Hello and World,

19
00:01:11.462 --> 00:01:16.145
the concatenate function would
return the text string HelloWorld.

20
00:01:16.145 --> 00:01:18.107
Let's try out the formatting function, and

21
00:01:18.107 --> 00:01:21.280
the CONCATENATE() function
we just discussed.

22
00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.150
In our first exercise, we have been given
the data set with a list of cities and

23
00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.150
their respective countries.

24
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.220
We noticed that the countries
have been properly capitalized,

25
00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.170
however the cities are all in uppercase.

26
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.750
So we're going to start by
using the PROPER() function to

27
00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.110
reformat the text in column B.

28
00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.727
In order to do this, we type =PROPER(,

29
00:01:46.727 --> 00:01:52.030
and then we select the city in column B.

30
00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.608
If we press Enter,
we can see that this function

31
00:01:55.608 --> 00:02:00.361
returns the city name with only
the first letter capitalized.

32
00:02:00.361 --> 00:02:04.500
Next we want to combine the city and
the country into a single string of text.

33
00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.490
So we're going to use the CONCATENATE()
function to accomplish this.

34
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.744
So let's start by typing =CONCATENATE(,

35
00:02:14.744 --> 00:02:19.837
the first text string we
want to use is the city,

36
00:02:19.837 --> 00:02:25.597
which can be found in column B,
but also in column D.

37
00:02:25.597 --> 00:02:29.263
Now, since we went through
all that trouble to

38
00:02:29.263 --> 00:02:34.069
properly format the city names,
we're going to use column D.

39
00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:39.019
Next, we add a text string with a comma,
and a space,

40
00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:44.629
to separate the city and
the country within the text string.

41
00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:49.567
Don't forget to use quotes to let
Excel know that this is a text string.

42
00:02:49.567 --> 00:02:54.392
Last, we're going to select
the country name from column C,

43
00:02:54.392 --> 00:02:57.106
and then close the parenthesis.

44
00:02:57.106 --> 00:03:03.450
Upon pressing Enter, we can see
that this returns a correct string,

45
00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.518
so we can copy it down to the rest
of the table, Now it's your

46
00:03:08.518 --> 00:03:15.243
turn to practice text formatting and
CONCATENATE() with exercise 1B,

47
00:03:15.243 --> 00:03:19.194
where you're given
a dataset with first and

48
00:03:19.194 --> 00:03:24.655
last names that need to be formatted and
then concatenated.

49
00:03:24.655 --> 00:03:26.615
