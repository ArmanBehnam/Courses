00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.970
The next issue in

2
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.865
raw data is also very common
when pulling data from

3
00:00:08.865 --> 00:00:10.410
other sources and then

4
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.990
combining the data
into an Excel sheet.

5
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.720
We can see here that
Excel has flagged

6
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.300
the top chart with
little green triangles.

7
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.875
When you click on a cell,

8
00:00:19.875 --> 00:00:21.795
the error sign will pop up.

9
00:00:21.795 --> 00:00:23.940
By clicking on that error sign,

10
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.320
we can see that this number
is actually stored as text.

11
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.225
In the arrow menu,

12
00:00:30.225 --> 00:00:31.800
we have the function there to

13
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.185
convert the cells to
numbers one by one.

14
00:00:34.185 --> 00:00:36.210
If a number is not
stored as a number,

15
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.550
we cannot use some of
our most common functions

16
00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.385
in the data such
as sum or average.

17
00:00:41.385 --> 00:00:44.560
In this example, we
have a sum function at

18
00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.020
the bottom of our table but
it is returning a zero.

19
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.310
Also, lookup functions
will not recognize that

20
00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:52.930
the text version of number

21
00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.395
10 is the same as
the numerical version of 10.

22
00:00:56.395 --> 00:00:59.195
So we will not return a match.

23
00:00:59.195 --> 00:01:02.710
Now, we'll learn
two easy ways to convert

24
00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.655
the data to numbers for
a large set of data all at once.

25
00:01:06.655 --> 00:01:10.225
The first way to do this
is the value function.

26
00:01:10.225 --> 00:01:13.925
To do this, type
equal sign value,

27
00:01:13.925 --> 00:01:17.680
open parentheses, and
reference the cell which

28
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.435
we would like to show as a value.

29
00:01:19.435 --> 00:01:22.255
I'll close the parentheses
and click Enter.

30
00:01:22.255 --> 00:01:24.355
You can see now
that we don't have

31
00:01:24.355 --> 00:01:25.840
the little green arrow or

32
00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.475
any errors coming up from Excel.

33
00:01:28.475 --> 00:01:30.465
I'll drag down the formula.

34
00:01:30.465 --> 00:01:32.750
Only copy formulas to ensure that

35
00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.000
our table's format stays intact.

36
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.910
Now, you can see that
the sum function is working.

37
00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.870
The second way to
fix this problem is

38
00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:43.880
using something we've
already covered,

39
00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.040
the text to columns function.

40
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.080
As a reminder to do this,

41
00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.955
we'll select the raw data,

42
00:01:49.955 --> 00:01:52.040
click into the data ribbon

43
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.380
and click the text
to columns button.

44
00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.270
We can keep the file type as

45
00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.655
delimited here and click Next.

46
00:01:58.655 --> 00:02:01.340
I'm just going to
uncheck these options as

47
00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.115
we are only working with
one row in our example.

48
00:02:04.115 --> 00:02:05.870
The text to columns function

49
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:07.330
knows that these are numbers.

50
00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.245
You can see that general

51
00:02:09.245 --> 00:02:12.165
converts numeric
values to numbers,

52
00:02:12.165 --> 00:02:13.795
date values two dates,

53
00:02:13.795 --> 00:02:17.120
and all remaining values to text.

54
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.810
I will choose to insert
the values in our table that we

55
00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.280
have down below and click finish.

56
00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.890
It's a good check to see that

57
00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.720
our sum worked in
this table as well.
