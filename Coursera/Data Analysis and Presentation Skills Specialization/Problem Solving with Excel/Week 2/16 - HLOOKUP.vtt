2
00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:09.830
We are now going to practice the HLookup,
the Horizontal Lookup.

3
00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.970
As mentioned in the introduction there
are two types of lookup functions.

4
00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:17.320
The HLookup or Horizontal Lookup and
the VLookup for

5
00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.560
Vertical Lookup, which
we already practiced.

6
00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.710
If you look at the data table associated
with this exercise, you will notice that

7
00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.740
the headers are running along the top and
then the reference data is located below.

8
00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.080
The information we are trying to
look up this time is weight and

9
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.650
shoe size associated with
the patient information.

10
00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.930
This is a perfect use case for

11
00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.800
a horizontal look up as we want to look
up the information in the second row,

12
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.090
which is were the distributor
ID is located.

13
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.680
In C70, I'm going to type =(HLOOKUP 
open parenthese

14
00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.600
The reference value wait from B70.

15
00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.590
I will hit comma and

16
00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.530
select the table array,
which is found in cells B66 to G67,

17
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.330
we're going to lock the table array, so
we can copy and paste the formula later.

18
00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:18.580
The data we want to look up is on
the second row, so I'll enter a 2.

19
00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.579
Once again, this is not an approximate
match so we will type false,

20
00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.710
we end up with an answer
of 125 pounds as expected.

21
00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.270
We can now copy the formula down to
get the value for shoe size as well.

22
00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.580
Please now practice on
your own using problem 2b.

23
00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.740
Notice that the information for Malawi and
Malaysia are on different rows.

24
00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.325
So we may need to adjust our formula
when copying and pasting it.

25
00:01:51.325 --> 00:01:57.862
