00:00:06.043 --> 00:00:10.834
Problem 1b shows another example of
a common data problem when receiving

3
00:00:10.834 --> 00:00:11.536
raw data.

4
00:00:11.536 --> 00:00:13.691
Here we have first name, last name,

5
00:00:13.691 --> 00:00:17.530
email and employee level, all
separated by an underscore symbol.

6
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.350
This underscore symbol is called our
delimiter, which is the name for

7
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.180
the common symbol that is
separating our data fields.

8
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.040
Many computer programs export
their data in this way,

9
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.410
as they don't have the same
column setup as Excel.

10
00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.710
One of the most frequent
extracts we see is the CDL,

11
00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.070
which is the common delimited file,

12
00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.490
which is a simple text extract
with all data separated by commas.

13
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.487
This file type can drastically shrink
file size on a database extract,

14
00:00:50.487 --> 00:00:53.658
but it is impossible to
work with on it's own.

15
00:00:53.658 --> 00:00:57.495
To fix this issue we're
going to highlight the data,

16
00:00:57.495 --> 00:01:01.270
click into the data ribbon, and
then click the text to columns button.

17
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.180
This tool will allow us to change our
text strings into easy to use columns.

18
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.745
Since we have each field
separated by an underscore,

19
00:01:11.745 --> 00:01:15.166
I will choose the delimited option and
click Next.

20
00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:20.530
Frequently in scanned data
the delimination may be fixed width.

21
00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.920
This would be when the data is
separated in visual columns,

22
00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.180
rather than using a symbol to specify
the breaks like in this example.

23
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.020
This screen shows that our
delimiter is defaulted as Tab and

24
00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.280
there are other standard options
such as a semi colon or comma.

25
00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.918
Since the delimiter is
the underscore in this data,

26
00:01:40.918 --> 00:01:44.286
I will check off Other and
type in an underscore.

27
00:01:44.286 --> 00:01:47.500
The Preview function here is
extremely useful to see if your

28
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.373
data looks correctly separated.

29
00:01:49.373 --> 00:01:52.575
I'm going to hit Next and
here we have some more options such

30
00:01:52.575 --> 00:01:56.050
as formatting the data in each column or
choosing not to import.

31
00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.540
I'd like to make sure our end result
is underneath the question, so

32
00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.643
I'm going to edit the destination.

33
00:02:05.643 --> 00:02:09.688
Once I do that, now I can click Finish.

34
00:02:09.688 --> 00:02:13.981
Now we have the separated
data in a nice chart.

35
00:02:13.981 --> 00:02:18.355
