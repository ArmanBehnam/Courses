2
00:00:05.979 --> 00:00:09.060
As discussed in the introduction,
INDEX MATCH

3
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:14.270
can be used to look up information in
a grid with both an X and Y variable.

4
00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:16.960
We will utilize the optional
column reference

5
00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.010
which we have previously defaulted
to one in prior exercises.

6
00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.380
Let's look at our new data set
to get better understanding of

7
00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:25.600
why this would be useful.

8
00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:33.380
Our data set has names across the top,
and personal identification going down.

9
00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.810
This would mean the names would
be an X input or column input,

10
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:41.670
and the personal identifiers would
be the Y input or row input.

11
00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.670
In this exercise, we are looking for
personal information about Rod.

12
00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.870
Why don't we first look up where in
the data set the information for Rod is.

13
00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.670
We're going to start
with the MATCH formula.

14
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.430
So let's do =MATCH,
followed by the lookup value.

15
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.861
Here it is, his name.

16
00:01:02.347 --> 00:01:07.440
We are going to lock this cell, because
it's the same for all the attributes.

17
00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.150
The lookup array is a list of names
across the top in our data set.

18
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.000
You'll see that the name
range inserted itself.

19
00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.300
And we will use a match type of 0,
as we're looking for an exact match.

20
00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:25.912
If we hit Enter,

21
00:01:25.912 --> 00:01:30.524
we find out that Rod's information is
in the fourth column of the data set.

22
00:01:32.137 --> 00:01:36.515
And now we can copy and paste our
formula down the remaining attributes,

23
00:01:36.515 --> 00:01:39.840
since Rod will be in the fourth column for
all answers.

24
00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.160
Now we're going to use the MATCH formula
to look up where the eye color is,

25
00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.870
in the personal attribute field.

26
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.200
We are going to search for
eye color using MATCH.

27
00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.650
Lookup value is going to be eye color,

28
00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.450
and our data set is going to
be the personal information.

29
00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.120
The name range pops up, and
the MATCH type will be exact.

30
00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.160
Ensure to lock the rows and
columns where required.

31
00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.100
I find that many formula issues
are a result of missed cell locking.

32
00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.400
If we copy this down for each cell,
it's telling us what position,

33
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.340
weight, height, sex, and
eye color are located in.

34
00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.120
We can combine both the x and
y MATCH in an index formula to find

35
00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.176
the corresponding x and y coordinates for
Rod's personal information.

36
00:02:33.176 --> 00:02:40.770
We will do =index, and
this time we select the entire data set.

37
00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.090
We need to select the entire data set
since, we're going to utilize both the row

38
00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.710
and column lookup, and need the entire
range of outcomes to work with.

39
00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:54.340
Let's start at B38 and select down to

40
00:02:57.555 --> 00:02:58.055
I44.

41
00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:05.560
I'm going to lock the data we just
selected as we've done throughout this

42
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:11.280
exercise, so
it does not shift on me when I copy it.

43
00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.850
Now I am looking at the row number.

44
00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.491
We already looked up the row number for
eye color in D147,

45
00:03:18.491 --> 00:03:20.790
so let's input that here.

46
00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:26.160
Similarly, the column number
can be found in C147.

47
00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.250
If I close the formula,
hit Enter, we get brown.

48
00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:39.400
Now, if I copy this down, we now have
Rod's eye color, sex, height, and weight.

49
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.510
We just created a look up
formula utilizing two variables,

50
00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.200
however used three formulas.

51
00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:50.340
Just like before, we do not need
to do this in two separate steps.

52
00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.740
We can do this all at once
by replacing the row and

53
00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:58.580
column inputs with the match formula
that we wrote in columns C and D.

54
00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.328
Let's start by typing =index,

55
00:04:04.871 --> 00:04:06.140
and select our data set,

56
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.880
making sure to lock it.

57
00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:13.330
For the row number,

58
00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.412
we are going to use the match
formula we were working with before.

59
00:04:17.412 --> 00:04:24.200
The lookup value is going to be eye color
that is saved within the personal info,

60
00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.770
and the match type is exact.

61
00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:33.750
We close the first match with
the parenthesis, and then hit comma.

62
00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.440
Notice that Excel is now asking us for
the column number.

63
00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.910
We are going to do the same thing we did
before to look up Rod's column position.

64
00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.470
We will use MATCH again,

65
00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.740
but this time, we are looking for Rod.

66
00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.430
This reference is anchored, so we're
going to lock both the row number and

67
00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.230
column so it doesn't shift on us.

68
00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.440
The lookup array is name,

69
00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:04.800
and the match is exact.

70
00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.590
We close the second match,
and then we close the index

71
00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:10.320
and hit Enter.

72
00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.360
We have an eye color of brown,

73
00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.260
which matches the answer we got
when we did it in two parts.

74
00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:20.271
If we copy this down,
we now have all of Rod-

75
00:05:24.821 --> 00:05:27.513
picking up both the x and y variable.

76
00:05:27.513 --> 00:05:31.836
We just built a two variable
lookup in one single formula.

77
00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:36.690
Now it's your turn to
try in problem seven.

78
00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:41.500
Use an INDEX MATCH MATCH to write
a single formula that will pick up

79
00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.250
not only the personal attribute,
but also the person's name,

80
00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:49.813
and find the matching information
using the same data set and formula.

81
00:05:49.813 --> 00:05:51.356
Good luck.

82
00:05:51.356 --> 00:05:57.896
