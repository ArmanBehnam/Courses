2
00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:10.162
Let's extend our understanding
of these statistical methods to

3
00:00:10.162 --> 00:00:14.520
develop a forecast of website visits
based on social media mentions.

4
00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.886
A scatter plot simply plots each
observation of our two variables,

5
00:00:20.886 --> 00:00:25.037
social media mentions and
website visits, on a chart,

6
00:00:25.037 --> 00:00:30.602
with social media mentions,
our independent variable, on the x-axis,

7
00:00:30.602 --> 00:00:36.220
and website visits,
our dependent variable, on the y-axis.

8
00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:37.630
It's a simple chart, and

9
00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.296
forms the basis of our simple
linear regression-based forecast.

10
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.630
Let's create the plot now by selecting
both columns of the dataset.

11
00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:54.060
Next, we'll click the Insert tab on
the ribbon and click the scatter icon.

12
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.540
From the list of scatter plot options,
let's select the first plot.

13
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.520
Excellent, let's cut the chart and paste
it back in our problem working sheet.

14
00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.210
Let's also resize it slightly.

15
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.560
Now let's add a few elements to our
chart which will assist in our forecast.

16
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.515
First, let's add a linear trendline.

17
00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.130
This linear trendline is the result
of linear regression on the dataset.

18
00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.440
We will do this by clicking on the chart,

19
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.488
and then clicking the Design
tab on the ribbon.

20
00:01:31.488 --> 00:01:35.843
Next, we'll click Add Chart Element and

21
00:01:35.843 --> 00:01:41.030
select Trendline from the dropdown menu.

22
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.510
Lastly, we'll select linear
to add a linear trendline or

23
00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.300
regression plot to the chart.

24
00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.990
We see now that Excel
has drawn a trendline

25
00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.860
across the scatter plot of our data.

26
00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.260
This is the best fit line, or

27
00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:04.640
the line which minimizes the distance from
it to each of the data points, on average.

28
00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.820
Let's pause for a moment and
observe the trend.

29
00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.820
Consistent with what we've
calculated in problem number 1A,

30
00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.020
we see that, in general,

31
00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.580
increases in social media mentions
result in increase web sites visits.

32
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.790
We know this because the trendline
is sloping upward to the right.

33
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.340
If we knew the equation of this trendline,
we could further describe the average

34
00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.450
relationship between social media
mentions and website visits.

35
00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.090
Excel makes this simple for
us to calculate and display on the chart.

36
00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.140
Let's right-click on the trendline and
select format trendline.

37
00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:56.229
In the format pane, click the checkboxes
next to Display Equation on chart,

38
00:02:56.229 --> 00:03:00.386
and also Display R-squared value on chart.

39
00:03:00.386 --> 00:03:04.640
You'll notice that this matches
the R-squared value that we previously

40
00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:05.470
calculated.

41
00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.360
Let's explore the equation of
the trendline to better understand

42
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.840
the relationship between social
media mentions and website visits.

43
00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:20.510
Notice that the y-value is our
dependent variable, website visits,

44
00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:26.190
and that the x-value is our independent
variable, social media mentions.

45
00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:33.610
We can read this equation then as for
every 1x, or social media mention,

46
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.750
we observe 23 website visits,
plus some additional constant value,

47
00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.980
which is not directly explained by
increases in social media mentions.

48
00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.700
This constant value may be the number of
website visits we receive due to other

49
00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:48.600
marketing efforts.

50
00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.740
With approximately 23 visits for
every social media mention,

51
00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:58.830
it would seem prudent for us to focus some
of our marketing efforts on social media.

52
00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.210
Does this all seem a bit familiar?

53
00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:02.480
It should.

54
00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.530
You'll recall from algebra
that the 23 in our equation

55
00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.650
is the slope of the trendline.

56
00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.150
If we want to calculate the slope of
the trendline without creating a chart,

57
00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.500
Excel offers its slope function.

58
00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.650
Slope requires two parameters,
in this case,

59
00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:20.815
the value of our two
variables in our dataset.

60
00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:26.390
It's important to note that
slope requires the known y's,

61
00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:29.920
in our case, website visits,
as its first parameter.

62
00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:34.200
Let's parameterize slope with website
visits and social media mentions, and

63
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.600
set it to work.

64
00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.460
We see that we've calculated the same
slope as the trendline equation above.

65
00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.400
Isn't that great?

66
00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.560
Remember the constant value
in the equation above?

67
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.670
This is the intercept of the trendline.

68
00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:53.555
Said differently, this can be thought of
as the website visits we would obtain

69
00:04:53.555 --> 00:05:00.170
with 0 social media mentions, as it is the
value of the equation when we set x to 0.

70
00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:04.152
We can calculate the intercept
using Excel's intercept function.

71
00:05:04.152 --> 00:05:08.517
Similar to slope, intercept requires
website visits as its first parameter,

72
00:05:08.517 --> 00:05:10.870
with social media mentions as its second.

73
00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:16.027
Let's set it to work and calculate
the intercepts, or constant term,

74
00:05:16.027 --> 00:05:17.769
in our regression equation.

75
00:05:17.769 --> 00:05:22.650
We can explain the resulting
2,140.54 value as the number of

76
00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:27.630
websites visits we observe without
any social media mentions at all.

77
00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:32.980
This constant term is not explained by
changes in the independent variable.

78
00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.080
How can we use what we have
calculated thus far to produce

79
00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.350
a forecast of the number of
website visits we should expect

80
00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:43.620
if we have 100 social media mentions?

81
00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.450
How about 1,500 social media mentions?

82
00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:51.720
It should be intuitive by now that
we could look up these values for

83
00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.190
social media mentions on the trendline and

84
00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:57.921
determine that corresponding
website visits' value.

85
00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:03.980
Let's do this formulaically
with Excel's forecast function.

86
00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:06.700
Forecast requires, as parameters,

87
00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:11.910
the value of the independent variable,
social media mentions in our case,

88
00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:15.640
then our datasets, starting with
the dependent variable first.

89
00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:20.100
Let's parameterize forecast and predict
how many website visits we could expect

90
00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:25.970
with 100, and then 1,500 social
media mentions, respectively.

91
00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:31.158
We see from our regression model
that we could expect approximately

92
00:06:31.158 --> 00:06:36.254
4,500 website visits for
100 social media mentions, and

93
00:06:36.254 --> 00:06:42.301
approximately 37,500 visits from
1,500 social media mentions.

94
00:06:42.301 --> 00:06:46.990
Congratulations, you now understand
how to use simple linear regression

95
00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:49.710
to develop a statistical
forecasting model.

96
00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:51.920
A few notes before we
close out this module.

97
00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:58.660
It's important to understand that our
regression model suggests that increases

98
00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:03.460
in website visits tend to happen with
increases in social media mentions,

99
00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:08.880
not that they happen because of
increases in social media mentions.

100
00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:13.450
We could also, with care, use this
model to forecast website visits for

101
00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:17.795
levels of social media mentions not
previously observed in our dataset.

102
00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:23.140
Now it's your turn to demonstrate
your understanding of these concepts

103
00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:27.358
in problem number 2B, and
the culminating exercise for the week.

104
00:07:27.358 --> 00:07:30.433
Enjoy.

105
