2
00:00:06.447 --> 00:00:09.833
The second two formulas we will
look at focus on loans and

3
00:00:09.833 --> 00:00:13.180
analyzing different components of loans.

4
00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.590
Loans have four core components.

5
00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:20.720
Rate, number of payments, present value
of the loan, and the payment amount.

6
00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.120
We can use different formulas to
calculate the missing component,

7
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.060
assuming we have three
of the four components.

8
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.120
Today we will review two of them.

9
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.800
The first problem states,

10
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.490
calculate the monthly payment required to
pay down student loan within five years.

11
00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:41.030
I frequently see people using this
formula in both a business context and

12
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.450
a personal context to quickly
calculate payment of loan, and

13
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.090
get an understanding of
the affordability of that loan.

14
00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:54.194
First, we have a yearly rate of 3.52% and
the loan is paid monthly.

15
00:00:54.194 --> 00:00:58.006
Therefore to get
the monthly interest rate,

16
00:00:58.006 --> 00:01:04.137
we are going to divide C31 by
C34 the frequency, to get 0.29%.

17
00:01:04.137 --> 00:01:08.187
The interest rate required for
the formula needs to be the interest

18
00:01:08.187 --> 00:01:12.250
rate affecting each period,
and that's why we divided.

19
00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.120
Second, we will calculate
the number of payments.

20
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.610
It's a five year loan,
paid monthly or 12 times per year.

21
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:26.050
I will multiply C33 by C34 to get 60.

22
00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:32.630
Notice, I've used a formula here instead
of hard coding to increase flexibility.

23
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.310
Now, we have all the required information,

24
00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.670
so we can begin to use a payment
function to calculate monthly payments.

25
00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.730
I will type =PMT to bring up the formula.

26
00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.790
The first input is the rate,
so I will select C32.

27
00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.990
The second is the number of payments,
so I will select C35.

28
00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.530
And finally I'm going to select
the present value of my loan or

29
00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.840
the total loan amount, C36.

30
00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.850
When I hit Enter, I will have a total
monthly loan payment of 1820.

31
00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.290
Now please try question 2B

32
00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.280
to calculate the semiannual payment for
a business loan.

33
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.895
Notice the last box to
populate total interest paid.

34
00:02:13.895 --> 00:02:17.710
Think about the difference of our loan
payments versus the total value of

35
00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:18.279
the loan.

36
00:02:18.279 --> 00:02:20.237
Give it a shot, and good luck.

37
00:02:20.237 --> 00:02:27.321
