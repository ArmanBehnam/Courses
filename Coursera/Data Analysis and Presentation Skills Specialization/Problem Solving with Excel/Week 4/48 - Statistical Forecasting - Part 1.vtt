00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.695
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:06.695 --> 00:00:12.203
Our dataset is located
conveniently on the Dataset tab.

3
00:00:12.203 --> 00:00:17.034
You'll notice here that the dataset
is comprised of two columns:

4
00:00:17.034 --> 00:00:20.420
SocialMedia_Mentions and WebsiteVisits.

5
00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.990
Each row of data reflects counts

6
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.610
of the number of mentions of our
website on social media each day,

7
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.406
and the number of visitors to
our website on that same day.

8
00:00:34.406 --> 00:00:39.300
We have 100 observations,
or rows, in our dataset.

9
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.295
For convenience of reference we have
named each of these two columns of data

10
00:00:43.295 --> 00:00:48.870
SocialMedia_Mentions and
WebsiteVisits respectively.

11
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.549
These named ranges will save us
the hassle of having to click back and

12
00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:56.830
forth between the sheets when
building our forecasting model.

13
00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:03.649
Let's get started on Problem 1A.

14
00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:07.892
You see that we are asked to
calculate the standard deviation of

15
00:01:07.892 --> 00:01:10.970
the SocialMedia_Mentions in our data set.

16
00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.325
This is a common first step when
exploring an unfamiliar dataset.

17
00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.879
To do this, we'll use Excel's
standard deviation function, STDEV.

18
00:01:22.288 --> 00:01:27.580
As we are working with a sample set
of data for our fictitious website,

19
00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.992
we'll use the sample variant
of this function STDEV.S.

20
00:01:31.992 --> 00:01:35.440
The STDEV.S formula requires,
as parameters,

21
00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.750
only the data you wish to calculate
the standard deviation of.

22
00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:41.860
In this case,

23
00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.010
we wish to compute the standard
deviation of SocialMedia_Mentions.

24
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:52.054
We will parametrize STDEV.S with
the named range SocialMedia_Mentions.

25
00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.710
We see now the standard deviation
of SocialMedia_Mentions.

26
00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.854
I've calculated the average,

27
00:02:00.854 --> 00:02:05.402
or mean value of the dataset as 753.46.

28
00:02:05.402 --> 00:02:09.248
With a standard deviation of 269.63,

29
00:02:09.248 --> 00:02:14.570
how spread out are our data
around their mean value?

30
00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.873
If we were to quickly calculate
the ratio of these two values,

31
00:02:18.873 --> 00:02:23.114
standard deviation to mean,
we'd get a value of about 36%.

32
00:02:23.114 --> 00:02:29.483
This suggests that our standard deviation
is approximately 36% of our mean.

33
00:02:29.483 --> 00:02:33.810
Or that our data are somewhat dispersed,
or spread out around the mean value.

34
00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.140
If this ratio was higher, it would
suggest even more dispersion in our data.

35
00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.897
The higher this ratio is,
the lower our confidence should be in

36
00:02:44.897 --> 00:02:49.941
the conclusions drawn from
the dataset using linear regression.

37
00:02:49.941 --> 00:02:53.570
We'd like to better understand
our dataset, though,

38
00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.210
in particular, its shape and distribution.

39
00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.518
To better understand our data,

40
00:02:59.518 --> 00:03:03.189
we will also calculate other's
descriptive statistics.

41
00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:08.116
Let's calculate the minimum and
maximum values in our SocialMedia_Mentions

42
00:03:08.116 --> 00:03:12.540
data in order to get a sense of the range
of the values these data take on.

43
00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.830
To calculate the minimum value,
we'll use Excel's MIN function.

44
00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:20.500
The MIN function requires,

45
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.240
as parameters, the values of which
you'd like to find the minimum.

46
00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:31.497
In this case, we'll parametrize MIN with
the SocialMedia_Mentions named range,

47
00:03:31.497 --> 00:03:32.820
and set it to work.

48
00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.160
We can find the maximum value in a similar
manner using Excel's MAX function.

49
00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.540
Similar to MIN, MAX requires,

50
00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.920
as parameters, the values of which
you'd like the find the maximum.

51
00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.970
Let's parametrize MAX with our
SocialMedia_Mentions named range, and

52
00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.460
set it to work.

53
00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:56.850
For further convenience of reference,
we have created named ranges for

54
00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.760
each of the values and ranges we
calculate as part of this problem.

55
00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:07.061
We have named the cells in which
we've just calculated the minimum and

56
00:04:07.061 --> 00:04:10.554
maximum values,
Min_SocialMedia_Mentions and

57
00:04:10.554 --> 00:04:13.901
Max_SocialMedia_Mentions, respectively.

58
00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.330
We will follow a similar
intuitive process for

59
00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:19.661
creating named ranges
throughout these exercises.

60
00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:25.050
When you see us type formula going
forward, please note that the named

61
00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.490
ranges referenced have been
created to assist our exercise.

62
00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.290
We suggest you use named ranges also when
completing the exercises in this module

63
00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.510
and when conducting spreadsheet
analysis of your own.

64
00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.570
It would be ideal to visualize
the shape of the data

65
00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.620
to get a sense of how they are dispersed.

66
00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:48.070
One way to do this is to plot a histogram.

67
00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:53.940
Histograms show counts of data values
which fall within equally-sized

68
00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.110
buckets across the range
of values our data take on.

69
00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.460
This maybe a bit hard to follow just now,
but as we work through this exercise,

70
00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.410
you'll develop a better
understanding of histograms.

71
00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:08.720
We've also provided references to
additional material on histograms,

72
00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.050
which we advise you to explore.

73
00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.574
In the meanwhile though, let's prepare
to plot a histogram of our data.

74
00:05:16.647 --> 00:05:22.917
Our first step is to determine the number
of buckets, or more formally bins,

75
00:05:22.917 --> 00:05:28.040
which we will use to collect or
bucket values from our dataset.

76
00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.224
As we have only 100
observations in our dataset,

77
00:05:32.224 --> 00:05:37.300
a nice number of bins would be
something between 10 and 15.

78
00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:42.550
Let's choose 12 as our number of bins, and
enter this value into the spreadsheet.

79
00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:46.860
Next, we need to determine the size,
or width of our bins.

80
00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.490
Again, think of these as buckets.

81
00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:54.420
Let's take our maximum value observed in
the dataset and divide that by our desired

82
00:05:54.420 --> 00:06:00.580
number of bins to ensure we get
a reasonable fit to our dataset.

83
00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:04.893
Let's use the INT function to round our
result down to the nearest integer.

84
00:06:08.358 --> 00:06:13.429
You'll notice that our next highlighted
range has automatically populated.

85
00:06:13.429 --> 00:06:17.259
These are the values which
demarcate each of our 12 bins.

86
00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:23.250
Let's explore the calculations necessary
to produce the values for each bin.

87
00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:27.941
You'll notice that the value
of our first bin is 114.

88
00:06:27.941 --> 00:06:29.960
When we build our histogram,

89
00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:34.807
the number of observations in our
dataset of SocialMedia_Mentions,

90
00:06:34.807 --> 00:06:39.670
which are less than or equal to 114,
will be countered for this bin.

91
00:06:41.478 --> 00:06:45.120
We will effectively count
the number of observations in

92
00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:50.780
the 0 to 114 inclusive
bucket of our chart.

93
00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:56.540
It follows, then, that we want to
increment the next bucket or bin boundary

94
00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:01.090
by our bin size of 114.

95
00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:05.793
This is exactly what we do to
calculate the next bin value.

96
00:07:05.793 --> 00:07:12.888
You'll see here, that we take our previous
bin value and add our bin size to it.

97
00:07:12.888 --> 00:07:16.278
Please note that this logic pervades
throughout the balance of our bin

98
00:07:16.278 --> 00:07:17.086
calculations.

99
00:07:22.241 --> 00:07:27.086
You may wonder why, if we're bucketing
our data, we don't calculate our last

100
00:07:27.086 --> 00:07:31.010
bucket as a value greater than
the maximum value of our data set.

101
00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:35.940
We'll address this shortly when we
calculate the values for our histogram.

102
00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:43.220
Now, let's use the histogram feature
of the Analysis ToolPak to bin or

103
00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:49.410
bucket our SocialMedia_Mentions dataset,
using the bins we've just calculated.

104
00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:55.040
To access the Histogram tool,
click on the Data tab of the ribbon,

105
00:07:55.040 --> 00:08:00.420
and select the Data Analysis
button in the Analysis grouping.

106
00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:04.300
Next, select the Histogram
tool from the list box.

107
00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:09.100
This tool will guide us through
the process of creating the data for

108
00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:10.600
our histogram.

109
00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:13.870
The first input to
the tool is Input Range.

110
00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:19.150
This is the data in our
SocialMedia_Mentions named range.

111
00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:23.500
You can either type the name of our
named range into this field, or

112
00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:26.640
select the range from the Dataset tab.

113
00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:29.370
The next input to the Histogram tool

114
00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:31.820
is the range containing
the values of our bins.

115
00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:38.047
Let's point the tool to
the bin's SocialMedia_Mentions

116
00:08:38.047 --> 00:08:41.710
range either by typing the name
of the named range, or

117
00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:46.090
by selecting the range using
the range selection button.

118
00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:50.590
We've created a placeholder,
which is also linked to a lovely chart,

119
00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:53.170
in the spreadsheet for Problem Number 1A.

120
00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:57.660
Lastly, let's tell the Histogram
tool where to output the data for

121
00:08:57.660 --> 00:08:59.280
our histogram too.

122
00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:03.658
Let's tell the Histogram tool to output
its calculations starting in the cell

123
00:09:03.658 --> 00:09:06.910
immediately below the row
containing the bolded header,

124
00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:08.721
Data Analysis ToolPak Output.

125
00:09:11.313 --> 00:09:15.288
We encourage you to examine how this
simple Excel column chart was created

126
00:09:15.288 --> 00:09:17.580
though, independently.

127
00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:20.220
We can determine by
examining the histogram,

128
00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:25.210
that our data tend to be disbursed
around the center-most value bin.

129
00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:27.580
It seems that there are fewer and

130
00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:31.530
fewer observations of data with
values significantly different than

131
00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:35.640
the center-most value bin as we
go to the left or right of it.

132
00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:39.830
In fact, this histogram rather
resembles the famous bell curve

133
00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:42.100
with which you may be acquainted.

134
00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:45.470
The histogram is a very useful tool in
developing a sense of the shape and

135
00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:48.330
distribution of a series of data.

136
00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:52.465
We can also see that
values between 685 and

137
00:09:52.465 --> 00:09:57.890
798 occur most frequently
within this dataset.

138
00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:04.214
As the 798 bin is the tallest column
when plotted in our histogram.

139
00:10:04.214 --> 00:10:08.346
You will recall our standard
deviation of about 270.

140
00:10:08.346 --> 00:10:13.283
With a bin size of 114,
we can see visually that one standard

141
00:10:13.283 --> 00:10:18.890
deviation is about two and a half bins
to either side of the central bin.

142
00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:23.690
A histogram is a useful tool to
allow us to quickly determine

143
00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:24.890
the shape of our data.

144
00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:29.401
Let's continue calculating
descriptive statistics of

145
00:10:29.401 --> 00:10:31.380
our SocialMedia_Mentions dataset.

146
00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:36.399
You'll recall from our introduction
to this module, that the variance is

147
00:10:36.399 --> 00:10:40.620
another measure of how spread out values
are in a dataset from their mean value.

148
00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:45.970
Let's calculate the variance of
the SocialMedia_Mentions series.

149
00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:51.220
Excel's built-in VAR function
will calculate variance for us.

150
00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:54.168
Again, as we're working
with a sample set of data,

151
00:10:54.168 --> 00:10:58.001
we'll use the VAR.S() function
to calculate sample variance.

152
00:10:58.001 --> 00:11:00.913
VAR.S() requires, as parameters,

153
00:11:00.913 --> 00:11:04.857
the values you wish to
calculate sample variance for.

154
00:11:04.857 --> 00:11:09.645
Let's parametrize VAR.S() with our
SocialMedia_Mentions named range and

155
00:11:09.645 --> 00:11:10.567
set it to work.

156
00:11:10.567 --> 00:11:14.756
Notice that the value of the variance is
quite large relative to the values in

157
00:11:14.756 --> 00:11:16.928
the SocialMedia_Mentions dataset.

158
00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:22.690
It is difficult to relate this value
intuitively to the values in the dataset.

159
00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:27.240
For this reason, standard deviation,
which is the square root of variance,

160
00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:30.860
is used more frequently as a measure
of the dispersion of the dataset.

161
00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:34.646
Let's now examine how the two
series in our dataset,

162
00:11:34.646 --> 00:11:39.799
SocialMedia_Mentions and WebsiteVisits,
change or vary together.

163
00:11:39.799 --> 00:11:41.920
One measure of this is covariance.

164
00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:47.060
Similar to variance, covariance is
a bit difficult to interpret, and so

165
00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:51.890
we will subsequently calculate
the correlation of these two datasets.

166
00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:56.754
As we are working with sample data,
we will calculate sample covariance.

167
00:11:56.754 --> 00:12:01.691
Excel's COVARIANCE.S function will
calculate the sample covariance of

168
00:12:01.691 --> 00:12:03.380
two arrays.

169
00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:08.368
We will parameterize COVARIANCE.S with the
named ranges of our two series of data,

170
00:12:08.368 --> 00:12:12.220
SocialMedia_Mentions and WebsiteVisits.

171
00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:15.570
Let's do so and set COVARIANCE.S to work.

172
00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:17.900
As we are working with sample data,

173
00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:21.680
we will calculate sample
covariance of two arrays.

174
00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:26.698
We will parametrize COVARIANCE.S with the
named ranges of our two series of data,

175
00:12:26.698 --> 00:12:30.910
SocialMedia_Mentions, and Website_Visits.

176
00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:35.149
Let's do so, and set COVARIANCE.S to work.

177
00:12:35.149 --> 00:12:40.020
Notice here, similar to our variance
calculation, that the covariance

178
00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:44.350
number is quite large and difficult to
intuitively relate to values in the data.

179
00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:49.367
It would be ideal to have a normalized
expression of how these two variables,

180
00:12:49.367 --> 00:12:52.610
SocialMedia_Mentions and
WebsiteVisits, change together.

181
00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:55.935
Fortunately, we have
just that in correlation.

182
00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:05.070
You'll recall that correlation is
a normalized measure between -1 and 1,

183
00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:08.990
which indicates the direction of
the relationship between two variables

184
00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:11.220
as their values change.

185
00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:15.635
A correlation of 1 would imply that for
every one unit of increase in

186
00:13:15.635 --> 00:13:19.960
SocialMedia_Mentions, we get one
unit of increase in WebsiteVisits.

187
00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:26.470
Conversely, a correlation of -1
would imply that for every one unit

188
00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:32.325
increase in SocialMediaMentions, we get
a one unit decrease in WebsiteVisits.

189
00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:38.190
A correlation close to 0 would imply that
there is little change in WebsiteVisits,

190
00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:42.355
as SocialMedia_Mentions change,
either positively or negatively.

191
00:13:42.355 --> 00:13:48.108
Let's calculate correlation between
SocialMedia_Mentions and WebsiteVisits.

192
00:13:48.108 --> 00:13:52.640
Excel's CORREL function
will calculate this for us.

193
00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:58.089
It requires, as parameters, the two arrays
for which it will calculate correlation.

194
00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:01.190
Let's set it to work on our two variables.

195
00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:07.402
Notice that we have calculated
the value of 0.79 as the correlation

196
00:14:07.402 --> 00:14:11.025
between SocialMedia_Mentions and
WebsiteVisits.

197
00:14:13.268 --> 00:14:16.066
As this number is positive and close to 1,

198
00:14:16.066 --> 00:14:21.760
we can conclude that these two variables
are fairly strongly positively correlated.

199
00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:28.256
Let's explore one final measure of the
strength of the relationship between our

200
00:14:28.256 --> 00:14:29.278
two variables.

201
00:14:29.278 --> 00:14:32.634
R-Squared, or
the coefficient of determination,

202
00:14:32.634 --> 00:14:37.628
is a measure of the proportion of variance
in one variable which can be predicted

203
00:14:37.628 --> 00:14:39.130
by the other variable.

204
00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:43.683
It takes values between 0 and 1.

205
00:14:43.683 --> 00:14:49.243
An R-Squared of 1, for our two variables,
could be interpreted as 100% of

206
00:14:49.243 --> 00:14:55.250
variance in WebsiteVisits can be
explained by SocialMedia_Mentions.

207
00:14:55.250 --> 00:15:00.160
Conversely, an R-Squared value of
0 could be interpreted as 0% of

208
00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:05.341
variance in WebsiteVisits can be
explained by SocialMedia_Mentions.

209
00:15:08.392 --> 00:15:12.975
Let's calculate R-Squared, or
the coefficient of determination, for

210
00:15:12.975 --> 00:15:17.950
our two variables,
SocialMedia_Mentions and WebsiteVisits.

211
00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:22.564
Excel's RSQ function will
calculate R-Squared for us, and

212
00:15:22.564 --> 00:15:27.000
requires as parameters,
the array of observations of each

213
00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.653
of SocialMedia_Mentions and WebsiteVisits.

214
00:15:32.836 --> 00:15:36.950
Note that it asks for known Ys first.

215
00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:39.730
So let's be sure to
enter our WebsiteVisits,

216
00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:43.030
the dependant variable,
as the first parameter.

217
00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:44.880
Let's set it to work.

218
00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:50.414
Notice that we calculate a value
of 0.62 as our R-Squared, or

219
00:15:50.414 --> 00:15:53.600
co-efficient of determination.

220
00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:57.565
We can interpret this as 62% of changes in

221
00:15:57.565 --> 00:16:01.085
WebsiteVisits can be explained
by SocialMedia_Mentions.

222
00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:04.839
This is not a particularly
strong R-Squared,

223
00:16:04.839 --> 00:16:07.304
as we would prefer
a value much closer to 1.

224
00:16:09.341 --> 00:16:13.910
Now it's your turn to demonstrate
your understanding of

225
00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:18.955
standard deviation, variance,
histograms, covarience,

226
00:16:18.955 --> 00:16:24.108
correlation, and
R-Squared as you work through Problem 1B.

227
00:16:24.108 --> 00:16:30.229
