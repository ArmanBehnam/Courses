2
00:00:14.405 --> 00:00:18.737
This week we are going to review
a series of financial formulas built

3
00:00:18.737 --> 00:00:20.183
directly into Excel.

4
00:00:20.183 --> 00:00:24.485
Excel has become a very powerful
financial calculator that

5
00:00:24.485 --> 00:00:28.450
can function to fulfill
many people's unique needs.

6
00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:34.441
From financial modeling, stock analysis,
loan and bond calculations, to much more.

7
00:00:34.441 --> 00:00:37.875
During this section we are going
to explore a small portion of

8
00:00:37.875 --> 00:00:42.850
Excel capabilities and go over some
of the most commonly used formulas.

9
00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.690
I encourage you to review the financial
drop-down under the Formula ribbon

10
00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.050
to get a better sense of the full
range of capabilities that Excel has.

11
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.610
The first two formulas we're going
to review are common tools in

12
00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:56.780
business modeling.

13
00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.880
That could be either company valuations,
project reviews, investment supports,

14
00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.450
etc., and are cornerstones of finance.

15
00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.666
The first is net present value.

16
00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:12.170
For those needing a quick finance
refresher, net present value, or

17
00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.930
NPV, is the value of future dollars,

18
00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.400
in terms of today's dollars,
discounted based on a given discount rate.

19
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.690
I very frequently see this used to value
a series of cash flows beyond year one.

20
00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.210
The formula consists of two main parts,
the discount rate and

21
00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.520
the selection of values to discount.

22
00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.330
It's important to keep in mind that
the first value being discounted

23
00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:42.600
is assumed to be the end of the first
period, and will be discounted one time.

24
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.546
Other things to keep in mind
are values need to be equally spaced.

25
00:01:44.546 --> 00:01:49.880
Values need to be input
in the proper order.

26
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.248
The first value will be discounted one
time and the second value two times.

27
00:01:54.248 --> 00:01:59.100
You can have up to 254 values or periods.

28
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.050
Positive cash flows will
be positive numbers, and

29
00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.520
negative cash flows will be negative.

30
00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:10.080
The second function we will review is IRR,
or internal rate of return.

31
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.960
This formula works to
calculate the discount rate

32
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.370
that would return an NPV of zero.

33
00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:16.390
Or in other terms,

34
00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.430
what is the highest discount rate that
would still return a positive NPV?

35
00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.740
The formula consists of two portions.

36
00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.980
First, the series of values, and

37
00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.250
the second is a guess at what
the interest rate will be.

38
00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.239
This is used to help speed up
the calculation based on the iterative

39
00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:37.813
calculation methodology that Excel uses
to come up with the discount rate.

40
00:02:37.813 --> 00:02:43.000
I tend to guess something with
a mid discount rate of around 5%.

41
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.050
Similar to the NPV,

42
00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.050
we have a few things that we need to
keep in mind when using this formula.

43
00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.044
Values must contain at least
one positive value and

44
00:02:52.044 --> 00:02:55.676
one negative value to calculate
the internal rate of return.

45
00:02:55.676 --> 00:03:01.682
IRR can't be calculated when values
become positive and then return negative.

46
00:03:01.682 --> 00:03:06.070
We will get a better feel when we
use these calculations in practice.

47
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:07.700
We will introduce the third and

48
00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.680
fourth formula when we are done
working with NPV and IRR.

49
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:20.130
For problem 1A, we're going to calculate
the IRR to FitCore's new super product.

50
00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.702
Let's look at the data given to us.

51
00:03:23.702 --> 00:03:30.970
We are given revenue and expense from 2017
to 2021 for a new product being launched.

52
00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.860
Using this information,
we can glean the overall profit.

53
00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.170
During our work, we generally work with
cash flows instead of accounting profit.

54
00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.837
But for this exercise,
we're going to assume they're the same.

55
00:03:42.837 --> 00:03:45.958
All right,
let's return to the working tab.

56
00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:50.639
First, let's open
the Formulas ribbon using our

57
00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:55.710
keyboard shortcut Alt+M for
finance formulas.

58
00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.800
I would encourage you to review
the rest of these on your own to

59
00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.270
get a sense of what formulas exist.

60
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:04.792
For now, to avoid using the Wizard,

61
00:04:04.792 --> 00:04:09.795
I'm going to hit Escape,
and then just type =NPV.

62
00:04:09.795 --> 00:04:14.853
The first value which is required
will be the discount rate,

63
00:04:14.853 --> 00:04:17.241
which we are given in E11.

64
00:04:17.241 --> 00:04:22.449
Second, we will now select the profit from

65
00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:29.280
2017 to 2021, found on the data sheet.

66
00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.200
If you notice,
the first value is at the end of year one,

67
00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.160
assuming the current year is 2016.

68
00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:41.680
If this was not the case and
we had a value for 2016, we would not

69
00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.850
want to discount that cash flow, and could
simply add it on the end of the formula.

70
00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.500
However, since this is not the case,
we can hit enter and

71
00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.127
get our answer of $46.49.

72
00:04:54.127 --> 00:04:58.420
Our first result assumes
the given discount rate.

73
00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:02.020
However, I may be curious
about other discount rates and

74
00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.040
how high my cost of capital or
discount rate could be,

75
00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:10.420
still allowing this project to
have a positive investment thesis.

76
00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.270
To do this I would use the IRR function.

77
00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:20.830
First I would type =IRR, and then select
the same values from the dataset.

78
00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.870
Please notice that the cash
flows start with a negative and

79
00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:31.090
then transition to a positive value
without returning back to the negative.

80
00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:37.880
If, in 2020, the profit, for
example was -50 instead of 50,

81
00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.250
we would not be able to use this formula.

82
00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.979
Second, I am going to guess
a discount rate of 5%.

83
00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:49.550
Our answer is 36%,
a very high discount rate.

84
00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:54.275
I frequently use these formulas
together after building out complicated

85
00:05:54.275 --> 00:05:59.087
Excel models to help value and
determine different investment thesises.

86
00:05:59.087 --> 00:06:03.804
Now why don't you give it a shot
using TaxiEat's cash flow to better

87
00:06:03.804 --> 00:06:06.550
understand their investment thesis.

88
00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:14.347
