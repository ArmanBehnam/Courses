00:00:11.591 --> 00:00:15.238
Welcome to the introduction to
statistical forecasting module.

3
00:00:15.238 --> 00:00:20.112
During this section of the course, we will
explore fundamental statistical methods

4
00:00:20.112 --> 00:00:25.230
which are useful in using data to develop
forward expectations or forecasts.

5
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.014
Course participants are assumed to have
had some previous exposure to statistics.

6
00:00:30.014 --> 00:00:34.050
Though we will provide reference materials
to concepts presented in this module.

7
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.901
We will explain the statistical concepts
employed in the following analyses,

8
00:00:37.901 --> 00:00:41.536
that encourage participants to
further their study independently.

9
00:00:41.536 --> 00:00:44.913
We will spend a bit longer introducing
concepts in this module than we have in

10
00:00:44.913 --> 00:00:45.850
the others.

11
00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.860
Given the statistical nature of these
concepts, it's important that participants

12
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.820
spend time to understand the statistical
methods employed in this module,

13
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.820
as they are powerful, but nuanced.

14
00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.530
In order to use data to
produce statistical forecasts,

15
00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.690
we need to understand regression analysis.

16
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.950
Regression analysis is one of the most
commonly used statistical methods to

17
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.800
produce data driven forecasts.

18
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.380
Simple linear regression
analysis uses one variable,

19
00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.590
the independent variable to explain
another variable, the dependent variable.

20
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.856
For example, you might use
a person's height to explain and

21
00:01:23.856 --> 00:01:25.957
predict a person's weight.

22
00:01:25.957 --> 00:01:29.272
A thorough exploration of linear
regression is beyond the scope of

23
00:01:29.272 --> 00:01:33.001
this module, but we encourage course
participants to study this powerful

24
00:01:33.001 --> 00:01:37.750
statistical method, or to take one of
the many related courses on Coursera.

25
00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.480
There are a few concepts that you should
understand, at least at a high level

26
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.440
before we proceed to their application
in our Excel problem sets.

27
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.800
We encourage you to spend time
studying these concepts independently

28
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.580
if you are unfamiliar.

29
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.494
Standard deviation is a measurement of
the average dispersion of values in

30
00:01:55.494 --> 00:01:58.068
a data set around their average value.

31
00:01:58.068 --> 00:02:02.790
That is how spread out the data
are from their average value.

32
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.474
This is related to variance but

33
00:02:04.474 --> 00:02:09.280
it is more frequently used to describe
the average dispersion of a data set.

34
00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.140
The implication follows that a variance
in the highest standard deviation should

35
00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.480
imply lower confidence in the outputs of
a statistical forecast using the data.

36
00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.100
Standard deviation is
the square root of variance and

37
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.270
as such, relates more directly
to the values in the dataset.

38
00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.370
Variance, as previously mentioned,
also measures how far

39
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:37.010
on average a set of data values are spread
out form their average or mean.

40
00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.080
Higher variance in your data should
result in you being less confident and

41
00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.580
the accuracy of your prediction
because your data is so

42
00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.840
widely spread out around
their average value.

43
00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.870
Again, variance has the same
implication as standard deviation,

44
00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.070
it is simply squared to amplify
dispersion from the main value.

45
00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.580
Covariance is a measure of how
two variables change together.

46
00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.680
Covariance is not normalized, meaning
that there's no meaningful way to compare

47
00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.490
covariances across different variables.

48
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:10.390
We need another measurement to compare
the way two variables change together

49
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.219
in order to draw meaningful conclusions.

50
00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.200
Correlation provides us this normalized
measure of covariance, that is,

51
00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.740
how two variables change together.

52
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:24.780
Normalization of covariance results in
a measure which we can use to meaningfully

53
00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.480
compare how two variables move together.

54
00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:34.469
This is a normalized measure, and so
it results in a value between -1 and

55
00:03:34.469 --> 00:03:39.780
1 and gives an objective indication of
the relationship between two variables.

56
00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.970
It also tells us the direction of that
relationship, positive or negative.

57
00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:50.709
Values close to zero indicate that
the relationship is not very strong.

58
00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:51.788
R-squared, or

59
00:03:51.788 --> 00:03:56.720
the coefficient of determination, is
a number that indicates the proportion

60
00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.741
of the variance in one variable that
is predictable from the other variable.

61
00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:06.047
A higher R squared value indicates
a better fit of our statistical

62
00:04:06.047 --> 00:04:11.650
measurement of the relationship between
the variables to the data itself.

63
00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.690
The definition above is important to note,

64
00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.980
it has a similar
interpretation as correlation

65
00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:22.220
though since it is squared the direction
of the relationship cannot be determined.

66
00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.240
Let's have a high level overview
now of linear regression.

67
00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.600
Using linear regression we
can quantify the relationship

68
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.490
between changes in the independent,
or input, variable, and

69
00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.270
changes in the dependent,
or outcome variable.

70
00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.750
For example, let's look at
the relationship in the variables Y,

71
00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.850
X, m and B as shown on the slide below.

72
00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:55.430
We see here Y=mX+B this
relationship could be read as,

73
00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:00.130
Y is equal to m multiplied by X and
added to B.

74
00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:04.940
You may recognize this as the classic
slope intercept form of an equation for

75
00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.700
a straight line,
as we are all taught in algebra.

76
00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.390
Simple linear regression
analysis of a dataset

77
00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:15.540
may result in a similar quantified
relationship for a dataset.

78
00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:23.324
For example, our regression analysis
may result that m=3 and B=100.

79
00:05:23.324 --> 00:05:25.749
Using this quantified relationship,

80
00:05:25.749 --> 00:05:30.899
we can input values of X to predict values
of Y, which we don't have in our dataset.

81
00:05:30.899 --> 00:05:35.713
For example,
if we input a value of 100 for X,

82
00:05:35.713 --> 00:05:43.122
we can use this quantified relationship
to produce a value of 400 for Y.

83
00:05:43.122 --> 00:05:47.190
We will explore regression
analysis in a simplified example.

84
00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:51.588
First though, we must develop a thesis,
or hypothesis, for

85
00:05:51.588 --> 00:05:53.965
our forecasting relationship.

86
00:05:53.965 --> 00:05:58.434
A few additional statistical forecasting
concepts that are important to

87
00:05:58.434 --> 00:06:00.894
understand include the Y-intercept,

88
00:06:00.894 --> 00:06:05.483
which is the point where the graph
of a function, or in this case,

89
00:06:05.483 --> 00:06:11.430
the graph of our relationship between our
two variables, intersects the Y-axis.

90
00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:15.800
This is the value which cannot be
explained by our regression analysis and

91
00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:20.130
is constant despite our measured
relationship between two variables.

92
00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:24.140
This also represents the value
of our dependent variable

93
00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:26.450
when your independent
variable is equal to zero.

94
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.100
The slope of a function is a number
that describes both the direction and

95
00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:35.400
the steepness of the line
graph of that function.

96
00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:41.120
This tells us how much we expect
our dependent variable to change

97
00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.110
with every one unit change
in our independent variable.

98
00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:50.411
We show two examples of two data
sets with different standard

99
00:06:50.411 --> 00:06:55.427
deviation variants, correlation,
and R squared values.

100
00:06:55.427 --> 00:07:00.002
Notice that higher standard deviation and
variance results in

101
00:07:00.002 --> 00:07:04.843
a much more dispersed or
spread out data set around the mean value.

102
00:07:04.843 --> 00:07:07.423
While lower standard deviation and

103
00:07:07.423 --> 00:07:12.504
variance result in a more tightly
dispersed data set around the mean.

104
00:07:12.504 --> 00:07:14.976
Let's discuss our specific example.

105
00:07:14.976 --> 00:07:19.786
It will be simple and explore the use
of regression analysis to predict

106
00:07:19.786 --> 00:07:25.019
visits to a website based on the number
of social media mentions of the site.

107
00:07:25.019 --> 00:07:29.115
Our thesis here is that it's
reasonable to think that as mentions

108
00:07:29.115 --> 00:07:31.578
of a website on social media increase, 

109
00:07:31.578 --> 00:07:35.409
the number of people who visit
the site will also increase, and

110
00:07:35.409 --> 00:07:39.870
result in increased web traffic or
page hits to the site.

111
00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:43.970
Starting with a thesis like this is
fundamental to regression analysis.

112
00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:48.040
This statistical method can
be used to determine if

113
00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:51.430
there is a correlative relationship
between two variables.

114
00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:56.140
In our case, the relationship between
the number of social media mentions,

115
00:07:56.140 --> 00:08:00.000
the independent variable, and
visits to our website,

116
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.650
the dependent variable.

117
00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:06.310
We have measures of the strength of this
relationship which we will discuss later.

118
00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:10.320
If these measures indicate a strong
relationship we can conclude

119
00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:15.320
that social media mentions and
visits to our website are related.

120
00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:19.630
A strong relationship determined via
linear regression analysis does not,

121
00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:25.220
however imply a causal relationship
between the two variables.

122
00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:28.790
Said differently,
it does not imply that traffic

123
00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:33.510
increased to our website because
of social media mentions,

124
00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:38.070
but, rather,
that increased web traffic to our website

125
00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:42.380
tends to increase with increases
in social media mentions.

126
00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:44.400
This is an important distinction,

127
00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:48.260
though causal analysis is beyond
the scope of this module.

128
00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:52.160
In order to complete the exercises
in this week's problem set

129
00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:56.050
you'll need to enable
the Analysis ToolPak in Excel.

130
00:08:56.050 --> 00:09:00.230
We've included a link to instructions on
how to do this in the reference materials.

131
00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:03.300
Please take a moment to ensure
that you have the ToolPak enabled

132
00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:04.770
before continuing.

133
00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:09.643
You'll know that you've successfully
enabled the ToolPak if you see it on

134
00:09:09.643 --> 00:09:12.903
the Data tab of the ribbon,
as in our image below.
