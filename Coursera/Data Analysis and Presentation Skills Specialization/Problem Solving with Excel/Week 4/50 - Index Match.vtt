2
00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:13.963
The syntax for index match can
appear complicated at first.

3
00:00:13.963 --> 00:00:18.197
However, we are going to break
it into its subcomponents.

4
00:00:18.197 --> 00:00:20.410
Index and then match.

5
00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.340
We will work with each
formula independently, and

6
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.720
then bring them together
further into the exercise.

7
00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.930
Lets start with the INDEX function.

8
00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.660
The INDEX function
starts off by asking for

9
00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.170
the array containing the value
you are looking for,

10
00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.410
then the position of
the value within the array,

11
00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.307
and then finally what column or
row to start with.

12
00:00:43.458 --> 00:00:46.960
Let's give question 1A a try
to get a better understanding.

13
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.920
The first question asks, what country is
in the third row, inclusive of the header?

14
00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.700
Let's flip over and
take a look at our data set.

15
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.820
Here is the country column.

16
00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:12.890
The country in the third row counting
the header is one, two, three, Tanzania.

17
00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.650
However, we can use
a formula to tell us this.

18
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.753
For our own reference,
if we highlight this column We'll

19
00:01:21.753 --> 00:01:27.560
see here that this column is named
range labeled as country.

20
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.280
We will utilize name ranges going
forward throughout this exercise.

21
00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.160
Let's try this using the INDEX formula.

22
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:43.040
We're going to type =INDEX.

23
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.420
The first field asks which
array we're looking for, and

24
00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.000
we want the country which we
remember is a name range.

25
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.610
As we start to type country,
you can see it labeled down here.

26
00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.100
Lets hit tab to accept it.

27
00:01:58.158 --> 00:02:01.720
And then it's going to ask us what
row number we are looking for.

28
00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.040
The exercise is asking what
country is in the third row.

29
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.260
So we are going to say three,

30
00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:14.748
and since we selected a column, there is
no need to provide the column position.

31
00:02:14.748 --> 00:02:18.150
We will come back and
experiment with the column position later.

32
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.120
If we hit Enter we come up with Tanzania,
just as we expected.

33
00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.070
Now, why don't you give
it a shot in problem 1B?

34
00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:34.120
By looking at what is
the revenue in the fifth row.

35
00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:41.753
So the revenue associated with one,
two, three, four, five, Gabon.

36
00:02:41.753 --> 00:02:43.943
Give it a shot!

37
00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:52.273
