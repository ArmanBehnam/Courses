2
00:00:06.171 --> 00:00:09.650
Now, we are going to learn
about the match formula.

3
00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.630
To start, lets review the syntax quickly.

4
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.810
The syntax of the match formula
starts with the reference text.

5
00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:18.670
What are we looking for?

6
00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.190
Followed by the array that you
want to locate the text in,

7
00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.570
and then very similar to the view
lookup syntax the match type.

8
00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.930
Notice that there is this slight
difference here when negative one being

9
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:36.250
greater than the closest matching value,
zero, being the exact match, which is

10
00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.650
what we most frequently use, and positive
one being less than the closest value.

11
00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.090
Note that if this input is
omitted it defaults to zero.

12
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.450
Let's try to use match in
a real-world scenario.

13
00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:54.000
The question we are trying to
answer is what row is Macedonia on?

14
00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.220
Returning to the data set, we
are interested in the country column and

15
00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.800
we want to know what row
reference Macedonia is in.

16
00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.430
So let's give it a shot
using the MATCH formula.

17
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.490
We'll start by typing equals MATCH.

18
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.130
The value we are looking up is Macedonia.

19
00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:22.199
The array we are looking for
is called country.

20
00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:29.510
Here the match type is going to be
zero since we want an exact match.

21
00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.110
Let's close the formula and hit enter.

22
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.780
The formula returns that Macedonia
can be found in row eight.

23
00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.330
Now give it a shot.

24
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.880
Looking for what country EBITDA is in.

25
00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.140
Please remember that the math
formula works on vertical and

26
00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.373
horizontal sets in the exact same manner.

27
00:01:55.373 --> 00:02:01.853
