00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.560
Congratulations, you've done it.

2
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.500
You've now completed
problem solving with Excel,

3
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.730
the second course in

4
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.310
a data analysis and
presentation skills,

5
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.115
the PwC Approach Specialization.

6
00:00:23.115 --> 00:00:25.230
In this course, you
explored Excel as

7
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.255
a tool for solving
business problems.

8
00:00:27.255 --> 00:00:30.420
You began by becoming familiar
with basic functions in

9
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.890
Excel then built on

10
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.035
that knowledge to
advance your skills.

11
00:00:34.035 --> 00:00:35.790
Along the way you had a chance to

12
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.440
practice using those functions

13
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.730
and then demonstrate what you've

14
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.935
learned through
practical exercises.

15
00:00:40.935 --> 00:00:42.500
In the beginning of this course,

16
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.855
I spoke to you about
using Excel as a tool

17
00:00:44.855 --> 00:00:47.900
to think about analysis
and to solve problems.

18
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.520
I also talked about how there are

19
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.930
many different tools that we

20
00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.970
use with our clients every day.

21
00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:54.890
For example, you may use R,

22
00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.130
SAS for advanced statistical
or time series analysis.

23
00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:02.045
These various tools serve
a wide variety of functions.

24
00:01:02.045 --> 00:01:03.590
As your career progresses,

25
00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.660
you'll find that Excel
skills you have learned

26
00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.805
here and the skills
that you develop

27
00:01:07.805 --> 00:01:09.710
on your own will be valuable in

28
00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.725
learning other tools
and technologies.

29
00:01:12.725 --> 00:01:14.420
You started every week with

30
00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.580
an overview from James Hummer
talking to you about

31
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.380
the topics for that
week and giving you

32
00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.645
some business context
to consider.

33
00:01:20.645 --> 00:01:22.130
Then, in week one,

34
00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.560
we covered basic navigation
and functions.

35
00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.900
Getting this right
serves as a foundation

36
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.660
for everything else that
you will build in Excel.

37
00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.000
In week two, we
focused on formulas

38
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.490
and the important task
of data cleansing.

39
00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.700
Week three, we built on
previous weeks by exploring

40
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.560
logic statements and learning how

41
00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.020
to build and use pivot tables.

42
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.550
Finally, in Week four,

43
00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.080
you took a more advanced look at

44
00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.730
some formulas and then pulled

45
00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.510
it all together in
your final project, well done.

46
00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.490
We hope you found this course

47
00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.745
an insightful introduction to
problem solving with Excel

48
00:01:55.745 --> 00:01:58.310
and we hope it will
encourage you to continue

49
00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.550
on in the data analysis
and presentation skills,

50
00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.605
the PwC Approach Specialization.

51
00:02:04.605 --> 00:02:07.520
In the next course, you'll
have an opportunity to bring

52
00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.120
your results to life by
exploring data visualization.

53
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.310
Thanks for joining us.
