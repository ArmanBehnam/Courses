00:00:11.276 --> 00:00:12.586
Welcome to week four.

3
00:00:12.586 --> 00:00:16.003
What did you think of
Excel's pivot tables?

4
00:00:16.003 --> 00:00:21.107
Don't you think it's incredible how easily
they allow you to manipulate the data?

5
00:00:21.107 --> 00:00:25.484
If you properly construct your pivot
table, you'll be able to easily identify

6
00:00:25.484 --> 00:00:30.840
and analyze the data you'll need to answer
questions that your project requires.

7
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.800
For me, pivot tables help me get oriented
on what the data's telling me, and

8
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.089
allows me to then layer in
more advanced analysis.

9
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.670
Since this week is going to be
our final week, we're going to

10
00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.880
have a little less instruction so
you devote time to your final project.

11
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.190
We'll start the week by taking your
knowledge of formulas and moving it to

12
00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.140
a more advanced level by introducing you
to statistical and financial formulas.

13
00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.160
Having a solid foundation
on how you approach Excel,

14
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.980
remember our core principles, and
understanding the handful of critical

15
00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.830
functions you're likely to use over and
over again,

16
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.940
that will help you add value to your team
and help them solve complex problems and

17
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.040
make better decisions.

18
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.660
After looking at advanced formulas
we'll move on to your final project.

19
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.080
In your final project,

20
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.799
you'll get the chance to put
all of your new skills to use.

21
00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.090
We'll give you a scenario and

22
00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.340
a workbook and give you a chance
to build your own analytical tool.

23
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.960
By completing that assignment I think
you'll get a small taste of how satisfying

24
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.300
it can be to work in Excel.

25
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.680
Thanks for joining us for Course Two,
Problem Solving with Excel.

26
00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.220
You know the skills you've learned and the
knowledge you've gained will not only help

27
00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.210
you to more effectively use Excel, but
will certainly apply to other tools and

28
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.600
technologies you're likely to use for
data analytics.

29
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.870
Following your final project, Alex Manella
will be back to wrap things up.

30
00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.940
For now, good luck with your last week and
we hope you come back for

31
00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.589
Course Three,
Data Visualization with Advanced Excel.

32
00:02:03.589 --> 00:02:13.589
