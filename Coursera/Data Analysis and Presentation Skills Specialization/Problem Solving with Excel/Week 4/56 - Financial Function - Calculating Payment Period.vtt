For

2
00:00:07.334 --> 00:00:10.560
problem 3A,
we're going to change the variable.

3
00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.175
Instead of not knowing the payment,
we have worked with our financial

4
00:00:16.175 --> 00:00:20.660
adviser to come up with what we
can afford for a monthly payment.

5
00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.160
We now want to calculate how long it
will take us to pay down the loan and

6
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.130
what our total savings from
the accelerated payment will be.

7
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.790
Our rate, the frequency, and
the loan value all remain the same.

8
00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.730
However, let's enter negative 3,000 for
our monthly payment this time.

9
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.360
Remember the loan payment value
will be saved as a negative

10
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.590
exactly like the output from question 2A.

11
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.810
In C63, number of payment,

12
00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:53.950
we will use the NPER() function to
calculate the total number of payments.

13
00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:00.570
Let's start off by typing =nper and
looking at the syntax.

14
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.650
You will notice we need the other
three variables rate, payment, and

15
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.300
present value.

16
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.423
Let me quickly select those,

17
00:01:12.416 --> 00:01:13.700
which generates 35 payments.

18
00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.250
From here we can divide the number
of payments by the frequency

19
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.820
to calculate the amount of 2.9 years.

20
00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.527
We can see in cell C66,
this results in savings of $3,817

21
00:01:28.527 --> 00:01:35.502
when compared to the minimum interest
payments we calculated in question 2A.

22
00:01:35.502 --> 00:01:38.960
Now please try it on
your own in question 3B,

23
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.060
which revisits the same
business from question 2B.
