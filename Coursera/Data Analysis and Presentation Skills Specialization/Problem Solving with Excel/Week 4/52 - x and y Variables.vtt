00:00:03.635 --> 00:00:08.400
As we discussed earlier,
the real world applications for

3
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.540
index or match, by themselves,
are not extremely powerful.

4
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.780
However, as discussed previously,

5
00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.210
when they are used in conjunction
we can do many different things.

6
00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.070
Let's build to this slowly,
first with Index, and then Match,

7
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.960
and then bring them together.

8
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.778
First, we use the Match formula to
look up which row Tuvalu is on.

9
00:00:28.778 --> 00:00:32.850
We type =match

10
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.440
to look up the value Tuvalu,
located in cell B100.

11
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.830
The lookup array is country,
and our match type is exact.

12
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.280
This function returns the answer 14.

13
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.930
Now that we know which
row Tuvalu is located,

14
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.208
we can use the Index formula to
look up the associated revenue.

15
00:00:56.208 --> 00:00:59.429
Let's type, =index,

16
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.010
followed by the revenue array.

17
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.550
Since we just looked up that Tuvalu, is
in row 14, we can use 14 from the match.

18
00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.710
And now we can hit Enter.

19
00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.600
Now we've got the Revenue for Tuvalu.

20
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.830
Let's check that out real quick.

21
00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.860
First, we located what row Tuvalu was on,
and

22
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.610
then found the relative match in
the revenue column was equal to 1269.

23
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.790
Also, did you notice we
just did a vertical lookup

24
00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.750
with a matching value on
the right instead of the left?

25
00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.900
That is something we could have
not done using a view lookup.

26
00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.600
However, we don't always need
to do this in two steps.

27
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.300
We can also use the INDEX and
MATCH function together.

28
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:56.040
If we look at the MATCH formula again,
we see we reference C100,

29
00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.390
which contained the row reference.

30
00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.480
If we replace the C100 in
the index formula with the MATCH

31
00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.590
formula contained in cell C100,
we can do it 1 step.

32
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.650
Let's give it a shot, =index.

33
00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.460
What do we want in the index?

34
00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:21.960
It's the same as before.

35
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.790
We're trying to look up the revenue.

36
00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.490
The row number we don't actually know.

37
00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:33.440
We're going to look that up using
the MATCH formula we learned before.

38
00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.600
So for the MATCH formula,
the lookup value is Tuvalu.

39
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.710
We are trying to find Tuvalu
within the Country array.

40
00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.140
We want an exact MATCH.

41
00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.560
Now we use both these formulas together,

42
00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.790
so we need to close both the MATCH and
the INDEX formula,

43
00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.490
two parentheses at the end,

44
00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:58.990
and now we can click enter.

45
00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.850
We just built a nested
formula using both INDEX and

46
00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.000
MATCH to look up the revenue
associated with Tuvalu.

47
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.890
Now why don't you practice
on your own using first,

48
00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.460
the MATCH formula, then the INDEX formula,
and then using them together.

49
00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:21.660
In our practice set we used
the Revenue as the lookup field.

50
00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:29.280
This time you're going to try
to look up the EBITA, good luck.
