2
00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.360
Similar to COUNTIFS, SUMIFS can be
used to evaluate multiple criteria

3
00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.350
across multiple ranges
when summing values.

4
00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:18.850
Let's explore this functionality as
we work through problem number 4A.

5
00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:23.760
Problem 4A first asks us
to sum total revenue for

6
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.700
sales of more than 100 items across
each of the three sales channels,

7
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.000
listed in column Bravo
of our exercise table.

8
00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.460
We see that this implies multiple
criteria to evaluate when summing

9
00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.620
firstly that the quantity of
items sold was greater than 100,

10
00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:47.680
and secondly, that the sales channel is
equal to the values in column Bravo.

11
00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:54.981
Let's parameterize SUMIFS to sum
revenue in our dataset by first

12
00:00:54.981 --> 00:00:57.550
pointing it to the Revenue column.

13
00:01:01.332 --> 00:01:06.685
Next, let's point it to the Quantity
column of the dataset and

14
00:01:06.685 --> 00:01:11.444
tell it to only sum for
quantities greater than 100.

15
00:01:11.444 --> 00:01:17.445
Next, we'll point SUMIFS to
the Sales Channel column of the dataset

16
00:01:17.445 --> 00:01:20.285
and finally, tell it to sum for

17
00:01:20.285 --> 00:01:24.715
only the Sales Channel listed in
the current row of our exercise table.

18
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:31.524
Setting SUMIFS to work,
we see that we produced sales of

19
00:01:31.524 --> 00:01:37.243
$27,479.01 in online sales
of more than 100 items.

20
00:01:40.961 --> 00:01:45.294
Let's now use SUMIFS to build
a table of total revenue from

21
00:01:45.294 --> 00:01:47.600
all product sales by channel.

22
00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.600
While the exercise table we've outlined
may seem a bit daunting at first, you'll

23
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.870
quickly see how easy it is to summarize
our data in this fashion using SUMIFS.

24
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.220
We are summing revenue again here.

25
00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.410
So let's start by pointing SUMIFS to
the Revenue column of the dataset.

26
00:02:09.686 --> 00:02:12.034
Next, we want the sum of revenue for

27
00:02:12.034 --> 00:02:15.650
only the Sales Channel listed
in row 22 of our table.

28
00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.827
Let's type a reference to the first cell,
Charlie 22,

29
00:02:20.827 --> 00:02:26.016
and press F4 twice to lock
the row reference as absolute,

30
00:02:26.016 --> 00:02:28.870
so we can copy our formula
throughout the exercise table.

31
00:02:30.581 --> 00:02:35.957
Next, we want only the sum of revenue for
the current column Sales Channel and

32
00:02:35.957 --> 00:02:39.610
for the Product listed in
column Bravo of our table.

33
00:02:41.168 --> 00:02:46.440
Let's point SUMIFS to the Product
column of the dataset and tell it to

34
00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.770
use as criteria the Product listed in
column Bravo of our exercise table.

35
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.000
With these parameters, we can set
SUMIFS to work for the online channel.

36
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.959
We see that the formula fills down
the column of our exercise table.

37
00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.785
Because we have used a cell
reference to the sales channel,

38
00:03:06.785 --> 00:03:11.140
we can also copy this formula to
the other columns of the table,

39
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.030
and it will automatically
update the calculations for

40
00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.440
each respective sales channel.

41
00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.700
Let's definitely pause here for
a moment to validate our answer.

42
00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.140
There are two things we'll
want to validate now.

43
00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.850
Firstly, if we have correctly
calculated total revenue for

44
00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:35.100
all of our products in each channel,
the sum of revenue in this table

45
00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.235
should be equal to the sum of
total revenue in the dataset.

46
00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:45.560
This control total will help us be sure
we are summarizing all of our data.

47
00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:53.484
Let's prove this out by selecting all of
our revenue calculations in this table and

48
00:03:53.484 --> 00:03:57.423
comparing it to the total
revenue in our dataset.

49
00:03:57.423 --> 00:04:03.420
We see $82,543 in total
revenue in our calculation.

50
00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:10.820
If we compare this against the data
in the Revenue column of our dataset,

51
00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:15.858
we note that the total
revenue is also $82,543.

52
00:04:18.832 --> 00:04:22.881
We could, then, confirm the total
revenue we've calculated for

53
00:04:22.881 --> 00:04:25.060
a given product and sales channel.

54
00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:30.080
If we did so, we'd notice that we've
calculated this table correctly.

55
00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.450
SUMIFS is another powerful tool
to help us summarize data.

56
00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.790
We hope you'll spend time to
understand this very useful function.

57
00:04:41.707 --> 00:04:46.865
Now it's your turn to
demonstrate your expanded

58
00:04:46.865 --> 00:04:52.540
understanding of SUMIFS
by completing problem 4B.

59
00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.718
