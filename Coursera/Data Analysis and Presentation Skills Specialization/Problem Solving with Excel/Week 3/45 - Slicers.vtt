2
00:00:05.545 --> 00:00:09.626
The last section we'll be learning to
gather in our pivot table lesson is

3
00:00:09.626 --> 00:00:11.678
the slicer function.

4
00:00:11.678 --> 00:00:14.720
Slicers are an easy to use
filtering component that

5
00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.460
contain a set of buttons to filter.

6
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.393
As you will see,
slicers are very beneficial to create

7
00:00:20.393 --> 00:00:24.029
an interactive dashboard for
clients, or even internal teams, so

8
00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.138
that that all individuals can manipulate
the data for their own knowledge.

9
00:00:28.138 --> 00:00:32.586
In problem 7A we are going to find out
which products were sold in France and

10
00:00:32.586 --> 00:00:33.160
Brazil.

11
00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.420
To do this we'll click anywhere
on the pivot table and

12
00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:43.110
then we'll go to the Analyze ribbon and
click Insert Slicer.

13
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.590
This menu will show us
all of the variables and

14
00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.290
we can choose which slicer we would
like to put in next to our pivot table.

15
00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.115
So for this question we want to know
which products were sold in France and

16
00:00:54.115 --> 00:00:56.382
Brazil, so we want to limit it by country.

17
00:00:56.382 --> 00:00:59.450
So I am going to click the Country box and
hit OK.

18
00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.900
Next we're going to select France and
Brazil in our slicer in order to

19
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.860
filter our table to only show
the quantity for those two countries.

20
00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.700
So first, I'll click Brazil,
since it's on top and once that's selected,

21
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.180
I'll scroll down to France and
hold control and click France,

22
00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.410
so that I know that they're both selected.

23
00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.660
And in order to double-check, I'm just
going to stretch out our slicer a little

24
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.830
bit, and
we can see that they're both pink.

25
00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.270
Also, you can easily clear the filter
by clicking the filter with the red X

26
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.570
on the top right-hand
corner of your slicer.

27
00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.700
And now all of our filters are cleared.

28
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.830
Now it's time for your last
exercise in the pivot table lesson.

29
00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:50.110
Problem 7B, provide a list of countries
by revenue of the combined online and

30
00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.158
retail sales.

31
00:01:51.158 --> 00:01:58.937
