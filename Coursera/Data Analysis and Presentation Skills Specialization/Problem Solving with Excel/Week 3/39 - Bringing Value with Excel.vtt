00:00:11.592 --> 00:00:13.799
Hi, my name is Lisa Sawicki.

3
00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.036
I'm a partner with our assurance practice.

4
00:00:16.036 --> 00:00:19.877
I lead audit engagements for some of our
largest financial institution clients,

5
00:00:19.877 --> 00:00:24.150
and I also lead our New York metro
financial services assurance practice.

6
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.920
There's no doubt that data and

7
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.970
analytics are critical to our
evolving assurance strategy.

8
00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.069
I've been performing audits for 27 years,

9
00:00:32.069 --> 00:00:34.697
and while our end goal
is essentially the same,

10
00:00:34.697 --> 00:00:39.280
the way we go about doing our work
has very much evolved over time.

11
00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.570
The ability to leverage large
volumes of data allows for

12
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.390
us to perform a higher quality audit,

13
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.920
allows us to be more efficient
in the way we perform our work,

14
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.750
and also allows us to provide better
insights back to our clients.

15
00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.480
Data in general and
the availability of large volumes of data

16
00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.660
is very much a part of most
conversations we have today.

17
00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.370
Be it with our clients, or
internally as we run our business.

18
00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.330
Everyone recognizes having
data can be powerful.

19
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.430
But being able to harness the data and
analyze it to enable companies and

20
00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:15.000
organizations to make better decisions
is where we can really see the benefits.

21
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.640
Our clients are doing this
in their own business, and

22
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.000
they expect their service
providers to be doing the same.

23
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.020
Today's professionals have so much more
data readily available than ever before.

24
00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.710
It is important for them to be curious
about the information available and

25
00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.700
apply critical thinking skills
to help digest that information.

26
00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.440
You use tools available to you to
summarize the data, then interpret it.

27
00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.570
Applying both traditional thinking and

28
00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.160
thinking outside the box
are important to any professional.

29
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.450
It's critical to have an open mind and
be agile as you work with the data.

30
00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.390
And to be thinking about how the data
you'll be working with can help

31
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.160
you achieve your desired end result.

32
00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.410
Presenting the data in
a useful way is critical.

33
00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.660
So thinking about your end user
should be uppermost in your mind.

34
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.010
Excel is a key tool that can
help you manipulate the data

35
00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.780
to give you some information on
historical results or trends.

36
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.800
You can use Excel to standardize
formulas across a large data set and

37
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.590
you can also use it to perform conditional
formatting to call out certain

38
00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.900
outcomes that might be of interest.

39
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.580
You can also start to leverage
Macros to automate certain tasks,

40
00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.800
which minimize error in the future and
also help efficiency.

41
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.920
You can use Pivot tables to help
sort through different data sets

42
00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.995
to come up with more meaningful
information that can be further analyzed.

43
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.580
No doubt that being proficient at
Excel is a minimum requirement for

44
00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.110
any professional today.

45
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.370
We use it a lot in our day to day tasks.

46
00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.060
And being able to quickly maneuver through
Excel files is critical to one's success.

47
00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.800
Let the program do the mechanical work for
you and you can focus on the output and

48
00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.810
spend your time analyzing
that information.

49
00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.860
Many of the clients I work with
operate in a global environment,

50
00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.280
so consolidating and analyzing data from
a variety of sources are things we work

51
00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.429
through on a daily basis.

52
00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.203
As a recent example, our team and
our client wanted to get

53
00:03:07.203 --> 00:03:11.899
a view of the controls that operate across
the world and among various businesses

54
00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:16.684
to try to understand whether the risks
associated with the controls are similar,

55
00:03:16.684 --> 00:03:20.184
and whether the controls are being
executed consistently across

56
00:03:20.184 --> 00:03:23.428
the organization, and so
the team used Excel to organize and

57
00:03:23.428 --> 00:03:27.002
tag different businesses and
the controls associated with them.

58
00:03:27.002 --> 00:03:31.054
And also analyze the risk associated with
those controls that are implemented at

59
00:03:31.054 --> 00:03:33.410
the various different locations.

60
00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.080
Then we analyzed the data we received.

61
00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.290
After filtering through the data in Excel,

62
00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.120
the exercise helped identify
potential duplicate controls and

63
00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.130
controls that are not being executed in a
consistent fashion, which was the intent.

64
00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.871
It also helped identify areas where
the risks attributed to the controls were

65
00:03:50.871 --> 00:03:51.619
different, so

66
00:03:51.619 --> 00:03:55.258
the rigor at which the controls should
be tested should also be different,

67
00:03:55.258 --> 00:03:57.910
commensurate with the underlying risk.

68
00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.340
We then had an opportunity to study
the differences to determine if they were

69
00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.320
warranted, or whether the clients should
push for improved alignment going forward.

70
00:04:06.392 --> 00:04:09.830
There is no way we would have been able
to get a view across the thousands of

71
00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.740
controls and related attributes
without leveraging the use of Excel.

72
00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.613
Excel served as a key enabler for
this exercise,

73
00:04:16.613 --> 00:04:21.251
just as it does for many other situations
we deal with on a day-to-day basis.

74
00:04:21.251 --> 00:04:27.163
