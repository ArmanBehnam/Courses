2
00:00:05.482 --> 00:00:10.028
The next tool in pivot tables that we
will be looking at are advanced filters.

3
00:00:10.028 --> 00:00:11.487
The first exercise,

4
00:00:11.487 --> 00:00:16.840
Problem 5a is very similar to something
we did earlier in our exercises.

5
00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.310
In the past example, we were tying to
solve the top five countries by revenue.

6
00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.878
So we use a sort function to get
the highest revenue at the top.

7
00:00:25.878 --> 00:00:27.180
Using an advanced filter,

8
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.740
we're going to display just the top
four products by quantity sold.

9
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.530
To do this, let's click
the dialogue box next to Products.

10
00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.850
And there is an option for
Value Filters, so

11
00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.070
let's scroll down there and
see what pops up.

12
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.140
In this example,

13
00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.240
we're going to use the Top 10 value
filter, so I'm going to click on that.

14
00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:55.387
And you can see right now we are showing
the top 10 items by sum of quantity.

15
00:00:55.387 --> 00:00:59.721
The question asks only for
the top four products, so

16
00:00:59.721 --> 00:01:03.180
I'm going to change this from 10 to 4.

17
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.570
And now it reads top four
items by sum of quantity.

18
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:07.832
So I'm going to hit OK.

19
00:01:07.832 --> 00:01:12.514
And now you can see we are only displaying
the top four products by quantity sold.

20
00:01:12.514 --> 00:01:16.803
Technically, we could get to the same
answer using a sort function, but

21
00:01:16.803 --> 00:01:22.029
you'll see here the advanced filters out
anything that doesn't answer our question.

22
00:01:22.029 --> 00:01:27.775
Problem 5b reads, which products contain
in their description 200 milliliters and

23
00:01:27.775 --> 00:01:29.927
what are their quantities sold?

24
00:01:29.927 --> 00:01:33.250
To answer this,
we'll use an advanced filter.

25
00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.340
So I'll click the dialogue
box next to products and

26
00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.660
in this case, we're not looking at
a value, we're looking at a label or text.

27
00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.860
So I'll scroll down to Label Filters.

28
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.520
Now, there are many options here.

29
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.540
We could say, it equals 200 milliliters.

30
00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.310
It begins with 200 milliliters, but

31
00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.870
I'm not sure where that 200 milliliters
is going to come in the title.

32
00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:59.620
So I'm going to click Contains.

33
00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.550
Because we are only
concerned with products

34
00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.070
that contain 200 milliliters
in their description.

35
00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:12.350
When I click on that, a box pops up asking
me what I would like to filter for.

36
00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.610
And I'm going to type in 200ml and
click OK.

37
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.780
This pivot table shows only products
with 200 milliliters within their title,

38
00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.780
and it also shows the quantity sold.

39
00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.040
The next function of pivot tables that
we're going to learn is the get pivot

40
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.650
data function.

41
00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.560
So this is a function just like
anything else, like a sum or

42
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.550
a vlookup, but it's actually
referencing into your pivot table.

43
00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.460
This is very beneficial because
you've already taken the time

44
00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.580
to craft your pivot table
to summarize your data.

45
00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.390
And you can use an easy formula
to reference into that.

46
00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.550
To illustrate this I'm
going to type the = sign,

47
00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:01.200
click into our pivot table and you can
see that a formula was auto populated.

48
00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.022
So it says GETPIVOTDATA, Revenue, F44,

49
00:03:05.022 --> 00:03:10.665
which is the first cell of our
pivot table, Country, and France.

50
00:03:10.665 --> 00:03:15.067
So, very easily here, we just typed
the = sign and clicked in and

51
00:03:15.067 --> 00:03:20.767
this formula will pull the revenue for the
country of France within our pivot table.

52
00:03:20.767 --> 00:03:25.341
Other ways to access this
function other than to hit = and

53
00:03:25.341 --> 00:03:27.724
click into your pivot table,

54
00:03:27.724 --> 00:03:33.551
you can also type out the function
by typing = and typing GETPIVOTDATA.

55
00:03:33.551 --> 00:03:38.096
Or if you have a function that's already
referencing your pivot table data, you can

56
00:03:38.096 --> 00:03:42.810
just copy that down and change some of
those fields to get the desired data.

57
00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.190
In 5C it's your turn to filter for

58
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.561
countries with revenue between $2000 and
$3000.

59
00:03:49.561 --> 00:03:54.900
Since we're looking at dollars,
you're going to use a value filter.

60
00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.750
Read through the options in the value
filter's menu to try to get to this answer

61
00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.970
as efficiently as possible.

62
00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.830
Problem 5D asks us to complete the
following chart based on the pivot table

63
00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:11.270
you used in Problem 5C, by editing
the pivot table reference formula.

64
00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:14.200
Let's click into the table to
see what we're starting with.

65
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.920
So, it looks like someone
typed in Canada in this cell.

66
00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:24.927
And in the next cell there is a formula,
it says GETPIVOTDATA(Revenue,

67
00:04:24.927 --> 00:04:28.664
a cell reference, Country, Canada.

68
00:04:28.664 --> 00:04:33.600
If we click into this formula up above
we'll get a little more information.

69
00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.765
Now, the formula says,
GETPIVOTDATA( and then asks for

70
00:04:37.765 --> 00:04:40.402
the data field you are trying to get.

71
00:04:40.402 --> 00:04:42.718
And we are trying to look at Revenue.

72
00:04:42.718 --> 00:04:44.898
Next, it says the pivot table, so

73
00:04:44.898 --> 00:04:48.220
we reference the cell where
the pivot table starts.

74
00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.670
Next, shows the country is
what we're looking for and

75
00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:55.110
the country's name is Canada.

76
00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:01.940
So I'm going to copy and
paste this below to utilize per problem.

77
00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:07.028
When I copy and paste this, everything
here is the same except instead of Canada,

78
00:05:07.028 --> 00:05:09.697
I'm looking for information on Finland.

79
00:05:09.697 --> 00:05:13.524
So I'm just going to replaced
Canada with Finland.

80
00:05:13.524 --> 00:05:20.567
And now we can easily see that
the revenue for Finland is $2,277.

81
00:05:20.567 --> 00:05:25.132
For Problem 5E, which is the last
problem in the advanced filter section,

82
00:05:25.132 --> 00:05:29.984
you're going to complete the following
chart based on the pivot table in Problem

83
00:05:29.984 --> 00:05:33.068
5C by editing the pivot
table reference formula.

84
00:05:33.068 --> 00:05:37.697
You can do this by copying it down and
typing in Mongolia where Canada is

85
00:05:37.697 --> 00:05:41.234
written or
you can try to write the formula yourself.

86
00:05:41.234 --> 00:05:41.776
It's up to you.

87
00:05:41.776 --> 00:05:51.776
