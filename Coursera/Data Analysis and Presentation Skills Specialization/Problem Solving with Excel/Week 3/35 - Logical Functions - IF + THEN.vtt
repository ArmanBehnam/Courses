00:00:04.684 --> 00:00:09.677
Excel provides functions to
assist in applying IF-THEN

3
00:00:09.677 --> 00:00:12.180
type logic in our analysis.

4
00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.320
The IF function is
the foundation of these.

5
00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:22.240
Let's explore the application of
IF by working through problem 5A.

6
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.372
Problem 5A asks us to determine whether
a given product sales scenario,

7
00:00:29.372 --> 00:00:33.200
meets or
exceeds our revenue target of $450.

8
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.447
The IF function takes, as parameters,
the Boolean test,

9
00:00:38.447 --> 00:00:44.310
that is true or false test,
we wish to apply to our data.

10
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:49.610
Then what to do with if the test is true
and lastly what to do if it is false.

11
00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:55.191
We want to know if revenues
are greater than or equal to $450.

12
00:00:55.191 --> 00:01:00.163
We see then that our IF formula
accurately returns an indication

13
00:01:00.163 --> 00:01:04.870
of whether each sales scenario meets or
exceeds the target.

14
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.970
Understanding this example, while simple,

15
00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:15.410
is the first step in applying more
complex IF-THEN tests to our data.

16
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.161
Now it's your turn to demonstrate your
understanding of the IF function by

17
00:01:22.161 --> 00:01:23.859
completing Problem 5B.
