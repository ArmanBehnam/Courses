00:00:06.322 --> 00:00:07.523
In this next section,

3
00:00:07.523 --> 00:00:11.890
we're going to learn how to use
a calculated field in a Pivot Table.

4
00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:16.180
Adding a calculated field to a Pivot Table
allows you to calculate an amount

5
00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.280
using the variables already
within your Pivot Table.

6
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.530
So you don't need to do it in a separate
Excel workbook or using a calculator.

7
00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:27.220
It's also easy to add in to
your already formatted table.

8
00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.625
In problem 6A, we would like to
insert a calculated field for tax,

9
00:00:30.625 --> 00:00:32.193
which is 7.5% of revenue.

10
00:00:32.193 --> 00:00:37.960
We're also going to add in
sales channel as a column.

11
00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.400
So first, I'm going to click into the
pivot table, and I'm going to move over to

12
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:48.050
our Pivot Table Field menu so we can
change the variables that we're showing.

13
00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.430
So right now, we have the sum
of quantity in our table, but

14
00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.440
it looks like we're going
to be referencing revenue.

15
00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.490
So let's change the value
from quantity to revenue.

16
00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:03.510
I'm going to click the arrow next to
Sum of Quantity and click Remove Field.

17
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.120
Next, I'm going to go up here to
our variables, click on Revenue and

18
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.370
drag it down to Values.

19
00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:14.100
The question also asks us to
include Sales Channel as a column.

20
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.890
So I'm going to go back to our Pivot Table
Field menu, click on Sales Channel and

21
00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.280
drag that down to the Columns.

22
00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.250
The next step is actually
creating our calculated field.

23
00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.960
So first I'm going to make sure that we're
clicked into our current pivot table, and

24
00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.290
then up top in our Analyze ribbon.

25
00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.210
I'm going to click on Fields, Items, and

26
00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.310
here you can see an option is calculated
fields, so I'm going to click that.

27
00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.620
Be sure to name your field because if
you're making many calculated fields,

28
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.120
you want to remember so
you can refer to them in the future.

29
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.212
So in the name section,
I'm going to type in tax.

30
00:01:54.212 --> 00:01:58.313
For the formula,
I'm going to delete out the zero, and

31
00:01:58.313 --> 00:02:02.410
we would like tax to be 7.5% of revenue.

32
00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.110
So, you can see in the menu below
are all the different options

33
00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.040
of what we can refer to, and
we are going to look at revenue.

34
00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:13.774
So, I'm going to double-click revenue
to bring it into our formula function,

35
00:02:13.774 --> 00:02:18.582
and then type multiplied by 7.5%,

36
00:02:18.582 --> 00:02:23.440
which is 0.075 and hit OK.

37
00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.840
Now, when we go into
our pivot table fields,

38
00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.750
we can see that there is a tax option.

39
00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.370
So I'm going to click that.

40
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.440
And now we can see the revenue and

41
00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.160
tax for each of our products
separated by sales channels.

42
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.780
It's important to think of
formatting at every step of

43
00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.420
the process when creating a pivot table,

44
00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.520
and since we're dealing with
all dollar values here,

45
00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.650
I'm going to highlight our pivot table.

46
00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:55.754
Go to the Home ribbon, and in this Number
Section, we can change it to Currency.

47
00:02:55.754 --> 00:02:59.880
So now we'll add dollar signs and
decimal points to our data.

48
00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.130
Now it's your turn to try to
create a calculated field.

49
00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.819
In problem 6B,
you'll be inserting a calculated field for

50
00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:14.708
cost which is 50% of revenue.

51
00:03:14.708 --> 00:03:19.137
