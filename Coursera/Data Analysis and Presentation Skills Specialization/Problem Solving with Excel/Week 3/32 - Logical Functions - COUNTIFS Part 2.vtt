2
00:00:04.822 --> 00:00:07.341
COUNTIFS() is quite powerful and 

3
00:00:07.341 --> 00:00:11.844
can evaluate multiple sets of criteria
against multiple ranges in our

4
00:00:11.844 --> 00:00:16.360
dataset in order to return
increasingly complicated calculations.

5
00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:22.900
Let's explore how to use COUNTIFS
to evaluate multiple criteria

6
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.340
when counting values in problem 2A.

7
00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:32.470
We're asked to count the number of
sales of the Super Soft Bulk two liters

8
00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.450
product across three sales channels:
online, direct, and retail.

9
00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.964
Manually filtering our dataset down
to calculate this would be cumbersome.

10
00:00:51.373 --> 00:00:57.150
The product, let's select the product
column of our dataset as the first range.

11
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:03.460
Then let's select the value we've
entered in Charley 11 and change

12
00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.550
the reference to an absolute reference on
both the column and row by hitting F4.

13
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.530
Next, we want to count
by sales channel and so

14
00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.120
we'll select the sales channel
column of our dataset.

15
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.730
Lastly, let's count for the sales
channel values in column bravo or

16
00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.430
the sales channel column
of our problem table.

17
00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.301
Let's set COUNTIFS to work on this
more complicated counting exercise.

18
00:01:39.751 --> 00:01:44.373
Let's validate sales of
the Super Soft Bulk 2 liters product by

19
00:01:44.373 --> 00:01:46.950
the online channel in the data set.

20
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.807
We'll first filter down to
the Super Soft Bulk 2 liters product in

21
00:01:52.807 --> 00:01:55.380
the product column of our dataset.

22
00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.570
Within the resulting filtered data,
let's select only values for

23
00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.990
the online sales channel in
the sales channel column.

24
00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:09.384
We see here that there were indeed four
sales of this product via the online

25
00:02:09.384 --> 00:02:09.990
channel.

26
00:02:19.552 --> 00:02:24.424
We see then, that we can use COUNTIFS
to evaluate multiple criteria

27
00:02:24.424 --> 00:02:29.560
across multiple ranges of data to
calculate summary COUNTIFS values.

28
00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:35.170
This is a useful and powerful tool when
summarizing data in spreadsheet analysis.

29
00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.229
Now, it's your turn to demonstrate your
increased understanding of COUNTIFS by

30
00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:42.664
completing problem 2B.
