1
00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:06.058
[SOUND] We can combine
multiple IF statements

2
00:00:06.058 --> 00:00:10.769
together in order to perform multiple

3
00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.199
IF- THEN analyses using our data.

4
00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:18.791
This combination called
nesting is powerful and

5
00:00:18.791 --> 00:00:22.950
frequently used in spreadsheet analysis.

6
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.850
Let's explore nesting IF
statements in Problem 8A.

7
00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:31.285
Problem 8A first asks us
to identify the industry of

8
00:00:31.285 --> 00:00:34.730
distributed works in if
they sell products online.

9
00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.745
If the distributor does not sale products
online, we are asked to then determine

10
00:00:40.745 --> 00:00:45.090
the distributor's name if they
sell less than $500 of a product.

11
00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.990
You can see that this is
a multiple step IF-THEN analysis.

12
00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:57.490
We will break this into two IF statements
to simplify and confirm our logic,

13
00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.530
then combine them at the end
into one nested IF statement.

14
00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.000
Let's start by determining if
a distributor sells product online

15
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.290
using an IF statement.

16
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:17.610
Let's check the value of the sales
channel column to see if it is online.

17
00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.530
If it is, let's return
the industry of the distributor.

18
00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:28.920
If it is not, let's just let the IF
function return its default value,

19
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.690
which is false, by omitting this
last parameter of the IF function.

20
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.420
We see that, consistent with expectations,
we get an industry value for

21
00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:46.170
distributors who sell online and
a false value for those who do not.

22
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.680
Let's now wrap this in another IF function

23
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.713
to determine the distributor's name if
they sell less than $500 worth of product.

24
00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:05.110
We'll add the second IF function as the
second parameter to the first IF function,

25
00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.660
telling IF that we want it to
evaluate this second IF function

26
00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.430
only if the test in the first
IF function is false.

27
00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.360
We'll have our second IF function
determine whether revenue is less

28
00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.660
than $500

29
00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:27.920
and, if it is, return the value from the
distributor column of our exercise table.

30
00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:35.430
If revenue is not less than $500, let's
have the IF function return a blank value.

31
00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.840
If we scan the table, we see that there
is only one distributor who does not sell

32
00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.980
products online and has revenue less than
$500, and that is Infinity Tracking.

33
00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.430
We correctly see their name
returned from our IF function and

34
00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.790
correctly see blank values for the other
two distributors who do not sell online.

35
00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.131
For the two distributors
who do sell online,

36
00:03:02.131 --> 00:03:06.850
we correctly see their industry
returned from our IF function.

37
00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.720
We hope you're getting a sense of
the powerful ways you can combine logical

38
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.130
functions in your own
spreadsheet analysis.

39
00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.810
We suggest you refer to Excel's
documentation to learn all of the logical

40
00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:24.450
functions it offers and study ways to
combine these functions to apply complex,

41
00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.380
logical analysis of your own data.

42
00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:32.957
Now it's your turn to demonstrate
your understanding of nested

43
00:03:32.957 --> 00:03:36.203
IF functions by completing problem 8B.
