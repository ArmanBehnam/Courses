2
00:00:02.552 --> 00:00:09.920
We can combine the IF function
with other functions to make it

3
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.870
even more powerful in applying
IF- THEN calculations to our data.

4
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.730
Let's use the AND
function in conjunction with IF to apply

5
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.380
multiple criteria when performing
IF- THEN analysis on our data.

6
00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:33.380
Problem 6A asks us to determine whether
each of these product sales scenarios

7
00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.990
has met both the price target and
revenue target specified.

8
00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:40.790
We can use the AND

9
00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.360
function when specifying the logical
test of the IF function to achieve this.

10
00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.580
Let's parameterize the AND function first,

11
00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.700
and then wrap the IF function around it.

12
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.190
Let's first check if the unit price of
the product in the current row is greater

13
00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.440
than or equal to our target price value
as referenced by the named range.

14
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.290
Next, let's check if the revenue

15
00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.900
of the current row's product sales is
greater than or equal to target revenue.

16
00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.360
We can pause here to ensure that
our logical test is accurate and

17
00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.850
returns values consistent
with expectations.

18
00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.600
By breaking this into two steps,

19
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.370
we can minimize the likelihood of errors
in our compound IF formula later.

20
00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.720
We can see that our AND

21
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:41.450
formula is returning true when we
have met or exceeded both targets,

22
00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.960
and false if we have missed
either one of the targets.

23
00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.390
Now, let's wrap the IF function around
this to tidy up the output a bit.

24
00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.510
We'll use this AND statement as
the logical test for our IF function.

25
00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.570
And then output yes,
if we've met the target,

26
00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.120
and no, if we've not.

27
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.280
Notice that we could, if needed,
substitute additional functions for

28
00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.800
these values of yes and no.

29
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.510
If we needed to perform
additional calculations for

30
00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.060
when the sales target has been met or
missed respectively.

31
00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.510
By chaining these two logical functions,
IF and AND

32
00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.059
together, we can apply increasingly
complex logic in our analysis.

33
00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.450
Now, it's your turn to demonstrate
your understanding of IF and

34
00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.512
AND by completing problem 6B.
