2
00:00:05.184 --> 00:00:07.157
You'll recall that the AND

3
00:00:07.157 --> 00:00:12.570
function returns TRUE only if all of
the logical tests given to it are true.

4
00:00:13.715 --> 00:00:19.109
Otherwise, it returns FALSE, if any of
the logical tests given to it is false.

5
00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.158
The OR function, on the other hand,
will return TRUE,

6
00:00:23.158 --> 00:00:26.527
if any of the logical
tests given to it is true.

7
00:00:26.527 --> 00:00:30.785
And FALSE, only if all of the logical
tests given to it are false.

8
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:33.360
We can also couple the OR

9
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.050
function with IF to apply nuanced
IF- THEN logical tests on our data.

10
00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.340
Let's explore this with problem 7A.

11
00:00:44.652 --> 00:00:48.749
We are asked to identify if a distributor
does not sell products online.

12
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.810
We can do this by determining if
the distributor sells products from either

13
00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.400
the retail or direct channels.

14
00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.610
Let's start, as before,
by building the OR statement first.

15
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.190
OR takes, as parameters,
a list of logical tests for it to perform.

16
00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.660
Let's test if the sales channel
value is either direct or

17
00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.910
indirect and set it to work.

18
00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:23.666
We can see true values here when
the distributor sells either retail or

19
00:01:23.666 --> 00:01:28.491
direct, and
false values when they sell online.

20
00:01:28.491 --> 00:01:33.768
Now, as before,
let's wrap our IF function around this and

21
00:01:33.768 --> 00:01:38.426
output the distributors
name when they sell online,

22
00:01:38.426 --> 00:01:41.753
that is when our OR function is false.

23
00:01:41.753 --> 00:01:46.451
And the blank value, when they do
not sell online, that is when our OR

24
00:01:46.451 --> 00:01:48.490
function is true.

25
00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:54.212
There we have it, remember that we can
always perform additional calculations for

26
00:01:54.212 --> 00:01:58.149
each of the TRUE and
FALSE parameters of the IF function.

27
00:01:59.845 --> 00:02:04.679
Now it's your turn to demonstrate
your understanding of

28
00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:08.714
combining IF and OR
by completing problem 7B.
