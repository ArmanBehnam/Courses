00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:05.674
[SOUND] Let's explore
the use of Excel's SUMIFS

2
00:00:05.674 --> 00:00:13.680
function to summarize totals of our
data meeting different criteria.

3
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.505
Problem 3A asks us to
calculate total revenue for

4
00:00:17.505 --> 00:00:23.070
each of the products listed in
the product column of the exercise table.

5
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.830
SUMIFS syntax is similar
to that of COUNTIFS,

6
00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.280
but it asks us first for the range to
calculate a sum of values from, and

7
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.190
then it asks for
criteria to apply when summing that range.

8
00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.060
Let's calculate the sum of revenue for

9
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.629
each of the products in
column bravo of our table.

10
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.216
We'll parameterize SUMIFS
by first pointing it

11
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.759
to the revenue column of the data set,
as we want it to sum revenue.

12
00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:59.578
Next, let's sum only for
the product listed in column bravo,

13
00:00:59.578 --> 00:01:04.392
or the current row of the product
column of our exercise table.

14
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.407
We'll point SUMIFS to the product
column of the data set and

15
00:01:10.407 --> 00:01:15.310
then to the product column of our
exercise table, let's set it to work.

16
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.160
We see that the exercise table auto
fills our formula down the column.

17
00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.740
Let's validate our calculation
of total revenue for

18
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.960
sales of Pure Soft detergent
100 milliliter in the data set.

19
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.920
Let's filter down for the Pure Soft
detergent 100 milliliter product,

20
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.660
then quickly calculate the sum of revenues
by highlighting the resulting values

21
00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.030
in the revenue column of the data set

22
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.140
and checking the sum value in the status
bar at the bottom right corner

23
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.520
of the screen.

24
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.170
We see that there were

25
00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.920
indeed $3,024 in revenue generated
by sales of this product.

26
00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.940
The next part of the problem asks us to
calculate total revenue for all sales

27
00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.180
where there were fewer than
100 units sold.

28
00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:13.590
We can use SUMIFS in a manner
similar to the way we used COUNTIFS

29
00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.070
earlier in this module and
pass it criteria as string parameters.

30
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.100
We are still summing revenue, so

31
00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:26.240
let's point SUMIFS to the revenue
column of our dataset as the summary.

32
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:31.160
Next, let's have it look at
the quantity column of the dataset and,

33
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.590
as the third parameter, find
quantities less than one hundred

34
00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.680
by typing less than one hundred in quotes.

35
00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.030
Let's set SUMIF to work.

36
00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.470
We could validate the answer
against the data set

37
00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.880
by manually filtering it down
by using the number drop down.

38
00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.840
If we did, we'd see that we

39
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.750
generated $16,820 in revenues from
all sales of fewer than 100 items.

40
00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.820
Now it's your turn to demonstrate
your understanding of SUMIFS by

41
00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.668
completing problem #3B.

42
00:03:06.668 --> 00:03:12.518
