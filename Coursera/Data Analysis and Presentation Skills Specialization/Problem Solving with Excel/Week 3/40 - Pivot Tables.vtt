00:00:09.461 --> 00:00:13.386
Welcome everyone to our next lesson
which will be about pivot tables.

3
00:00:13.386 --> 00:00:18.267
Pivot tables allow you to extract and
summarize large detailed data sets and

4
00:00:18.267 --> 00:00:21.631
transform it into useful
easy to read information.

5
00:00:21.631 --> 00:00:25.852
Pivot tables also automate formulas and
functions such as sums or

6
00:00:25.852 --> 00:00:29.086
counts to create a summarized
table of your data.

7
00:00:29.086 --> 00:00:32.850
There are many benefits and
uses of pivot tables.

8
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.740
Pivot tables can be as simple or
as complicated as you need them to be.

9
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.675
They are useful to make a quick summary
table but can also be customized using

10
00:00:40.675 --> 00:00:43.890
self-formatting or
importing your own formulas.

11
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.820
In work settings, they are often used as
reports or dashboards that are extremely

12
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.870
useful for internal tracking, as well as
presentation material to show to clients.

13
00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.000
We'll get in to how to create a pivot
table once we get into our exercises but

14
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.200
the process is easy to learn because
the tools in Excel make it a very

15
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.040
visual process.

16
00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.480
Creating a pivot table is as
simple as highlighting your data,

17
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.800
clicking on the pivot table
function in the ribbon, and

18
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.120
clicking where you would
like the table to be.

19
00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.320
Lastly, you drag your items from the field
list to the appropriate filter, row, or

20
00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.410
column to make your table.

21
00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:23.760
So now we'll start off in question
1A to actually make a pivot table.

22
00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.320
So first, it's always important
to understand your data set.

23
00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.294
So we'll go to the data set tab,
where you see a table of sales information

24
00:01:31.294 --> 00:01:35.960
by distributor name, country,
product, sales channel and so on.

25
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.714
You've seen this sales data in
a few of our past Excel lessons.

26
00:01:40.714 --> 00:01:44.846
So the first step to making a pivot table
is highlighting our whole Data Set.

27
00:01:44.846 --> 00:01:50.834
So an easy way to do this, is to click
the top left cell, hit the control and

28
00:01:50.834 --> 00:01:56.841
shift key, and hold those and then hit
the right arrow and the down arrow.

29
00:01:56.841 --> 00:02:02.166
So you can see, we easily just
highlighted 110 rows of data.

30
00:02:02.166 --> 00:02:06.056
The next step is to go into the insert
ribbon and click Pivot Table and

31
00:02:06.056 --> 00:02:11.560
you'll see that the table that we just
highlighted is already in our table range.

32
00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.360
Below, you can see that pivot tables
will default to go to a new worksheet,

33
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.480
but since we have a worksheet
where we're working,

34
00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.020
I'm going to click Existing Worksheet and
click this button to select our cell.

35
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.240
I'll go to the section one create
pivot table and click right below and

36
00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.930
hit enter, and
now click OK to create the pivot table.

37
00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.120
On the right,
you can see the pivot table field list.

38
00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.440
You can choose out of the columns of your
data set what you want to be columns,

39
00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.030
rows, filters, or values,
in your pivot table.

40
00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.250
For example, let's say we wanted
to see revenue by country, so

41
00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.440
I'll click country and
you can see that it autopopulated to rows.

42
00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.530
If we wanted it as columns, we could drag
it over to columns, but you can see that

43
00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.340
doesn't look great, so I'm going to
put it back to the row section.

44
00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.426
And then I'm going to
scroll down to revenue, and

45
00:03:05.426 --> 00:03:08.500
it will autopopulate to values.

46
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.160
If you click the little
triangle next to your revenue,

47
00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.420
you'll see a value field settings option.

48
00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.330
In here you can choose sum,
count, average, or some

49
00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:23.150
of the other Excel functions but the pivot
table will try to guess what you want.

50
00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.650
In this case I do want a sum,
so I'll click OK, and

51
00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.980
now we can see that we have
the summary of revenue by country.

52
00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.560
It's always important to remember that
pivot tables do not update automatically.

53
00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.970
So you should always refresh your data
to ensure that your table is current.

54
00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.800
You can do that by going up to the analyze
ribbon in your pivot table tools and

55
00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.430
click Refresh.

56
00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.950
And you'll see that now we have
the most current pivot table.

57
00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.000
Additionally, you can change the data
that you are working with, and

58
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.960
you can do that by looking at
the PivotTable Tools ribbon again and

59
00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:02.660
click on Analyze, up here and
Change Data Source.

60
00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.790
So if we had another tab with another
data set, we could change the data source

61
00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.750
to provide the same pivot table
with the different set of data.

62
00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:15.820
Now in problem 1b, you can make
a pivot table with our sales data.

63
00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.725
Try moving around different
fields to the column, rows and

64
00:04:19.725 --> 00:04:23.716
values section to see how it
affects the pivot table output.

65
00:04:23.716 --> 00:04:33.716
