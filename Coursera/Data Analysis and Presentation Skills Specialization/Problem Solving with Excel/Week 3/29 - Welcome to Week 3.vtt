00:00:11.454 --> 00:00:16.084
Welcome back,
here we are already at Week Three.

3
00:00:16.084 --> 00:00:19.171
Did you see what I meant by taking your
basic knowledge to a higher level with

4
00:00:19.171 --> 00:00:20.159
more Excel functions?

5
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.080
Last week we talked about data cleansing.

6
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.930
It's particularly important because it
helps us make sure the data is ready to

7
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.160
use and it's going to give you the raw
material you need to do your analysis.

8
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.820
This week, we're going to look at two
important functions within Excel,

9
00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.010
logic statements and pivot tables.

10
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.770
Logic statements allow you to test
the contents of cells to see if they

11
00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.840
meet the criteria that
you have established.

12
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.620
This helps our analysis by giving
us the flexibility to choose or

13
00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.180
highlight different analytical paths.

14
00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.810
After looking a logic statements we're
going to explore a powerful tool

15
00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.460
within Excel called pivot tables.

16
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.210
A pivot table is an Excel tool
that allows you to summarize and

17
00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:06.850
explore data interactively.

18
00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.260
It takes data that's hard to understand
because of the sheer quantity of the data

19
00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.850
and lets you summarize it, making it
more manageable and more meaningful.

20
00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.460
Here's the great thing about pivot tables,
you can't break them.

21
00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.440
Once you've connected with the data set or
sets you need,

22
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.200
a pivot table can help you quickly slice
and dice that data without impacting it.

23
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.940
First we'll show you an example
of how this is done, and

24
00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.840
then you'll get the chance
to do it yourself.

25
00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.760
This week's content really moves
beyond basic functions in Excel,

26
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.419
to ways you can more effectively
use it to conduct analysis.

27
00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.340
The tools you'll be introduced
to will position you

28
00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:46.840
to better analyze information.

29
00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.300
Great job,
working through the content so far.

30
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.273
I'll be back next week to introduce
you to the final week of the course.
