2
00:00:05.252 --> 00:00:09.880
Next, we're going to get in to how
to navigate around our pivot tables.

3
00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.880
So, our first question here, 2a says,
what country has the most revenue?

4
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.859
So I'm going to go back to our Data Set
and we have the whole data highlighted and

5
00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:25.340
I'm going to go to the INSERT ribbon and
then PivotTable.

6
00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.410
And again, I'm going to move
this to an Existing Worksheet so

7
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.610
we can place it right under our prompt.

8
00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:35.600
I'll click on the button next to
the Location option, navigate to

9
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:42.190
section 2 -Navigating, and put this
in the cell right below our problem.

10
00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.610
I'll click Enter and then hit OK.

11
00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.250
And now we have our pivot table.

12
00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.030
To find out the answer to our question,

13
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.280
I'm going to populate the fields
with the country and revenue.

14
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.150
So, I'll click the box for country and

15
00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.780
you can see that it auto
populates in our row field.

16
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.220
And next, I'll take Revenue and
check that box and

17
00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.940
we can see in our value section
that we have the Sum of Revenue.

18
00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.030
You'll notice at this point
that it was very easy for

19
00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.040
us to find the two variables that
we're working within this problem.

20
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.180
A leading practice is to create detailed
column names before starting with a pivot

21
00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.360
table so
that we can clearly identify our variables

22
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.680
rather than having the default column
names of one, two, three, four and so on.

23
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.470
To find out in our pivot table which
country have the most revenue,

24
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.830
we could scroll through and
see if we could find out ourselves but

25
00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.110
that would be time consuming, so,
let's use a tool of the pivot table.

26
00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.450
I'm going to click the box next to Row
Labels and you'll see three sort options.

27
00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.800
There's two simple sort options,
sort A to Z and

28
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:56.280
sort Z to A and those will give
you a basic alphabetical sort.

29
00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.740
In this case, we want to sort by revenue.

30
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.650
So I'm going to click More Sort Options.

31
00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:07.060
Here again, you can see Ascending and
Descending and since we're trying to find

32
00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.630
the most revenue, I'll click Descending so
the most revenue is at the top.

33
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.870
And, I will change this from
Country to Sum of Revenue so

34
00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.730
we have a numerical sort rather than an
alphabetical one and then I'll click OK.

35
00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:29.150
And, we can see that France is at
the top with $3,016 of revenue.

36
00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.610
Next, try problem 2b, where it asks, what
are the top five countries by revenue?

37
00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.390
This next question we'll do together.

38
00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.870
Question 2c asks, who is the top
distributor in Panama by revenue?

39
00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.650
So, the value we're
looking at is revenue and

40
00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.590
the two other variables we're looking
at are distributors and countries.

41
00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.860
To answer this question again, we're going
to use our friendly tool, the pivot table.

42
00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.680
So I'm going to go through the steps
again to insert our pivot table.

43
00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.030
I'll go to the Data Set tab and
all of our data is highlighted.

44
00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.727
I'll hit INSERT in the ribbon and
click on PivotTable.

45
00:03:08.727 --> 00:03:14.560
Again, I will change our location to
the Existing Worksheet and move this

46
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.980
over to under our problem that we're
working on 2c and then I'll click OK.

47
00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.640
So, now we have our pivot table
to begin solving our problem.

48
00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.290
At this point, if you didn't want to go
through all the steps to create a brand

49
00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.510
new pivot table,
you can definitely just copy and

50
00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.760
paste one that you've already used as
long as the same data is being used.

51
00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.960
So now, let's figure out who is the top
distributor in Panama by revenue.

52
00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:44.260
So again, our three variables
are distributors, countries and revenue.

53
00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.440
So, let's start with Distributor Name.

54
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.860
I'm going to click the box and you can
see it came down to our ROW section.

55
00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.710
And next, let's think about the values.

56
00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.350
So the value we want to
look at is Revenue.

57
00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.940
So, I'll click on Revenue and

58
00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.900
again, we have the Sum of
Revenues in our VALUES section.

59
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.190
This next part is where it
can get a little more tricky.

60
00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.240
So at this point,

61
00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:14.350
we're going to use the FILTER function
in our PivotTable Field menu.

62
00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.800
So, I'm going to click on Country and
you can see,

63
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.920
that it automatically went
down to the row section.

64
00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.840
So, you can easily fix that just
by dragging it up to FILTERS.

65
00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.220
And now, we have a filter at
the top of our pivot table

66
00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.120
that allows us to pick which country
in particular we want to look at.

67
00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.770
So, I'm going to click the little
dialog box next to All,

68
00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.630
since we are currently looking
at all countries distributors.

69
00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:45.280
I'll scroll down to Panama,
click on that and

70
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:51.180
then click OK and now we can see that
we have three distributors from Panama.

71
00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.960
In this scenario,
we only have three distributors so,

72
00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.860
it's pretty easy to go through and
see which has the highest revenue.

73
00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.850
But, if we had a longer list
it might be time consuming and

74
00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:02.710
less efficient to do that.

75
00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:07.010
So, we can use the Sort function
that we did in our previous example.

76
00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:10.370
I'll click on the dialogue
box next to Row Labels and

77
00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:16.090
since we don't want a basic A to Z or Z to
Z sort, I will go to More Sort Options.

78
00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:23.000
And here, since we want the highest amount
of revenue on top I'll click Descending

79
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.320
and change our sort function to
Sum of Revenue and click OK.

80
00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.900
So now, we have the data sorted

81
00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.900
with the individual with the most
revenue up top and that is Maxine.

82
00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.240
This next question,
2d is for you to solve.

83
00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:43.820
Who is the top distributor of Detafast
Stain Remover- 200ml by units sold?

84
00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:47.680
Remember to keep the relevant variables in
mind while you're making your pivot table

85
00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.930
and also try using the filter function or

86
00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:54.550
sort feature if you think that'll help
you solve the problem efficiently.

87
00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:59.870
2e is the last example we
work together in this section.

88
00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.920
What are the four products
that solve the most units?

89
00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:07.030
To solve this, we'll create a pivot table
again using the same substance as before.

90
00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:11.550
We'll go into Data Set, the whole
data set is already highlighted, so

91
00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:15.380
I'll go up to INSERT and then PivotTable.

92
00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:18.850
Again, I'll move this to the worksheet
that we're working on the problem,

93
00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:24.150
click the cell where I'd like
the pivot table, hit Enter and

94
00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:26.420
then, looks good so I'll hit OK.

95
00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:32.550
For this question, our relevant
variables are Products and unit sold.

96
00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:37.670
So, I'm going to take Product and
put it in our rows and

97
00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:42.030
then I'll take Quantity which
represents the units sold and

98
00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:45.940
that will default as the Sum of
Quantity in our VALUES field.

99
00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:50.330
I'm going to go through the same process
as we did in our previous examples

100
00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:54.540
to move the highest quantities
to the top and sort by that.

101
00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:59.320
I'll click the button next to Row Labels
and go to More Sort Options and

102
00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:04.560
then I'll click Descending and
change this to Sum of Quantity.

103
00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.910
And, you'll see the Summary down here as a

104
00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:11.120
quick little way to check to make sure
you're doing what you'd like to do.

105
00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:14.700
It says, Sort Product by Sum of
Quantity in descending order.

106
00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:17.940
So, I'll hit OK and

107
00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:22.840
we can see the top four products
easily shown in our pivot table.

108
00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:28.240
The next three problems, 2f,
2g, and 2h are for you to try.

109
00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:31.943
Keep in mind all of the things
we went through together and

110
00:07:31.943 --> 00:07:35.339
also remember how beneficial
these tools could be in

111
00:07:35.339 --> 00:07:39.831
a real life setting if you have a large
data set and problems to solve.

112
00:07:39.831 --> 00:07:44.183
