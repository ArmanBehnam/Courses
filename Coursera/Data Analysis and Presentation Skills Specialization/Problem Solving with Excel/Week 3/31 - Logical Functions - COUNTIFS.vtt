2
00:00:05.933 --> 00:00:12.260
Some summary functions exist within Excel
to aggregate data on a conditional basis.

3
00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.455
Ones important such functions is COUNTIFS.

4
00:00:15.455 --> 00:00:19.430
COUNTIFS allows you to count
the number of occurrences

5
00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.700
of a specific condition
across a range of data.

6
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.860
Let's use COUNTIFS to answer
the questions in problem 1a.

7
00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.960
Problem 1a asks us to
find the number of sales

8
00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.040
of each of the products
listed in column bravo.

9
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.737
COUNTIFS takes as parameters the range
of data you wish to count from,

10
00:00:41.737 --> 00:00:46.535
and the criteria to satisfy when
counting values in that range.

11
00:00:46.535 --> 00:00:51.607
Let's point COUNTIFS from our
product column of the dataset

12
00:00:51.607 --> 00:00:55.989
using the value in cell bravo 12 and
set it to work.

13
00:01:06.207 --> 00:01:11.134
You'll notice the clarity that structured
references provide our formulas,

14
00:01:11.134 --> 00:01:14.737
as Excel has intelligently
substituted the table name and

15
00:01:14.737 --> 00:01:19.901
column name along with some special syntax
for the typical cell references we see.

16
00:01:19.901 --> 00:01:24.209
We could type these values into
the COUNTIFS formula directly using tab

17
00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:28.252
completion and going forward,
we may do this out of convenience.

18
00:01:32.435 --> 00:01:36.743
You'll also notice that because we
have formatted the problem table as

19
00:01:36.743 --> 00:01:40.332
an Excel table,
the formula automatically fills down when

20
00:01:40.332 --> 00:01:42.860
we type it into the first
cell of a column.

21
00:01:45.735 --> 00:01:50.256
Let's validate our answers manually to
confirm that we've calculated what we

22
00:01:50.256 --> 00:01:51.072
intended to.

23
00:01:51.072 --> 00:01:54.860
This is a good practice for
your own spreadsheet analysis.

24
00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.549
We see that COUNTIFS counted 11
sales of the pure soft detergent

25
00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.689
100 milliliter product.

26
00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.955
If we pop back over to the dataset,

27
00:02:04.955 --> 00:02:08.190
we can filter on this value
to validate our answer.

28
00:02:12.587 --> 00:02:17.068
We see that indeed there were
11 sales of the 100 milliliter

29
00:02:17.068 --> 00:02:21.951
detergent product as verified by
the count value in the bottom right side

30
00:02:21.951 --> 00:02:26.295
of the status bar of Excel when
we highlight the filtered cells.

31
00:02:34.297 --> 00:02:38.163
The next part of our problem asks
us to count the number of sales for

32
00:02:38.163 --> 00:02:40.570
which revenue meets certain criteria.

33
00:02:41.635 --> 00:02:45.199
COUNTIFS can be used to quickly
calculate such summaries.

34
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.180
We can pass COUNTIFS building in tests

35
00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.140
to apply against values in
the range we are counting from.

36
00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.450
Let's see how this works.

37
00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:01.740
If we want to count the sales which
resulted in more than $1,000 in revenue,

38
00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.510
we first pass COUNTIFS the range
of values to count from.

39
00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.240
In this case the revenue
column of our data table.

40
00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.780
Next, we posit the criteria to evaluate.

41
00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.204
In this case, a string of text, the syntax
of which should feel very familiar.

42
00:03:18.204 --> 00:03:22.332
It's greater than 1,000 in quotes,

43
00:03:22.332 --> 00:03:23.921
and then we set the formula to work.

44
00:03:30.527 --> 00:03:35.323
Let's validate our answer against the
dataset by filtering down revenue values

45
00:03:35.323 --> 00:03:37.380
for those greater than 1000.

46
00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.330
Excel provides a simple
way to filter by number.

47
00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.020
Let's select the number
filters option from

48
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.969
the filter drop down on
the revenue column of the dataset.

49
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:54.180
Then we'll select greater than, and
type 1,000 into the dialog box.

50
00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:02.452
We see that, indeed, there were 27 sales
which produced revenues of $1,000 or more.

51
00:04:08.437 --> 00:04:13.478
We can copy this formula to the next
cell and make one small change, and

52
00:04:13.478 --> 00:04:19.729
answer the question of how many sales
resulted in revenues of less than $1,000.

53
00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:24.154
Let's quickly change the greater than
symbol to a less than symbol and

54
00:04:24.154 --> 00:04:25.580
set COUNTIFS to work.

55
00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:39.458
We can validate our answer in
a similar fashion as previously and

56
00:04:39.458 --> 00:04:44.461
confirm that there 80 sales less than $1000.

57
00:04:44.461 --> 00:04:49.080
We'll select the less than option from the
number filter's dropdown menu this time.

58
00:04:59.746 --> 00:05:03.354
We can copy this formula
again to the next cell and

59
00:05:03.354 --> 00:05:08.282
make another small change to
answer the question of how many cells

60
00:05:08.282 --> 00:05:12.166
resulted in revenues
exactly equal to $1000.

61
00:05:12.166 --> 00:05:18.647
Let's quickly change the less than symbol,
and set COUNTIFS to work.

62
00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:25.980
We can validate our answer in
a similar fashion as previously.

63
00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:31.600
And confirm that there were no sales
resulting in revenues equal to $1000.

64
00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:37.576
We'll select the equals option from the
number filter's drop-down menu this time.

65
00:05:49.326 --> 00:05:54.090
We can copy this formula to the next
cell and make another small change,

66
00:05:54.090 --> 00:06:01.167
to answer the question of how many sales
resulted in revenues not equal to $1000.

67
00:06:01.167 --> 00:06:06.869
Let's quickly change the less than symbol,
and set COUNTIFS to work.

68
00:06:12.829 --> 00:06:17.531
We can validate our answer in
a similar fashion as previously and

69
00:06:17.531 --> 00:06:23.984
confirm that there were 107 sales
resulting in revenues not equal to $1,000.

70
00:06:23.984 --> 00:06:28.775
We'll select the does not equal option
from the number filters drop down menu

71
00:06:28.775 --> 00:06:29.521
this time.

72
00:06:46.092 --> 00:06:50.707
Now it's your turn to demonstrate
your understanding of COUNTIFS by

73
00:06:50.707 --> 00:06:52.465
completing problem 1b.

74
00:06:55.125 --> 00:07:00.298
