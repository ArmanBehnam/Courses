2
00:00:05.081 --> 00:00:08.716
In this next section we're going to
go over how to sort a pivot table.

3
00:00:08.716 --> 00:00:11.769
So we've looked at this a little and
some of our past examples but

4
00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:15.840
there are even more sort functions
that we haven't gotten into yet.

5
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:16.920
In problem 4a,

6
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.510
we're going to sort the distributors
in alphabetical order by first name.

7
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.300
So it looks like here we have
the distributors from Panama and

8
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.880
their revenue.

9
00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:32.500
So I'll click the dialog box next to
distributor to show our sort functions.

10
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.640
And currently since Sort Z
to A is highlighted,

11
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.180
it looks like that is what we're using.

12
00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.460
But we want this in alphabetical order, so
I'm going to change this to Sort A to Z.

13
00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.830
And now we can see that we have our table
in alphabetical order by first name.

14
00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:51.740
Now problem 4b is a little more
complicated because we have the quantity

15
00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.630
of products broken down by sales channel.

16
00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.260
Here, the question is asking us
to sort both the products and

17
00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.180
the sales channel in descending
order by sum of quantity.

18
00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.840
Just as in our past example,

19
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.820
we can click the dialogue box next
to Products to see our sort options.

20
00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.236
Here, you can see that there's
already a Select Field option.

21
00:01:12.236 --> 00:01:17.585
Though this menu is helpful it's always
better to look at the more sort option,

22
00:01:17.585 --> 00:01:19.735
so you can see all of your options and

23
00:01:19.735 --> 00:01:22.945
what is the easiest way to
go about sorting your data.

24
00:01:22.945 --> 00:01:26.965
So here you can see the options,
ascending and descending, and

25
00:01:26.965 --> 00:01:29.795
we would like to sort descending order.

26
00:01:29.795 --> 00:01:34.485
On the top of this menu, it says
select field and has a drop down menu.

27
00:01:34.485 --> 00:01:39.380
The drop down menu shows both
sales channel and product.

28
00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.380
So this is what we are going to sort by.

29
00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.880
In our example, we would like to
sort products and sales channel.

30
00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.070
So lets start with product.

31
00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.280
I'll click on Product to tell Excel
that we would like to sort by product.

32
00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:59.200
Next, I'll go to More Sort Options, and we
would like to sort it in descending order,

33
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.860
so I'm going to click for Descending.

34
00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.020
And what would we like to sort by?

35
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.380
So you can see in the summary
below right now we

36
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.325
are sorting product in descending order,

37
00:02:10.325 --> 00:02:14.485
but we would like to sort
product by Sum of quantity.

38
00:02:14.485 --> 00:02:19.575
So this drop down menu allows us to
sort product by sum of quantity,

39
00:02:19.575 --> 00:02:22.710
and you can see that that
is updated in our summary.

40
00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.090
So now I'm going to click
OK to update those changes.

41
00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.770
This pivot table now shows products sorted
in descending order by sum of quantity.

42
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.530
The next step will be to sort
sales channel in descending order

43
00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.060
by sum of quantity.

44
00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.840
To do this let's return to our sort menu.

45
00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.520
I'm going to click the button
next to products again, and

46
00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.460
here when we select field we would
like to select Sales Channel.

47
00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.350
The next step is to go to
the more sort options menu.

48
00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.730
Question 4b asks for
a descending order by sum of quantity.

49
00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.190
So I'll click Descending and
then change this to Sum of Quantity.

50
00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.190
And we can see in our summary,

51
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.140
we are sorting sales channel by Sum
of Quantity in descending order.

52
00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.230
So I'm going to click OK.

53
00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.130
Our resulting pivot table
has online retail and

54
00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.510
direct, our sales channel,
in descending order by sum of quantity,

55
00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.440
as well as the products within those
sales channels in descending order.

56
00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.750
In problem 4c,
it's your turn to try sorting.

57
00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.610
Sort countries and products in
descending order by sum of revenue.

58
00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.240
If you're having any trouble,
try guessing and checking.

59
00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.019
Good luck.

60
00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:39.174
