00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:15.300
Hello, and
welcome to the final week of the course.

3
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.000
Your final week will be
something a little different.

4
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.770
This week, we're giving you the
opportunity to apply what you've learned

5
00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.670
and demonstrate it in
two final assignments.

6
00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.200
>> First, we're going to introduce
you to an interactive simulation.

7
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.220
In this simulation, you'll have a chance
to interact with fictional clients.

8
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.640
You will learn the business
opportunity and challenges they face.

9
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.020
>> This simulation gives you
the opportunity to demonstrate

10
00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.710
what you've learned by making
decisions that get you closer or

11
00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.510
farther away from a successful outcome.

12
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.090
Your choices in the simulation
determine your path and final results.

13
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.280
Next, we're going to ask you
to complete a course project.

14
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.270
This project will also give you
an opportunity to demonstrate

15
00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:57.800
what you've learned.

16
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.480
>> On the course site we've placed three
business scenarios for the project.

17
00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.087
You can select one of these scenarios or

18
00:01:04.087 --> 00:01:07.492
you can choose one from
your own current business.

19
00:01:07.492 --> 00:01:12.448
From your scenarios we're asking you to
find as much information as possible about

20
00:01:12.448 --> 00:01:16.858
the organization or situation and
put together a plan for data analysis.

21
00:01:16.858 --> 00:01:21.343
Your plan should address all the elements
of the data analytics framework and

22
00:01:21.343 --> 00:01:25.012
any other considerations
you think are important.

23
00:01:25.012 --> 00:01:28.860
>> Once you've completed your plan,
you will post it on the course site.

24
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.140
There your peers will review your plan and
give you a score.

25
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.750
We've built a rubric into the course so
that all scoring is consistent and fair.

26
00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.310
We're asking each learner to review
three of their peers' plans.

27
00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.990
You'll find detailed instructions
within the assignment on the site.

28
00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.360
>> We hope you enjoy
this week's activities.

29
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.695
It will give you a chance to show what
you've learned in a way that is engaging

30
00:01:53.695 --> 00:01:54.661
and impactful.

31
00:01:54.661 --> 00:01:56.980
