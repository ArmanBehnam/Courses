You've done it.

4
00:00:13.588 --> 00:00:18.480
You've now completed the introduction
to Data Driven Decision Making course.

5
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.450
In the specialization,
data analysis and presentation skills.

6
00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:23.180
The PWC approach.

7
00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.170
>> In this first course you took part in
a high level exploration in the field

8
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.900
of data and analytics.

9
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.610
You heard from some of our
PWC leaders in the area and

10
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.660
learned how they applied data and
analytics to solve real client issues.

11
00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.660
>> Through a series of videos, readings,
assessments, a practice simulation,

12
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.380
and a course project, you explored key
topic areas in data and analytics.

13
00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.390
In week one,
we discussed how organizations

14
00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.850
used the data analytics
framework to solve problems.

15
00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.130
You learned about the different
careers and roles in the field.

16
00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.990
And you explored some of
the technology advancements

17
00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.780
that are impacting how we capture and
use data.

18
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.350
>> In addition to being
an essential foundation,

19
00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.850
the ability to capture insights and
express them with clarity to tell a story

20
00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.910
is a real differentiator in people's
careers Week two focused on

21
00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.300
the different types of data available
that are used to solve business problems.

22
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.620
You learned more about emerging trends and
data analytics, and explored

23
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.960
the differences between structured,
unstructured, and semi-structured data.

24
00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.880
>> In week three,
we looked at how data is studied.

25
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.040
We talked about the different types of
analysis techniques you can perform.

26
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.940
We explored some of
the tools that are used,

27
00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:44.580
like R, Python, Tableaux,
Click View, Excel, and SAS.

28
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.049
We also looked at visualizations
that help your data tell a story.

29
00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.510
>> Then, once you've got the data,
you need to have the skills, tools, and

30
00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.410
the ability to ask the right questions and
do something with it.

31
00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.980
>> Finally, we gave you the opportunity
to show what you had learned through

32
00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.190
an interactive simulation and
your course project.

33
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.220
You also had the chance to see what your
peers created with their projects and

34
00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.210
to provide feedback.

35
00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.030
>> We hope you found this course to be
an insightful introduction to data and

36
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.100
analytics.

37
00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.790
We also hope that you continue
on with the full specialization.

38
00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.528
Data analysis and
presentation skills the PWC approach,

39
00:02:23.528 --> 00:02:27.100
where you'll have an opportunity to
further develop and apply data and

40
00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.590
analytic skills to solve
business problems.

41
00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.450
In upcoming courses we're going to
look at problem solving using Excel,

42
00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.010
creating data visualization
with advanced Excel,

43
00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.450
and creating effective business
