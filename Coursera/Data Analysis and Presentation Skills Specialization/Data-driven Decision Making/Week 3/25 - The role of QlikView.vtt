00:00:11.307 --> 00:00:15.959
In this video, we're going to look at
a data visualization tool called QlikView.

3
00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:19.900
You'll learn what QlikView is,
when, and why to use it.

4
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.780
Let's start with an overview.

5
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.910
QlikView is an analytics and visualization
tool for advanced data investigation.

6
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.810
QlikView allows you to
bring in all of your data

7
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.850
from different sources to
create visualizations.

8
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.375
This allows decision makers to
see their data in real time,

9
00:00:37.375 --> 00:00:41.420
to find opportunities, and
make changes where needed.

10
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.590
QlikView is similar to dev low, but
it can be used for more complex analytics.

11
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.560
You can create graphs and
charts on the front end,

12
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.230
and the user can interact with that
data and slice it and dice it.

13
00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.440
The interface of the software
is easy to understand, and

14
00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.880
is likely to target more
professional users, or power users.

15
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.830
The software is flexible and customizable,
with its programmable BI platform.

16
00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.540
Not only can the user develop
new types of charts, but

17
00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.520
using functions, the user can save
part of the work for later use.

18
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.310
Users can use clip view either for
analytic purpose, with ad hoc analysis and

19
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.140
predictable analytics,

20
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.920
as well as reporting features like ad hoc
reporting and customizable dashboards.

21
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.330
The software can support
multiple data sources

22
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.380
which gives it the ability
to do complex analysis.

23
00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.550
My colleague, Rammy Cedra,

24
00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.129
is going to talk about how his team
uses QlikView to solve client problems.

25
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.930
>> Hi, I'm Ramy Sedra.

26
00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.090
My team and I worked with
the organizations to turn data

27
00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.360
into actionable insights.

28
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.712
While working with the financial services
organization they want it to optimize

29
00:01:53.712 --> 00:01:56.276
the channel that our
clients were assigned to.

30
00:01:56.276 --> 00:02:00.092
A channel is a branch,
private banking, or tele-banking team.

31
00:02:00.092 --> 00:02:04.360
So we leverage collect to build a decision
tree, the statistical model, and

32
00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.629
to analyze and optimize the allocation
of clients to channels based on client

33
00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:13.580
segments, product portfolio, geography,
and other related client and market data.

34
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.860
We use the data from the financial
institution, some geospatial data,

35
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.690
census data, and other proprietary
data sets to perform the analysis,

36
00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.380
build the model, and the visualizations.

37
00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.770
We did this work in
approximately six weeks.

38
00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.440
So the agility of the tool was
really a big factor in our success.

39
00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.130
Qlik enabled us to rapidly pull the data
together, the links between datasets and

40
00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.150
show the visualizations in
a compelling in interactive manner.

41
00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.660
The value to the client is that
they can quickly see the insights

42
00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.900
from the analysis and
really paints the picture.

43
00:02:47.985 --> 00:02:51.100
Qlik leaves the client with
a tool they can interact with.

44
00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.830
They can perform their own analysis,

45
00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.870
think of more questions that they
can answer with their own data.

46
00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.930
It really closes the gap
between the business users.

47
00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.790
And the insights hidden in the data.

48
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.610
One of the benefits of using Qlick is that
it can integrated with other softwares

49
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:11.790
such as SAP, Microsoft SQL server,
Oracle, Excel.

50
00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.520
And as a result, gaining access to a broad
set of data is really quite simple and

51
00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:17.899
can be done cost effectively.

52
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.160
Another benefit of collect is that
it can be used to create a complete

53
00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.390
BI infrastructure needed for
advanced reporting, dashboards that leads,

54
00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.860
and supports really complex analysis.

55
00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.850
The Qlik interface is easy to use and
easy to understand.

56
00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.360
That's likely to be adopted by
business users and power users alike.

57
00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.970
The software is flexible, customizable,
with it's programmable, and

58
00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.810
analytic platform.

59
00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.410
Not only can the users develop new
types of charts, and visualizations.

60
00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.270
But they can save their work for
later use.

61
00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:55.510
The calculation in Qlik is very powerful.

62
00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.610
The tool can handle large data
volumes without impacting performance

63
00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.650
thanks to it's in memory features.

64
00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.190
Qlik's mobile solution is quite
interactive and easy to use.

65
00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.430
Collaborative features such
as chat are very powerful for

66
00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.790
sharing insights amongst
a group of stakeholders.

67
00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.870
While Qlik is a great tool, for even more
compelling visualizations you may want to

68
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.312
consider exploring Qlik Sense,
Qlik's softwares other product.

69
00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.730
These our some of the benefits of
using QlikView to visualize your data.

70
00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:27.630
>> Thanks, Ramy.

71
00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.536
So now you have a high level understanding
of the world QlikView in data and

72
00:04:31.536 --> 00:04:32.231
analytics.

73
