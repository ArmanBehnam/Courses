00:00:11.155 --> 00:00:16.102
Hello, my name is Eddie Valaitis and I am
a Director in PwC's Advisory Pharma and

3
00:00:16.102 --> 00:00:18.376
Life Sciences Analytics Practice.

4
00:00:18.376 --> 00:00:19.605
Before joining PwC,

5
00:00:19.605 --> 00:00:23.641
I was a tenure track professor of
statistics at American University.

6
00:00:23.641 --> 00:00:26.388
Now I focus on farmer research and
development,

7
00:00:26.388 --> 00:00:29.671
applying my theoretical statistics and
machine learning

8
00:00:29.671 --> 00:00:33.900
knowledge to a diverse set of complex
issues facing our by pharma clients.

9
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.393
These issues range from wrangling and
standardizing large datasets.

10
00:00:38.393 --> 00:00:41.729
Accelerating drug development
by identifying those spacious of

11
00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:44.710
populations more responsive
to particular treatments.

12
00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.849
Accessing toxicity across specific
drug platforms and developing, and

13
00:00:48.849 --> 00:00:52.800
implementing enterprise wide
clinical trial modernize solutions.

14
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.139
In this video, I'm going to talk
to you about our R in RStudio.

15
00:00:57.139 --> 00:01:00.747
I'll describe what the tools are,
what they are used for and

16
00:01:00.747 --> 00:01:05.156
I'll share a client example where R
was used to solve a business problem.

17
00:01:05.156 --> 00:01:06.441
Why do we like R?

18
00:01:06.441 --> 00:01:09.447
R is an open-source software
environment and language for

19
00:01:09.447 --> 00:01:11.558
statistical computing, and graphics.

20
00:01:11.558 --> 00:01:16.769
Open-source means that the language is
freely available and may be distributed

21
00:01:16.769 --> 00:01:21.837
and modified by anyone, so that R has
a very active contributor and user base.

22
00:01:21.837 --> 00:01:24.479
R is the leading statistical
analysis package,

23
00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.613
as it allows the import of data from
multiple sources and multiple formats.

24
00:01:28.613 --> 00:01:34.579
For example, flat files, SAS files and
direct connect to graph databases.

25
00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:37.459
In addition to data
management capabilities,

26
00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:41.566
R contains over 7,000 specialist
packages that are all free.

27
00:01:41.566 --> 00:01:45.609
These packages allow users to
employ cutting-edge statistics,

28
00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:51.220
econometrics, optimization, machine
learning and simulation techniques.

29
00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.895
These all makes are the leading analytics
language in academia and industry.

30
00:01:55.895 --> 00:01:59.675
There's also a set of integrated
tools design to help you be more

31
00:01:59.675 --> 00:02:00.872
productive with R.

32
00:02:00.872 --> 00:02:06.130
It's a powerful and user-friendly
graphics user interface called RStudio.

33
00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.130
RStudio includes a console,

34
00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.100
syntax highlighting editor that supports
direct code execution as well as tools for

35
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.020
plotting, history, debugging and
workspace management.

36
00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:23.420
More specifically, RStudio includes
integrated R help and documentation.

37
00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.879
The ability to easily manage multiple
working directories using projects.

38
00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:31.006
A workspace browser and data viewer, and

39
00:02:31.006 --> 00:02:35.932
and interactive debugger to diagnose,
and fix errors quickly.

40
00:02:35.932 --> 00:02:39.728
RStudio allows users to
annotate code more fully.

41
00:02:39.728 --> 00:02:41.481
Debug code more easily.

42
00:02:41.481 --> 00:02:46.125
View data in spreadsheet format and
see all objects defined in a session.

43
00:02:46.125 --> 00:02:47.110
What's more?

44
00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.612
RStudio allows users to employ packages
for automated Word or PDF report

45
00:02:51.612 --> 00:02:57.360
generation and also contains a powerful
visualization plugin called Shining.

46
00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.504
Shiny allows development of iterative and
flexible visualizations, and

47
00:03:01.504 --> 00:03:05.856
dashboards that can be accessed by
non-programmers via internet browsers.

48
00:03:05.856 --> 00:03:08.350
As mentioned earlier, R is a powerful and

49
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:13.197
flexible analytics tool that can be used
to implement various data management,

50
00:03:13.197 --> 00:03:16.350
statistical analysis and
machine learning tasks.

51
00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.540
We could spend years going over all the
years all of the methods implemented in R,

52
00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.480
but I will highlight some of
the most commonly used R features.

53
00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.637
For data management,
R is used for importing data,

54
00:03:27.637 --> 00:03:32.954
assessing data quality by identifying data
qualifiers, implausible information and

55
00:03:32.954 --> 00:03:36.859
missing observations,
merging data as well as stacking data.

56
00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:38.171
In summary statistics,

57
00:03:38.171 --> 00:03:42.612
R helps create routine summary statistics
describing distribution of a variable.

58
00:03:42.612 --> 00:03:47.160
For example, means, medians,
standard deviations and skewness.

59
00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.502
For statistical tests,
R produces means tests, proportion tests,

60
00:03:51.502 --> 00:03:56.003
association tests, distributional
tests and tests of stationarity.

61
00:03:56.003 --> 00:04:00.905
In regression models, R is used for
ordinary regressions, logistic regression,

62
00:04:00.905 --> 00:04:05.807
stepwise regressions, ridge regressions,
analysis of variance, multivariate

63
00:04:05.807 --> 00:04:10.588
adaptive regression splines, support
vector machine nonlinear regressions.

64
00:04:10.588 --> 00:04:14.416
For clustering, R is used k-means,
partitioning around medoids and

65
00:04:14.416 --> 00:04:16.720
hierarchical clustering.

66
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.415
In dimensionality reduction,
R works in principal components and

67
00:04:20.415 --> 00:04:22.049
multidimensional scaling.

68
00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:26.502
And in decision trees and random forests,
R supports classification,

69
00:04:26.502 --> 00:04:29.717
regression and survival trees and
random forests.

70
00:04:29.717 --> 00:04:32.498
The flexibility of R makes
it the top choice for

71
00:04:32.498 --> 00:04:37.574
executing complex data management and
statistical analysis client engagements.

72
00:04:37.574 --> 00:04:41.594
For example, a leading by far more
organizations sought our help

73
00:04:41.594 --> 00:04:45.552
in aggregating and
standardizing data across a drug platform.

74
00:04:45.552 --> 00:04:50.376
Our goal was to identify tumor gene
expression cut points associated with

75
00:04:50.376 --> 00:04:54.425
differentiated survival outcomes
to develop an interactive

76
00:04:54.425 --> 00:04:59.196
visualization solution for
cut point identification and validation.

77
00:04:59.196 --> 00:05:04.898
R was a natural choice for this engagement
as it allowed us to quickly import assess,

78
00:05:04.898 --> 00:05:09.419
standardize and aggregate data
that were messy and incongruous.

79
00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:13.586
For example, data had missing
variable labels, missing values,

80
00:05:13.586 --> 00:05:17.689
multiple unit measurements for
the same variable across trials.

81
00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:22.088
We then wanted to identify important
genes associated with survival after

82
00:05:22.088 --> 00:05:24.533
accounting for confounding clinical and

83
00:05:24.533 --> 00:05:29.445
demographic covariance using the random
forest technique for survival objects.

84
00:05:29.445 --> 00:05:34.330
We then identified gene expression
cut points using survival trees.

85
00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.620
We then followed it up with
cogs proportional hazards and

86
00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.450
a number of more advanced barometric
survival models to assess whether

87
00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:46.160
the identified cut points were associated
with differentiated survival outputs.

88
00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.289
To bring all of the analysis to life,

89
00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:52.550
we use an interactive Shiny visualization
that then allowed the client to

90
00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:57.309
independently identify genes in their cut
points without having to program an R.

91
00:05:57.309 --> 00:06:01.404
As you can see in our examples, R is
an important tool for data management,

92
00:06:01.404 --> 00:06:04.660
analytics, statistical modeling and
machine learning.

93
00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:07.587
So, we've covered a lot of
materials in this segment.

94
00:06:07.587 --> 00:06:10.084
If some of the terms
were not familiar to you,

95
00:06:10.084 --> 00:06:12.465
be sure to reference the course glossary.

96
00:06:12.465 --> 00:06:18.541
