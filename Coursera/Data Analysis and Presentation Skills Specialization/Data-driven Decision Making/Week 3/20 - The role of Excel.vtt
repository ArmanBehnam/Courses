2
00:00:11.064 --> 00:00:15.301
In this video we're going to look at
the role of Excel in data and analytics.

3
00:00:15.301 --> 00:00:19.159
Excel has been around for a long time,
and many viewer as the first tool to

4
00:00:19.159 --> 00:00:22.651
learn when you're starting out
in the data and analytics field.

5
00:00:22.651 --> 00:00:26.392
The next two courses in this
specialization will go into detail on

6
00:00:26.392 --> 00:00:29.620
exactly what Excel can do and
how you can use it.

7
00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:34.130
In this video, I'm going to talk at a high
level on what the tool is, how it's used,

8
00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:35.950
and what types of problems it can solve.

9
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.920
Excel is a spreadsheet
developed by Microsoft.

10
00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.230
It has calculation,
graphics tools, pivot tables, and

11
00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.620
a macro programming language called
Visual Basic for Applications, VBA.

12
00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.565
Excel lets you organize numeric or
text-base data in spreadsheets or

13
00:00:52.565 --> 00:00:53.720
workbooks.

14
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.750
You can take raw data and
organize it and rearrange it, so

15
00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.230
that you can perform complex
analysis of the data.

16
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.600
To visualize your data, Excel allows you
to create different types of charts,

17
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.690
including line and column charts, or
add miniature graphs called sparkline.

18
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.660
You can also use Excel to apply
a table style, create pivot tables,

19
00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.390
quickly insert totals, and
apply conditional formatting.

20
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.920
So, why would you use Excel,
when there are so many more robust and

21
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.470
analytics tool available?

22
00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.210
Here are some of the key
benefits of Excel.

23
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.810
It's easy to use.

24
00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.600
It's extremely versatile.

25
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.970
It's dynamic, making it easy to
explore "what if?" scenarios.

26
00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:40.100
Complex data can be presented in
a clear and visually appealing way.

27
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.470
It can automate data processing.

28
00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.570
It integrates with Microsoft Office.

29
00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.370
And of course, everybody has it.

30
00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.690
Excel is a very common tool for
data and analytics.

31
00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.570
There are many, many options out there
that you'll learn about in this course,

32
00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.610
but Excel is an excellent one to start
with in your career in data and analytics.

33
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.540
It can be used to analyze data
in many different job types for

34
00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.820
different reasons, and
many of the Excel skills you will learn

35
00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.420
translate to more advanced
tools in the industry.

36
00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.760
Here's an example of how we used Excel to
combine sales data by distribution channel

37
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.530
to look at growth opportunities
by product and country for

38
00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.870
a medical device organization.

39
00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.247
We combined their historical data along
with macroeconomic data, and developed

40
00:02:24.247 --> 00:02:28.930
models that allowed the company to predict
sales based on varying assumptions.

41
00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.380
These models were also displayed in
graphs, and BBA was used to provide a user

42
00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.460
interface that allows the client to
toggle between the views and produce

43
00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.210
multiple scenarios based on varying
assumptions for comparison purposes.

44
00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.710
In this video, we discussed the role
of Excel in data analytics.

45
00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:50.730
Excel is an easy to use tool
that is extremely versatile.

46
00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.036
Learning Excel will make it much easier
for you to pick up more complex data and

47
00:02:55.036 --> 00:02:56.833
analytics tools in the future.

48
00:02:56.833 --> 00:03:03.091
