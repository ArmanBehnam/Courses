00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:12.619
Hi, I'm Amy Peirce.

3
00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:15.634
And at PwC,
I'm lucky enough to use advanced data and

4
00:00:15.634 --> 00:00:19.540
analytics to bring insights
to our clients every day.

5
00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.970
In this video, we're going to
talk about data visualization.

6
00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.450
Data and analytics is all about
bringing client challenges to life so

7
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.730
we can overcome them by taking data,
whether structured or unstructured and

8
00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.180
turning it into usable information and
insights.

9
00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.310
All the sophisticated data and
analytics in the world won't matter

10
00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.680
if it can't be consumed by an end user or
decision maker.

11
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.490
Think about the data and

12
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:45.070
analytics framework that we talked
about earlier in the course.

13
00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.940
Once you gather the data and
perform your analysis,

14
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.100
you need to be able to present that data
in a way that make sense to your end user.

15
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.560
In other words,
you have to visualize the data.

16
00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.219
Let's start with a basic
principle of data visualization.

17
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.937
Take a look at the table on the screen,
how many numbers are greater than one?

18
00:01:04.937 --> 00:01:05.750
Do you have it?

19
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.074
Now tell me how many numbers
are greater than one.

20
00:01:09.074 --> 00:01:13.660
Visualization doesn't have to be complex.

21
00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.480
In fact, visualization is all about
making complex insights simple.

22
00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.397
Simply highlighting the numbers
greater than one helped you solve

23
00:01:21.397 --> 00:01:22.382
the problem quickly.

24
00:01:22.382 --> 00:01:25.229
And that's data
visualization in a nutshell,

25
00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.940
the presentation of data in a pictorial or
graphical format.

26
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.490
We illustrate data with graphics and
communicate information clearly and

27
00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.120
effectively to users.

28
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.590
It's nothing new.

29
00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.900
For centuries, people have depended on
visual representations such as charts and

30
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.550
maps to understand information
more easily and quickly.

31
00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.780
As more and
more data is collected and analyzed,

32
00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.600
decision makers at all levels of the
organization welcome data visualization

33
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.430
software that enables them to see
analytical results presented visually.

34
00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.040
It helps them to find relevance
among millions of variables,

35
00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.500
communicate concepts and hypothesis to
others, and even predict the future.

36
00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:12.240
Visualization is important because the
brain processes visual information faster.

37
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.680
Users can spot patterns or trends which
are not obvious in a flat structure.

38
00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.999
Information can be
interpreted by any audience.

39
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.710
Decision making is faster and cheaper.

40
00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.980
Simply put, data visualization is just
a technique that helps everyone see and

41
00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.410
understand the analysis that is going on.

42
00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:31.270
For example,

43
00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.030
let's say you want look through customer
behaviors based on their location.

44
00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.900
You would have to go through tables and

45
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.652
tables of customer segments to identify
different behaviors by zip codes.

46
00:02:40.652 --> 00:02:45.500
It would take a lot of time to sort
through all that analysis and data.

47
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.270
If you plot that data on a map and
pinpoint stores or

48
00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.400
locations where specific customer
behaviors are occurring, you can use this

49
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.260
to develop strategies that attract
specific customers to specific locations.

50
00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.280
You can now take that map into a meeting
with your client and show him or

51
00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.590
her where all their stores are overlaid
with the data on their customers.

52
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.220
And you're able to tell a story that
will allow your client to adjust their

53
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.090
business strategy.

54
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:12.200
We're seeing that data and

55
00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.300
analytics today is underpinning
every kind of business challenge.

56
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.840
Being able to visualize data allows
you to present an analysis so

57
00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.170
that anyone can understand
what the information means.

58
00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:28.108
In the next couple of videos you'll
get to see some examples of how we

59
00:03:28.108 --> 00:03:32.786
use data visualization tools to
solve real business problems.
