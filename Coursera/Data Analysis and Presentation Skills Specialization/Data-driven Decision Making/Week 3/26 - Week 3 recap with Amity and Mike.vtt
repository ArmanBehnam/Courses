2
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:12.430
Welcome back.

3
00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.670
You've just finished week three,
nice job sticking with it.

4
00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.030
This week was more intense and
really went into more details

5
00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:22.170
on the different types of data and
analytic techniques and

6
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.890
some of the tools that are used
to analyze and visualize data.

7
00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.250
>> You started off the week
hearing Laurie talk about and

8
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.280
share examples of the different types of
analysis techniques that we use to help

9
00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.530
solve problems for our client.

10
00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.820
You had the opportunity to
download the interactive PDF

11
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.500
that gives an overview of each technique.

12
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.290
Keep this and
reference it whenever you need it.

13
00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.160
Being able to distinguish
between these techniques and

14
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.910
knowing what techniques can help
you answer your data questions

15
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.800
will help you distinguish
yourself from your peers.

16
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.240
You also heard Laurie, Eddie, Amy, and

17
00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.300
Rammy talk about quite a few different
tools that we use here at PWC.

18
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.790
There are so many different tools out
there that can help you perform different

19
00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.290
tasks and
solve different types of problems.

20
00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.820
Mike, as our Chief People Officer,
how can a person know all of these tools?

21
00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.310
>> Great question, Amity.

22
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.970
At PWC we don't expect you to
come in knowing every tool, but

23
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.360
having the base data and analytic skills,
and knowing what tools exist and

24
00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.010
what they can do, can set you apart.

25
00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.590
That's why we're focused on giving you
a high level overview of some of the tools

26
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.730
used today for data and analytics.

27
00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.620
We know technology and tools are
constantly evolving, but knowing one or

28
00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.710
two tools very well will help you to
be able to learn additional data and

29
00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.230
analytics tools in the future.

30
00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.000
That's one reason why courses two and

31
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.510
three cover commonly
used tools like Excel.

32
00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.790
It doesn't matter what role you have in
business, it's likely you're going to need

33
00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.440
to work with data and
perform analyses, extract insights.

34
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:55.790
>> Absolutely.

35
00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.750
You'll find most companies use these
tools all over the world to capture and

36
00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.710
analyze all kinds of data.

37
00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.790
>> Next week, you're going to take
everything you've learned in this course

38
00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.130
and apply it in a simulation and
in the course project.

39
00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.205
We'll share more details
when we kick off next week.
