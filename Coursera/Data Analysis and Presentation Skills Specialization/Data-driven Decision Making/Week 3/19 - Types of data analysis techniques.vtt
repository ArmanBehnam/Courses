2
00:00:11.121 --> 00:00:12.003
Welcome back.

3
00:00:12.003 --> 00:00:16.234
In this video we're going to look at
the different types of analyses you can

4
00:00:16.234 --> 00:00:20.332
perform once you have identified
the business problem or opportunity,

5
00:00:20.332 --> 00:00:23.440
developed a hypothesis and
collected relevant data.

6
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.278
As processing capacity continues
to increase, it has opened

7
00:00:27.278 --> 00:00:32.200
the door to a broad range of advanced
algorithms and modeling techniques.

8
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.520
That organizations can use to
produce valuable insights from data.

9
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.090
We will discuss a series of
analytical techniques and

10
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.560
how they are used in the real world.

11
00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.260
In the course materials, you have access
to a quick reference sheet that lists out

12
00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.360
all techniques for easy future reference.

13
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:49.920
>> Thanks Dan.

14
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.540
I'm Lorie Wijntjes,
managing director in our data and

15
00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.170
analytics practice with almost 30
years experience as a statistician.

16
00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.850
At PWC, I have worked on a wide variety
of business problems involving predictive

17
00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.878
analytics, data management,
statistical sampling, and survey design.

18
00:01:06.878 --> 00:01:10.920
Some fairly straightforward, and
many that have been complex,

19
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.300
across a wide range of business problems
in industries including healthcare,

20
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.680
financial services, and
retail and consumer.

21
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.460
In this video I will give you a high
level overview of the different types of

22
00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.760
analysis that you can perform on data.

23
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.590
As part of the course you will
find supplemental reading

24
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.280
that covers each of these analysis
types and how they are used.

25
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.140
Now, it's important to keep in mind that
the analysis you choose to perform will

26
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.070
depend on a couple of things.

27
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.950
First, the problem you
are trying to solve, and second,

28
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.980
the data you can use
to solve that problem.

29
00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.659
I'm going to start by talking
about cluster analysis.

30
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.250
Cluster analysis is when you
group a set of objects in a way

31
00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.180
that objects in the same group or

32
00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.920
cluster are more similar to one another
than those in the other clusters.

33
00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.340
Cluster analysis is often
used in market research

34
00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.920
when working with data from
focus groups and surveys.

35
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.000
A cluster analysis can be used to
segment a population of consumers

36
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.280
into market groups to better understand
the relationships between different

37
00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.320
groups of consumers.

38
00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:20.540
This analysis can help answer questions
such as, who are my target customers?

39
00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.510
How are they differentiated on behavioral,
psychographic and

40
00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.170
demographic characteristics?

41
00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.490
Are there groups that have similar
attributes so that products,

42
00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:35.780
services, price offerings,
can be used to customize segments?

43
00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.040
Now, let's move on to
decision tree analysis.

44
00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.740
A decision support tool that uses
a tree-like graph of decisions and

45
00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.720
their possible consequences.

46
00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.140
Including chance event outcomes,
resource cost, and utility.

47
00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.370
Decision tree analysis is often used
to assist healthcare practitioners

48
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.140
considering varying treatments along
with each one's associated costs and

49
00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.080
probability of a successful outcome.

50
00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.783
For example, healthcare providers can
use this analysis to assess options and

51
00:03:04.783 --> 00:03:09.208
deliver more cost effective treatments
that minimize the risk of hospital

52
00:03:09.208 --> 00:03:10.765
readmission.

53
00:03:10.765 --> 00:03:13.025
To analyze large numbers of dependent and

54
00:03:13.025 --> 00:03:16.655
independent variables,
we might use factor analysis.

55
00:03:16.655 --> 00:03:19.065
This type of analysis can help detect

56
00:03:19.065 --> 00:03:24.070
what aspects of the independent variables
are related to the dependent variables.

57
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.080
When we receive the data,
sets that are fairly wide,

58
00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.580
meaning that they had more variables
in observations or records.

59
00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.260
We need a way to identify
the core set of variables or

60
00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.920
drivers that will help to
gain meaningful insight.

61
00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.430
Factor analysis can help identify that
reduced subset of variables, meaning

62
00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.220
some of those variables represent similar
relationships as those not included, but

63
00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.720
perhaps in a stronger way.

64
00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.010
Machine learning is a type of artificial
intelligence that provides computers with

65
00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.442
the ability to learn without being
explicitly programmed to do so.

66
00:03:57.442 --> 00:04:00.060
For forward-thinking retailers,
the possibilities for

67
00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.660
advanced machine learning are limitless.

68
00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.160
Take for
example a company trying to predict

69
00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.090
what customers will be buying next spring.

70
00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.680
Machine learning algorithms can
determine availability of materials

71
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.750
from outside vendors, incorporate
various supply chain scenarios.

72
00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.460
And recommend the quantity, price,
shelf placement, and marketing

73
00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:25.010
channel that would best reach the target
consumer in a particular geographic area.

74
00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.530
These algorithms can also be used to
optimize sales for an individual store.

75
00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.860
Regression analysis is a statistical
process for estimating relationships

76
00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.130
between a dependent variable and
one or more independent variables.

77
00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:43.100
Variables are the pieces of information.

78
00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.413
This type of analysis helps you
understand how the value of

79
00:04:46.413 --> 00:04:51.023
a dependent variable changes when any
one of the independent variables change.

80
00:04:51.023 --> 00:04:56.588
For example, a large insurance company
wants to identify the characteristics

81
00:04:56.588 --> 00:05:01.440
including age group, income,
gender, educational level, etc.

82
00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.940
Of customers that tend to make
the most automobile claims.

83
00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.030
This type of analysis can
be used to assess risk, and

84
00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:13.210
also assist with determining pricing for
various automobile insurance products.

85
00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:16.540
Multivariate analysis
is the observation and

86
00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:21.040
analysis of more than one statistical
outcome variable at a time.

87
00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:26.020
This often includes as a first step
correlation analysis, which can help you

88
00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.620
understand and visualize relationships
between pairs of variables.

89
00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.770
Multivariate regression is a technique
that estimates a single regression model

90
00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.080
with more than one outcome variable.

91
00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.540
When there is more than one predictor
variable in a multivariate regression

92
00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:44.900
model, the model is a multivariate
multiple regression.

93
00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:49.577
To understand the relationships of outcome
effectiveness of a particular medical

94
00:05:49.577 --> 00:05:53.531
treatment, one may also need to
understand confounding variables.

95
00:05:53.531 --> 00:05:59.116
Such as age, weight, gender, or other
medications the patient may be receiving.

96
00:05:59.116 --> 00:06:02.233
There may be multiple ways
to assess outcome and thus,

97
00:06:02.233 --> 00:06:06.380
more than one dependent variable and
multiple independent variables.

98
00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:12.870
Segmentation analysis divides a broad
category into subsets that have or

99
00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:16.930
are perceived to have common features,
needs, interests, or priorities.

100
00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:22.890
Often, segmentation analysis is used to
better understand customer needs by diving

101
00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:27.263
a large number of individuals into
smaller groups based on a logical scheme.

102
00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:32.140
Segmentation provides a convenient
mechanism around which to

103
00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:36.680
develop products, construct programs,
and execute marketing tactics.

104
00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.330
Imagine that a bank was developing
a strategy to become a leader

105
00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:43.060
in mobile payments and mobile banking.

106
00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:49.327
Traditionally, product penetration was
driven by the bank's relationship managers

107
00:06:49.327 --> 00:06:50.415
and its branches.

108
00:06:50.415 --> 00:06:55.270
Segmentation analysis could help the bank
gain market share by identifying key

109
00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:59.183
customer segments and
developing product recommendations for

110
00:06:59.183 --> 00:07:02.234
those that are more likely
to use mobile banking.

111
00:07:02.234 --> 00:07:05.339
Sentiment analysis is
a process of identifying and

112
00:07:05.339 --> 00:07:10.610
categorizing opinions expressed in a piece
of text to determine whether the writer's

113
00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:15.030
attitude towards a topic or
issue is positive, negative, or neutral.

114
00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:21.190
This analysis often relies on
natural language processing or NLP.

115
00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:24.020
Which is use to perform the data
mining of the Internet.

116
00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:27.770
These allows companies
to better understand

117
00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:31.470
what their consumers are saying
about their product offerings and

118
00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:34.880
to adjust strategies where feasible
to improve customer sentiment.

119
00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:39.530
Categorization of the information
scraped from the Internet

120
00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:41.480
can then be use to develop models.

121
00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:45.120
Sometimes it's hard to
determine if a system or

122
00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:48.840
a process will react to a change
the way we think it will.

123
00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:54.060
One way to test changes to a system or
process is by performing a simulation.

124
00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:59.620
A simulation is the imitation of
the operation of a real world process or

125
00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:01.400
system over time.

126
00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:04.760
It requires a model that represents
the key characteristics or

127
00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:07.610
behaviors of a selective system or
process.

128
00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:10.610
Think about hospital admissions.

129
00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:13.750
For a hospital wanting to figure
out how to reduce wait time,

130
00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:17.190
analytic tools could help
simulate the admission process.

131
00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:20.700
Allowing the hospital to change
the values of certain variables and

132
00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:24.410
see the impact on a patient's wait time.

133
00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:28.330
The last type of analysis we want
to discuss is time series analysis.

134
00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:34.525
Time series analysis can be used to design
a methodology to identify the factors

135
00:08:34.525 --> 00:08:39.510
affecting airline passenger demand on
routes by leveraging macroeconomic,

136
00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:45.030
demographic, and other external data,
at a local, state, and national level.

137
00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:49.350
Such models can be developed to produce
a route level forecast of total demand for

138
00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:50.400
air travel.

139
00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:54.210
Helping to optimize route and capacity
planning and identify new routes for

140
00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:55.670
market entry.

141
00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:58.000
Time series analysis comprises methods for

142
00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.550
analyzing data that are collected over
time to extract meaningful statistics.

143
00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:06.700
Stock prices, sales volumes,
interest rates, and

144
00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:09.850
quality measurements
are all typical examples.

145
00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:13.970
Because of this sequential nature of
the data, special statistical techniques

146
00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:17.860
accounting for the dynamic
nature of the data are required.

147
00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:21.090
Now, let's answer one last assessment
question for this segment.

148
00:09:22.255 --> 00:09:25.280
>> Lori covered some great
material in this session.

149
00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:28.470
And as you can see there are many
different analytical techniques that can

150
00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:31.540
be used to address a problem or
opportunity.

151
00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:33.370
As I mentioned at
the beginning of this video,

152
00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:37.940
there is a quick reference guide available
as part of this week's materials.

153
00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:40.520
Use the guide to review
the different analytic techniques.

154
00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:45.372
In the upcoming videos you're going
to hear from some of PWC's subject

155
00:09:45.372 --> 00:09:49.881
matter specialists on tools used for data
and analytics and for visualizing data.

156
00:09:49.881 --> 00:09:55.814
