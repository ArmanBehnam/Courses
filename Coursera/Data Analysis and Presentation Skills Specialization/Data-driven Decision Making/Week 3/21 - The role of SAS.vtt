00:00:12.102 --> 00:00:16.568
In this video we're going to look at
the role of SAS in data and analytics.

3
00:00:16.568 --> 00:00:20.537
SAS stands for Statistical Analysis
System, a licensed software system for

4
00:00:20.537 --> 00:00:22.990
data analysis, graphs, and report writing.

5
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.390
SAS comprises a group of computer programs
that work together to store data values

6
00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.300
and retrieve them,
modify data, compute simple and

7
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.630
complex statistical analysis,
and create reports.

8
00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.328
Commercial and public organizations
use SAS to perform data analysis.

9
00:00:43.328 --> 00:00:48.773
Non-technical users can interact with
SASâ€™s point-and-click user interface.

10
00:00:48.773 --> 00:00:53.540
There are also more advanced programming
options, called SAS language, that allow

11
00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.680
you to perform more complex data
management and advanced analysis on data.

12
00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.200
We have used SAS to aggregate large and
varied data sets,

13
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:07.230
merging multiple datasets on key variables
to construct longitudinal patient and

14
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:08.360
customer histories.

15
00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.110
These data sets may include third party
external data that has been purchased or

16
00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.020
subscribed, publicly available data,
and of course, our client's data.

17
00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.370
SAS allows us to maintain logs and
lists of the programs run and

18
00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.800
the outcome of each merger
step where data were combined

19
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.350
to provide record of the number of
observations processed to our clients and

20
00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.750
for review by third parties,
such as regulatory agencies.

21
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.496
It also allows us the capability to make
changes to existing SAS programs for

22
00:01:42.496 --> 00:01:44.575
re-use and scalability.

23
00:01:44.575 --> 00:01:49.763
You now have a high level understanding
of how SAS is used in data and analytics.
