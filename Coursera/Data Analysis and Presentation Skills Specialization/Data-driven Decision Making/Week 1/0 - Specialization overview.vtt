2
00:00:11.631 --> 00:00:17.690
Currently, the amount of data in the
digital universe doubles every two years.

3
00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.010
Think about how much data you have
at your fingertips right now,

4
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.885
including the 500 million tweets
people send every single day,

5
00:00:27.885 --> 00:00:33.130
the 100 hours of video uploaded
to YouTube every minute.

6
00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:38.320
The percentage of mobile things
in the Internet of things will be

7
00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:44.560
over 75% by 2020,
while new sources of data like sensors,

8
00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:49.380
actuators, and intelligent
devices will continually emerge.

9
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:54.301
Data and analytic skills enable
organizations to use all of these types

10
00:00:54.301 --> 00:00:57.580
of data to make informed decisions.

11
00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:03.410
Hello, I'm Mike Fenlon, and I serve
as the global talent leader for PwC.

12
00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:04.690
A majority of business and

13
00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.870
technology executives agree that one
of the major challenges we all face

14
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:14.970
is turning such an overwhelming
amount of data into real insight.

15
00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.280
And a big reason for this is the skills
gap between what businesses need and

16
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.270
what job seekers and those who want
to advance their careers possess.

17
00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.646
As the role of data in making
decisions in business grows,

18
00:01:28.646 --> 00:01:33.180
new jobs are being created that
demand new sets of skills.

19
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.970
And the skills that we all took for

20
00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.640
granted as basic for
career advancement are changing.

21
00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.350
Organizations around the world need
people to be able to use data and

22
00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.440
apply analytics, and not just for
data and analytics positions.

23
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.560
These are becoming key skills for many,

24
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.890
and perhaps all types of jobs and
positions.

25
00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.837
I want to give you a little
bit of background on why this

26
00:01:58.837 --> 00:02:01.398
specialization is so important.

27
00:02:01.398 --> 00:02:06.065
At PwC,
data is at the heart of everything we do.

28
00:02:06.065 --> 00:02:10.626
The real power of data lies in
creating actionable insights and

29
00:02:10.626 --> 00:02:14.585
in how we apply these insights
to the strategic choices

30
00:02:14.585 --> 00:02:18.490
we make in organizations,
as well as how we operate.

31
00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:23.650
At PwC, our purpose is to build trust in
society and solve important problems,

32
00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.100
especially the challenges that arise
as our world undergoes rapid and

33
00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.830
dramatic change.

34
00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.961
And we've identified five megatrends that
are impacting the global marketplace and

35
00:02:34.961 --> 00:02:37.480
creating new challenges and opportunities.

36
00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:44.600
One is urbanization as we face a huge
shift of people moving from rural and

37
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.230
suburban locations into
cities around the world.

38
00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.340
Another is the accelerating
rate of population growth.

39
00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.450
Then there's climate change and
the skyrocketing demand for

40
00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.270
more natural resources.

41
00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.894
For example, over the next 30 years,
we'll need 50% more energy,

42
00:03:01.894 --> 00:03:04.591
40% more water, and 35% more food.

43
00:03:04.591 --> 00:03:09.758
There are global shifts in economic and
political power.

44
00:03:09.758 --> 00:03:14.779
And finally, of course, technology is
exploding, and the digital data each

45
00:03:14.779 --> 00:03:20.110
of us has at our fingertips is changing
every business and organization.

46
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.500
More powerful sources of data and
analytic tools give us the ability to

47
00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.480
create the insights that will allow
us to solve the new challenges and

48
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.070
opportunities we will face today and
tomorrow.

49
00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.700
That's why organizations need people with
the right skills to take the overwhelming

50
00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:45.130
amount of data, analyze it, visualize it,
and use it to generate new insights.

51
00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:50.400
Organizations have collected and
analyzed data for decades.

52
00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.980
But the role of data and analytics and the
skills required to make the most of them

53
00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.200
have become progressively more important.

54
00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.880
We've seen new roles being created in
many different types of organizations,

55
00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.140
such as data scientist and
chief data officer positions.

56
00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.950
But it's not just new roles that
require data and analytics skills.

57
00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:18.150
As traditional data and
analytics roles evolve, the skills and

58
00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.799
experience needed to fill
them are evolving quickly.

59
00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.335
And 57% of data and analytics
recruiters say it is difficult to

60
00:04:26.335 --> 00:04:28.940
find people with
the necessary qualifications.

61
00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:35.630
This course will provide an introduction
to basic skills in data analysis,

62
00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.310
how to visualize and
communicate what data tells us, and

63
00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:43.320
how to crystallize key insights
with simplicity and clarity.

64
00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.060
These skills are relevant for
all of us and

65
00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.800
can serve as an important differentiator
at any stage of your career.

66
00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.370
While we're focused on building some
important technical skills in this course,

67
00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:00.689
it's also important to adopt a holistic
mindset in how you develop yourself.

68
00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.910
In fact, the ability to translate data
into insight and communicate effectively

69
00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:11.790
and influence others depends on
a broader set of capabilities, as well.

70
00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:17.080
For example, at PwC our people
use the PwC Professional,

71
00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.510
our global career progression framework
that, in addition to technical skills like

72
00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:26.960
data analysis, includes broader
business acumen, relationship skills,

73
00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:32.380
global acumen, and the skills required
to work across cultures and differences,

74
00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:37.030
whole leadership, designed to develop
skills needed to lead at all levels.

75
00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:41.850
Now, this broad base will equip you
to not only solve challenges, but

76
00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:45.370
also to frame issues in
a broader context so

77
00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:50.390
you can ask the right questions, the ones
that lead to root causes and solutions.

78
00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:55.710
In this specialization,
you'll learn from our PwC professionals

79
00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:59.540
about how to use data and
analytics to solve important problems.

80
00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:06.200
As we close, I'm going to ask you
to think about one word, potential.

81
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:09.000
Let it sink in.

82
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.230
It's a powerful word.

83
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:15.510
Have you ever known someone who has
not fulfilled his or her potential?

84
00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:18.450
As Erik Brynjolfsson and

85
00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:23.680
Andrew McAfee put in their book The Second
Machine Age, acquiring an education

86
00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:28.350
is the best way to not be left
behind as technology races ahead.

87
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:33.750
By taking responsibility for your own
development, by pushing yourself and

88
00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:39.410
demonstrating the perseverance to complete
this course and advance your development,

89
00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:45.050
you're positioning yourself to not only
be relevant in a rapidly changing world,

90
00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:49.110
but to be on the path to fulfilling
your potential in your career.

91
00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:54.820
So I urge you to take responsibility for
advancing your own development and

92
00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:59.430
start to build a foundation of skills
that will help enable you to fulfill your

93
00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:01.150
own potential.

94
00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:06.247
What problems will data and
analytic skills help

95
00:07:06.247 --> 00:07:10.858
you solve while advancing your own career?

96
00:07:10.858 --> 00:07:14.099
