2
00:00:11.391 --> 00:00:12.502
Welcome back.

3
00:00:12.502 --> 00:00:16.632
In this video, you'll have an opportunity
to meet some of our PWC Professionals,

4
00:00:16.632 --> 00:00:18.520
who'll share with you how the data and

5
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.530
analytics framework is applied
in their area of expertise.

6
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.470
>> Hello, I'm John Gotts.

7
00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.160
I help clients solve complex tax
challenges by helping to deliver quality

8
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.030
data to the right people and enable them
with effective processes and technology.

9
00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.610
After changing my career focus a few years
ago, I have a significant focus on data

10
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.820
and analytics to improve
how tax professionals work.

11
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.429
This is fundamental in tax.

12
00:00:43.429 --> 00:00:47.158
We must apply the law to the specific
circumstances, and use data for

13
00:00:47.158 --> 00:00:51.720
a tax payer to determine their
obligation to pay tax under the law.

14
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.620
At PWC we think of data as the life
blood of tax professionals.

15
00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.370
Without access to quality data,
our ability to provide advice and

16
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.670
guide the business in making
decisions is greatly diminished.

17
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.520
For several years, many tax professionals
have worked with data in whatever format

18
00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.060
was provided to them.

19
00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.630
This means highly skilled
tax professionals

20
00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.460
must spend time collecting and manually
manipulating information for their use.

21
00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.160
Changes to the source data often require
a rework of these manual processes.

22
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.300
Not a great use of time for
these subject matter experts.

23
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.630
These challenges play out both
within PWC and at our clients.

24
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.950
The solutions we bring to clients focused
on people, process, data and technology.

25
00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.550
Our solutions usually touch
on all four areas and

26
00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.340
almost definitely will touch on data.

27
00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.350
Helping to deliver quality
information to tax professionals

28
00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.090
when they need it is a key
element of our work.

29
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.000
There are many ways we approach these
challenges, including transforming the raw

30
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.730
data, improving the way in which
non-standard data is collected and

31
00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:56.900
using analytics to help visualize or
bring a different perspective to the data.

32
00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.740
Tax is a challenging and technical area of
study which traditionally has not how it's

33
00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.445
been well understood
throughout organizations.

34
00:02:03.445 --> 00:02:06.270
Analytics is helping to
bring tax to the forefront

35
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.240
since a well crafted analytics report
can communicate in complex content and

36
00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.350
improve the ability of
the business to make decisions.

37
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.320
Taxes are deadline driven environment.

38
00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.000
So, having a clear understanding of
the organization's obligations and

39
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.630
tracking the status of
those is imperative.

40
00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.690
For many organizations, this is
a manual and time consuming process.

41
00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.480
We've helped many organizations to
leverage technology to reduce the effort

42
00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.180
and risk associated with these activities.

43
00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.250
In addition, the technology allows us to
standardize the collection of data across

44
00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.230
the globe in real time.

45
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.060
An immediate benefit is that we can
generate analytics on data and produce

46
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.030
reports that allow people to visualize
the information in a different way.

47
00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.170
For example, we use a world map to
display the status of tax filings in each

48
00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.070
jurisdiction around the world.

49
00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.450
This can bring life to information which
historically has been viewed in a two

50
00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.720
dimensional spreadsheet and
is usually several days out of date.

51
00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.750
Transparency and information reporting
are high in the agenda of tax authorities

52
00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.020
around the world.

53
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.970
This requires tax professionals to produce
reports for new and changing requirements.

54
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.170
This is extremely challenging
using traditional approaches.

55
00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.360
We have helped several organizations
to rethink the approach to collecting

56
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.980
information for these reports and
reduce the effort and risk in the process.

57
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.760
Having collected the information we
also build analytics to give them deeper

58
00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.430
insight into the information so

59
00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.810
that they can consider how
the information may be perceived.

60
00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.370
This allows them to proactively plan and
provide better insight and

61
00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.240
support to the business.

62
00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.280
There are diverse skill sets needed to
solve problems using data and analytics.

63
00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.390
For me, most importantly is communication.

64
00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.210
We often need to address business,
finance, technology, and

65
00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:49.320
tax technical considerations
to solve these problems.

66
00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.270
It's rare that one person has
the professional experiences to

67
00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:53.900
solve the problem alone.

68
00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.830
As a result, communicating within a team
of diverse individuals is critical.

69
00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.320
>> Hello, I'm Vikas Agarwal.

70
00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:05.940
I started my career focused on using data
analytics to help clients solve problems.

71
00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.550
This meant thinking about better ways
to collect data, analyze it, and

72
00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.920
present it in meaningful ways.

73
00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.270
Solving problems using an analytical
approach is a differentiator for

74
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:18.090
professionals today.

75
00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.970
There's such demand for people who
can understand business problems, and

76
00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.810
then apply analytics.

77
00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.120
The ability to use machines and
computers to help us process information

78
00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.460
has rapidly increased
in the last 10 years.

79
00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.860
Every time we look at a problem today we
have to think about how we can collect

80
00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.780
more information,
how we can process it and visualize it so

81
00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.350
we can get a better answer in the end.

82
00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.680
I can't think of a use case with
our clients that can't be enhanced.

83
00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.370
By using more analytical techniques
that are available today.

84
00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.410
Personally I work in financial crime.

85
00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:54.360
And I helped our client used data to
prevent money laundering, fraud, and

86
00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.610
identify bad actors externally and
internally.

87
00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.700
We used huge amounts of data,
customer data, transactional information

88
00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:05.280
To find needles in the haystack
that lead to the identification

89
00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.580
of suicidal issues like human trafficking,
narcotics dealing, and tax evasion.

90
00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.960
Today we're using web crawling and
machine learning to identify events and

91
00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.479
potential threats to our society
using more data than ever before.

92
00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.280
As the need for more analytics increases,
we need to raise the IQ of

93
00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.790
every professional to be able to
conduct sophisticated analytics and

94
00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:28.730
breakdown traditional skills of barriers.

95
00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:34.560
>> In this video you heard how we apply
data and analytics to solve problems.

96
00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.000
You also heard about the key
skills needed to do so.

97
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.859
You can learn more about data and
analytics careers and
