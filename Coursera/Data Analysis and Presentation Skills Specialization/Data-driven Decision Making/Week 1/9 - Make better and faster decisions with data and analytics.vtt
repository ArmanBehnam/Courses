00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:15.677
Today I'm joined by Paul Blaze,
PWC's Global and US Data and

3
00:00:15.677 --> 00:00:17.717
Analytics Consulting Leader.

4
00:00:17.717 --> 00:00:21.064
We'll hear from three business
leaders who joined the PWC's round

5
00:00:21.064 --> 00:00:22.952
table who joined on fall of 2015.

6
00:00:22.952 --> 00:00:26.254
As we discuss how organizations
like theirs can make better and

7
00:00:26.254 --> 00:00:28.567
faster decisions with data and analytics.

9
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:52.216
Even in a world where we're able to
make increasingly more sophisticated and

10
00:00:52.216 --> 00:00:56.860
faster decisions, we're not
suggesting it's just about the data.

11
00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.452
There is certainly a role for gut
instinct, for experience, for intuition.

12
00:01:01.452 --> 00:01:04.868
But how do you really kind of combine
that in the best possible way?

13
00:01:04.868 --> 00:01:09.776
>> When you think about all the databases,
the systems being design in your

14
00:01:09.776 --> 00:01:13.411
organizations, how they
interface with the users.

15
00:01:13.411 --> 00:01:16.330
Is there a better way
to combine the art and

16
00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.700
science of decision making with
all the tools we have available?

17
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.245
That will help people become better users.

19
00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.710
>> But I like to actually think
of it as a translator skill.

20
00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.570
You need someone to ride along as
the business is exploring the business

21
00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.290
problem and you have this highly technical
person who understands capabilities,

22
00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.510
but they don't understand
each other's worlds, right?

23
00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:55.385
And if you have someone who does on your
team, utilize them much like you would use

24
00:01:55.385 --> 00:02:00.125
a data scientist as a shared service,
and they actually become a translator.

25
00:02:00.125 --> 00:02:06.225
The clientine, based on the problem,
brings together the technical person,

26
00:02:06.225 --> 00:02:12.611
with the client engagement manager, to
make sure that two things happen, right?

27
00:02:12.611 --> 00:02:18.068
The work that has been done
appropriately reflects the question

28
00:02:18.068 --> 00:02:23.221
that the executive is asking and
then it's presented back in

29
00:02:23.221 --> 00:02:28.703
the way that work's for you not for
the analyst who did the work.

30
00:02:28.703 --> 00:02:33.712
>> The biggest data successes I have seen
are when somebody takes idea from one

31
00:02:33.712 --> 00:02:36.660
domain combine's it with
a data asset they have and

32
00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.139
just come's up with a brilliant
execution in the news base.

33
00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.770
And those are the kinds of things
you only can see if you understand

34
00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.684
the technology and its capabilities,

35
00:02:46.684 --> 00:02:50.512
you understand your data and what it can
actually tell you about the world, and

36
00:02:50.512 --> 00:02:53.769
you are thinking about the future
of business all at the same time.

38
00:03:03.805 --> 00:03:10.001
>> We all, in our respective industries
we're used to saying, what is happening?

39
00:03:10.001 --> 00:03:13.009
So it's just trend looking in the rear
view mirror and then we started asking,

40
00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.910
why did that happen?

41
00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:14.670
Right?

42
00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.176
Which is root cause analysis.

43
00:03:16.176 --> 00:03:19.488
And then we started saying can I predict
what's going to happen next, right,

44
00:03:19.488 --> 00:03:20.454
that's predictive.

45
00:03:20.454 --> 00:03:24.929
And I think that we're all working through
those three layers pretty rapidly as

46
00:03:24.929 --> 00:03:26.070
industries.

47
00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:31.279
But beyond that then it's what next
question should I be asking and

48
00:03:31.279 --> 00:03:36.210
how can I use the data to ask
the next generation of questions and

49
00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:41.534
that exploration and innovation has
to come with a into what value.

51
00:03:55.576 --> 00:03:58.826
You just heard PWC professionals and
business leaders tell us how they

52
00:03:58.826 --> 00:04:01.650
made better and
faster decisions using data and analytics.

53
00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.020
What stood out to you in this video?

54
00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:10.566
Take sometime to think about it and then
join other learners on a discussion board.

55
00:04:10.566 --> 00:04:14.362
In the next video, we'll look at
how technology advancements and

56
00:04:14.362 --> 00:04:17.766
data trends are changing
the ways organizations use data.
