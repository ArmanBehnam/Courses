00:00:11.345 --> 00:00:12.517
Welcome back.

3
00:00:12.517 --> 00:00:15.210
I am Anand Rao and
I lead a team of data scientists.

4
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.280
We're constantly looking for
innovative techniques,

5
00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.865
tools and technologies to
apply to our client problems.

6
00:00:21.865 --> 00:00:24.700
We work closely with academic
institutions, start-up companies and

7
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.180
establish clients to bring
innovative solutions.

8
00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.780
In this video, we're going to look
at the data and analytics framework.

9
00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.700
I'm going to talk about
the compliments of the framework and

10
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.680
explain why it's important to follow a
framework when solving a business problem.

11
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.230
Let me give you an example.

12
00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.680
A global insurance company came to
us with the desire to incorporate

13
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.150
advanced data and
analytics within their organization.

14
00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.430
They're a number of business
objectives that they wanted to achieve,

15
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.520
including improving retention and
cross selling in one country and

16
00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.470
increasing acquisition in another country.

17
00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.570
They wanted to build
an analytics organization,

18
00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.030
while at the same time ensuring
that they solve a business problem.

19
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.120
We went through our data and

20
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.430
analytics framework to first determine
the outcomes in each country.

21
00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.310
For example, as we said, greater
cross-product holding in one country.

22
00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.620
Then we listed all the actions or

23
00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.660
decisions they can take
to effect that outcome.

24
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:29.360
For example, who to target, when,
why and through which channel.

25
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.560
That led us to investigate how they
were making those decisions today and

26
00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.710
how they could be improved
with better insights.

27
00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.620
For example, insights around next
best product, channel preferences.

28
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:48.640
This led us to the techniques that are
required to generate those insights and

29
00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.520
the data required to
generate those insights.

30
00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.170
For example, characteristics of
existing customers with one,

31
00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.980
two or three products with the client.

32
00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.526
So why do we need data and
analytics framework?

33
00:02:02.526 --> 00:02:06.880
The short answer is a framework
allows you to move through

34
00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.950
data analysis in an organized way.

35
00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.930
It provides you with a process to
follow as you walk with your teams and

36
00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.830
clients to solve problems.

37
00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.040
The framework allows us to focus
on the business outcomes first and

38
00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.878
the actions and
decisions that enable the outcomes.

39
00:02:25.878 --> 00:02:30.660
It focuses our attention on what
generates value to our clients

40
00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.720
first before examining all
the data that we do have or

41
00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.390
data that we don't have
that needs to be procured.

42
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.920
In summary, the framework allows us to
structure of a discretions with the client

43
00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.760
and follow a path that leads to actionable
insights and business outcomes.

44
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.010
If you're not using a framework, there's a
good chance that different people will use

45
00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.940
different approaches to
solve the same problem.

46
00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.540
If you don't use the approach we outlined,
there is a tendency for

47
00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.190
people to start with the data.

48
00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.970
And then try to figure out all the cool
analytics that one can do and then try and

49
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.750
figure out how they can be applied.

50
00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.540
While this may be a fine exploratory
process for newcomers in the field.

51
00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.508
It is an approach that is fought
with dangers of overanalysis and

52
00:03:21.508 --> 00:03:23.644
a hammer looking for a nail to hit.

53
00:03:23.644 --> 00:03:33.644
