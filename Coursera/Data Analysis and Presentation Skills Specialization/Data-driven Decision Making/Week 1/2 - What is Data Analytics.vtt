00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.080
Welcome to the first video in

2
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.420
the data driven
decision making course.

3
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.075
We want to introduce
you to Dan DiFilippo.

4
00:00:18.075 --> 00:00:19.380
Dan is going to be one of

5
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.435
your main instructors
for this course.

6
00:00:21.435 --> 00:00:22.560
In this first video,

7
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.510
Dan will provide you
with an overview

8
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.925
of what data and analytics is.

9
00:00:26.925 --> 00:00:28.575
As you move through the course,

10
00:00:28.575 --> 00:00:30.690
you'll go into more
detail about many of

11
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.225
the topics introduced
in this video.

12
00:00:33.225 --> 00:00:35.100
We'll be back again at the end of

13
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.930
the week to talk about
what you've learned.

14
00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.570
Thanks Amity and Mike.

15
00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.760
I lead a global team that helps
clients use the data they

16
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.200
have and the data they

17
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.095
need to make better
and faster decisions.

18
00:00:48.095 --> 00:00:52.130
Rapid technology change means
how we deal with data is

19
00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.350
fundamentally
different today than

20
00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.390
it was just a few years ago.

21
00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.150
In this session, I'll
discuss what data and

22
00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.090
analytics is and
why it's important,

23
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.339
the impact it's
having on business,

24
00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:05.990
and how it can help organizations

25
00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.260
make better and faster decisions.

26
00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.190
First, what do we mean by data?

27
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.795
Webster's defines data as
a collection of facts,

28
00:01:14.795 --> 00:01:18.110
observations, or other
information related

29
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.840
to a particular
question or problem.

30
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.975
Data can be structured
or unstructured.

31
00:01:23.975 --> 00:01:27.200
Structured data is information
with a high degree of

32
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.210
organization that could be

33
00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.670
included in databases
or spreadsheets,

34
00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.440
and is easily searchable by

35
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.155
simple search engine algorithms.

36
00:01:36.155 --> 00:01:38.930
Think of how a multiple
choice question forces

37
00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.665
your answer into a
predefined category.

38
00:01:42.665 --> 00:01:44.720
Unstructured data is the

39
00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.600
opposite and is
usually text-heavy,

40
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.534
though it may contain video,

41
00:01:49.534 --> 00:01:52.840
data or numbers,
and facts as well.

42
00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.880
Think of an open
field text box that

43
00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.895
allows you to provide additional
comments on a survey.

44
00:01:58.895 --> 00:02:00.860
Adding to the complexity,

45
00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.110
data can also come
from a variety of

46
00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.610
internal and external
sources for organizations.

47
00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.570
The conversation gets really

48
00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.510
interesting when we look at
the wide variety of data

49
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.880
available to us today and the

50
00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.690
powerful analytics that can
be applied to that data.

51
00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.389
Analytics is the
science of examining

52
00:02:20.389 --> 00:02:22.010
raw data in order to

53
00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.605
draw conclusions about
the information.

54
00:02:24.605 --> 00:02:28.400
It's an exciting field and is
dramatically impacting how

55
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.509
organizations in many industries
are making decisions.

56
00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:35.450
The availability
of huge volumes of

57
00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.125
structured and
unstructured data sets,

58
00:02:38.125 --> 00:02:41.435
combined with advanced
computing capabilities,

59
00:02:41.435 --> 00:02:46.250
low-cost storage, and powerful
visualization technology,

60
00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.640
is enabling organizations
to gain insight once

61
00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.540
technologically impossible
or economically impractical.

62
00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:54.950
It is also enabling

63
00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.680
new entities to startup
and scale quickly,

64
00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.570
which can bring great benefit to

65
00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.460
the market and to society,

66
00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:02.810
but can also be very

67
00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.950
disruptive and challenge
the status quo.

68
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.510
Where's all this
data coming from?

69
00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.480
From market research
and social media to

70
00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.130
the network of physical objects

71
00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.110
we call the Internet of things.

72
00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.840
The world we live in
today is creating

73
00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.505
a constant and ever
increasing stream of data.

74
00:03:21.505 --> 00:03:24.710
For most organizations,
the data they can

75
00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:28.955
access is increasing at a
rate of 40 percent each year,

76
00:03:28.955 --> 00:03:31.160
which creates
significant challenges

77
00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.590
in the way data is
captured and secured,

78
00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.410
organized, analyzed,
and reported.

79
00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.305
Lets quickly touch on three ways

80
00:03:39.305 --> 00:03:42.620
that data and analytics is
impacting business today.

81
00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.700
First, data is enabling
new products and services,

82
00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.790
creating markets that
didn't previously exist,

83
00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.105
and bringing new capabilities
to existing markets.

84
00:03:53.105 --> 00:03:55.160
Second, it is disrupting

85
00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.160
existing markets with
innovative upstarts,

86
00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.920
unseating traditionally secure
businesses. Think of Uber.

87
00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.530
Third, data and analytics

88
00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.940
is driving increased efficiency.

89
00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.550
For example, retailers
have the ability

90
00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:13.810
to automate and optimize
their supply chain,

91
00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.295
tailoring offerings
for customers,

92
00:04:16.295 --> 00:04:17.780
making services such as

93
00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.580
Amazon same-day delivery in

94
00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:22.515
major US cities,
logistically possible.

95
00:04:22.515 --> 00:04:24.590
In short, data's providing

96
00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:25.970
organizations the ability to

97
00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.860
identify growth opportunities,

98
00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.115
drive innovation, operate
more efficiently,

99
00:04:31.115 --> 00:04:33.250
and manage risk in new ways.

100
00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.060
If data can do all that,

101
00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.520
organization simply
must use it to

102
00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.580
stay competitive. But how?

103
00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.010
Organizations have
always used data in

104
00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:46.055
some form to inform
their decisions.

105
00:04:46.055 --> 00:04:47.960
But the volume, variety,

106
00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.790
and velocity of data available

107
00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.700
today presents huge challenges.

108
00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.735
Traditional approaches
to data analysis,

109
00:04:55.735 --> 00:04:58.880
identify a problem or
business opportunity,

110
00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.910
collect data and
use spreadsheets or

111
00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:05.390
software to understand
it, no longer apply.

112
00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:08.060
The volume of information
today is simply too

113
00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:11.270
high and the time
frames way too short.

114
00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.184
Confronting these challenges
can lead to immense reward.

115
00:05:15.184 --> 00:05:18.260
Smart organizations are
taking advantage of data and

116
00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.845
analytics to gain a clearer
picture of their business.

117
00:05:21.845 --> 00:05:23.750
They are using new technologies

118
00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:25.620
such as data visualization,

119
00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.290
the presentation of data in

120
00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:29.960
a pictorial or
graphical format to

121
00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.175
help decision makers see
analytics presented visually,

122
00:05:34.175 --> 00:05:37.150
and more easily
identify new patterns.

123
00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:40.850
This insight is powerful
and can fundamentally

124
00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:44.695
change the speed and
sophistication of decision making.

125
00:05:44.695 --> 00:05:47.450
At PwC, we work with clients to

126
00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:50.660
effectively use data in every
part of their business.

127
00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:53.885
From customer acquisition,
talent retention,

128
00:05:53.885 --> 00:05:57.290
and market expansion
to reporting results,

129
00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:00.650
meeting compliance requirements
and managing risk.

130
00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:03.410
We'll talk more about
applying data and analytics

131
00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:05.945
in business settings as
part of this course.

132
00:06:05.945 --> 00:06:09.680
In future videos, we'll look
at some examples and talk to

133
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.805
PwC professionals to help
bring these concepts to life.

134
00:06:13.805 --> 00:06:16.340
Let's quickly recap
what we covered in

135
00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:19.085
this short introduction
to data and analytics.

136
00:06:19.085 --> 00:06:22.280
We talked about structured
and unstructured data and how

137
00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.290
the explosion of
data is leading to

138
00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:26.780
new business challenges
and opportunities.

139
00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:28.640
We talked about how
important it is for

140
00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:31.225
organizations to take
advantage of all that data.

141
00:06:31.225 --> 00:06:32.810
We spoke about how

142
00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:36.170
new technologies can help to
do that by aggregating and

143
00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:39.455
presenting data in meaningful
and impactful ways

144
00:06:39.455 --> 00:06:42.529
that can help companies
make better decisions.

145
00:06:42.529 --> 00:06:44.390
Thanks for watching, and I

146
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:47.190
hope you enjoy the
rest of the sessions.
