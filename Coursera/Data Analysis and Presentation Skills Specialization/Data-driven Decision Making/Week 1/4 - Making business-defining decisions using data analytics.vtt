00:00:11.087 --> 00:00:16.119
In today's environment highly data driven
organizations are making better and

3
00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:17.381
faster decisions.

4
00:00:17.381 --> 00:00:21.677
At PwC we believe data and analytics can
make a huge difference when it comes to

5
00:00:21.677 --> 00:00:26.530
the most significant decisions about the
strategic direction of an organization.

6
00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:30.120
Now, let's take a look at how data
helps organizations make decisions.

7
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.170
>> Businesses make thousands
of decisions a day.

8
00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.975
Most are routine,
many are underpinned by data.

9
00:00:38.975 --> 00:00:41.845
A growing number can be automated, but

10
00:00:41.845 --> 00:00:46.715
what happens when it comes to decisions
that go beyond day to day operations?

11
00:00:46.715 --> 00:00:50.919
Decisions that will shift the course
of a business, or even an industry, and

12
00:00:50.919 --> 00:00:52.416
shape the world we live in.

13
00:00:52.416 --> 00:00:54.467
[MUSIC]

14
00:00:54.467 --> 00:00:57.139
These are what we call big decisions.

15
00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.098
They set the direction for the business
and are both high value and high stakes.

16
00:01:03.098 --> 00:01:05.899
[MUSIC]

17
00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:10.300
Big decisions are made frequently and
revisited often.

18
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.370
They can be reactive, forced by
circumstances beyond our control.

19
00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.060
Executives tell us their decision
making lacks the sophistication and

20
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.060
speed they need for competitive advantage,
the sophistication to reach

21
00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.190
clarity on critical decisions,
creatively use new sources of data,

22
00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.380
use analytics to assess options and
estimate value.

23
00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.920
And the speed to opportunistically
make decisions, quickly source and

24
00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.780
experiment with new data, monitor results,
and adjust decision making.

25
00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.820
To think as expansively as
technology makes possible,

26
00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:54.130
we need to bring together our most
powerful assets, the art of instinct and

27
00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.740
experience with the science of data and
analytics.

28
00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.830
So the decisions like growing or

29
00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.590
shrinking the business or collaborating
with competitors are seen more clearly.

30
00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.253
We will have more opportunities to
identify, model, and map multiple futures,

31
00:02:12.253 --> 00:02:17.604
reducing the risks of innovation and
accelerating the decision making process.

32
00:02:17.604 --> 00:02:21.753
So that we'll not only be there for
the next big breakthrough,

33
00:02:21.753 --> 00:02:23.720
we'll be leading the field.

34
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.800
Executives in highly data driven
organizations are three times more likely

35
00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.549
to report significant
improvements in their decisions.

36
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:40.410
So, in a world where opportunities
are more complex and more accelerated, and

37
00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:46.250
technology will continue to deliver
evermore data, inform our experience

38
00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.060
with analytical power for
those decisions that really count.

39
00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.010
By blending the art of leadership and
judgment with

40
00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.390
the science of analytics excellence,
we can make better and faster decisions.

>> In this video,

46
00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.960
you heard how organizations make
thousands of decisions every day.

47
00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.660
Some are simple, but
some are very complex and

48
00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.670
can shift the course of a business or
industry.

49
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.590
These big decisions set the direction for
a business.

50
00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.800
Data and
analytics help solve these problems.

51
00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.680
In the next video,

52
00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.370
