00:00:12.173 --> 00:00:13.499
Welcome back.

3
00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:16.797
In this video,
we'll address how companies use data and

4
00:00:16.797 --> 00:00:21.277
analytics to improve decision making
by sharing a few case studies with you.

5
00:00:21.277 --> 00:00:26.116
Organizations are constantly trying to
improve and transform, whether to address

6
00:00:26.116 --> 00:00:30.357
periodic strategic challenges or
everyday operational improvements.

7
00:00:30.357 --> 00:00:33.260
There is a process to
business decision making.

8
00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.768
We know executives pay attention to
what data and analytic tells them,

9
00:00:36.768 --> 00:00:39.630
that's the science part of the equation.

10
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.260
But we also know they rely
heavily on the art of intuition.

11
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.360
Where their own experience, market
insight, and what they hear from advisers.

12
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.111
Let me walk you through a fine example.

13
00:00:51.111 --> 00:00:55.806
For those of you who don't immediately
recognize the face, this is Dick Rowe,

14
00:00:55.806 --> 00:00:57.570
a music industry executive.

15
00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.394
Dick made a decision in 1962
that guitars were fed, and

16
00:01:01.394 --> 00:01:04.310
he wasn't going to
invest in guitar groups.

17
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.650
Dick made a decision to
not sign the Beatles.

18
00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:09.380
Bad decision.

19
00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.600
But luckily for Dick,
he learned from that decision and

20
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.909
was redeemed when he later
signed the Rolling Stones.

21
00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.025
More than 50 years later,
many business leaders continue to

22
00:01:21.025 --> 00:01:24.540
rely heavily on intuition to
make really important decisions.

23
00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.460
Our PWC big decision survey

24
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.450
has revealed that highly data-driven
organizations are three times more likely

25
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.970
to report significant
improvement in decision making.

26
00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:43.180
But only one in three executives say
their organization is highly data-driven.

27
00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.930
In conversations with business leaders,
we often hear that executives have

28
00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.830
readily available access to vast
amounts of data at any point in time.

29
00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.535
But we also hear that a major factor
in their decision making comes from

30
00:01:56.535 --> 00:01:59.018
their own intuition or gut feeling.

31
00:01:59.018 --> 00:02:05.326
The question is, how to better combine
the art and science of decision making?

32
00:02:05.326 --> 00:02:10.806
At PWC, we believe a more effective use of
data combined with the ability to extracts

33
00:02:10.806 --> 00:02:16.380
insights, offer opportunities for
organizations to drive greater value.

34
00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.840
Embedding analytics into the decision
making culture of an organization can help

35
00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.810
organizations grow and innovate, operate
more efficiently, and better manage risk.

36
00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.710
Let me share a few
examples from our clients.

37
00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.210
An airline wanted to reduce flight delays,
or

38
00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.160
cancellations caused by
maintenance related issues.

39
00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.960
By combining the fleets message center
data with maintenance log information.

40
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.690
PWC helped develop an analytical model

41
00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.290
to predict up to 30% of maintenance
delays before they occurred.

42
00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.520
The cost savings to the organization
was in the millions of dollars for

43
00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.460
the pilot stage of the effort.

44
00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:56.640
Thereby helping the airlines stay ahead of
it's competition on timely performance.

45
00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.257
Another client of global financial
services organization needed to strengthen

46
00:03:03.257 --> 00:03:08.057
its internal anti-money laundering and
counter terrorist financing controls.

47
00:03:08.057 --> 00:03:12.752
Besides the obvious benefits from this
program, they also wanted to improve

48
00:03:12.752 --> 00:03:16.950
regulatory relations and
gain deeper insight into their business.

49
00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.416
PWC develop a model to connect
the series of data sets and

50
00:03:20.416 --> 00:03:25.823
performed trend analyses that uncovered
a network of relationships among accounts.

51
00:03:25.823 --> 00:03:29.400
Enabling the organization to improve
its overseas transaction monitoring.

52
00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.370
We also developed real time dashboards and
visualizations to more efficiently monitor

53
00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.360
for suspicious activity and
identify operational risks.

54
00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.140
Lastly, we worked with an oil
field services organization

55
00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.570
to improve utilization of
its field office staff.

56
00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:48.820
With our client,

57
00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:54.430
we combine the organization's global field
activity data with utilization, cost,

58
00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.700
employee demographic and other information
to develop an analytical model,

59
00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.117
to improve operating cost, as well as
improve speed of response to its clients.

60
00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.400
So, lets recap what we covered in this
video on how businesses solve problems and

61
00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.770
where data and analytics fits in.

62
00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.170
Organizations are constantly trying to
improve, whether they are addressing new

63
00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:21.110
challenges and opportunities, or
trying to make operational improvements.

64
00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:25.910
When we overlay data and analytics on
this process, the result is better and

65
00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:27.568
faster decision making.

66
00:04:27.568 --> 00:04:30.712
In the next video, we'll take
an in depth look at the data and

67
00:04:30.712 --> 00:04:33.436
analytics process used to
help make big decisions.

68
00:04:33.436 --> 00:04:39.670
