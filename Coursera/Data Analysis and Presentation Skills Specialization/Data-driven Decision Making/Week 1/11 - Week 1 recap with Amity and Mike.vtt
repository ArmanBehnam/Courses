00:00:12.005 --> 00:00:13.587
You made it through the first week.

3
00:00:13.587 --> 00:00:15.339
You learned about why data and
analytics is important, and

4
00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:17.310
spent some time learning about
the data and analytics framework.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:23.190
You also had the opportunity to spend
some time this week hearing from our PWC

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:27.170
professionals, and they talked about
the skills needed to perform data and

7
00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.080
analytic tasks to solve problems.

8
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.920
>> You've now read and
discussed the white paper on careers and

9
00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:38.080
roles in data analytics and data science
in the professional services industry.

10
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.220
I know Amity would agree
that building data IQ and

11
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.640
related skills is quickly becoming
a requirement for a career in business.

12
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.010
>> Absolutely, Mike.

13
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.090
And by taking this course all of you are
building the foundation of knowledge that

14
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.090
