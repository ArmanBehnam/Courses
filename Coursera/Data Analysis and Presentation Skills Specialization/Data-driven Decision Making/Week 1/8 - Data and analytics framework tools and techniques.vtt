2
00:00:12.054 --> 00:00:13.602
Welcome back.

3
00:00:13.602 --> 00:00:18.112
Now that we have laid out the data and
analytic framework, we need to answer

4
00:00:18.112 --> 00:00:23.480
the question, what analytic techniques
can I use and what tools can help me.

5
00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.970
In this video, we're going to talk
about five types of data analytics, and

6
00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.350
the tools used to help build our analysis.

7
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:36.410
We categorize the types of analytics
that one can do into five types.

8
00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.560
Descriptive analytics, diagnostic
analytics, predictive analytics,

9
00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:46.550
prescriptive analytics, and
adaptive and autonomous analytics.

10
00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.120
These are the broad categories that
will help you deliver on the data and

11
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.010
analytics framework we discussed
in the previous video.

12
00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.110
The framework is abstract, but

13
00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.900
these types of analytics will
help you operationalize it.

14
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.550
As we discussed earlier, one of
the common uses of analytics in marketing

15
00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.990
is in cross-selling multiple
products to customers.

16
00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.080
When we looked at the outcome of
increasing the number of cross product

17
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.860
holdings of our customers,
we started with the descriptive analytics.

18
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.410
We looked at their data to profile
their customers with respect to

19
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.240
one product holders,
two product holders, etc.

20
00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.030
These profiles included
the sociodemographics of the customer,

21
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.980
their online and offline behaviors,
their attitudes,

22
00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.030
life stages at which they bought
these products, and so on.

23
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.300
Descriptive analytics helps you understand

24
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.380
the current state of
affairs in an organization.

25
00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.720
It lets you look at what
is happening today and

26
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.700
it's what has happened in the past.

27
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.680
This type of analytics typically
provides summarized information

28
00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.840
to understand currently existing
sales patterns or customer behavior,

29
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.450
customer profitability,
past competitor actions, etc.

30
00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.781
Specific techniques might
include simple box plots,

31
00:02:12.781 --> 00:02:16.900
histogram charts with means,
minimums, and maximums.

32
00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.293
Plotting the data in quartiles or deciles
across a number of different variables.

33
00:02:22.293 --> 00:02:28.790
Or computing statistical measures like
mean, mode, standard deviation, etc.

34
00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.550
Descriptive analytics is very powerful for

35
00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:37.430
understanding the current state of
affairs and for developing the hypothesis

36
00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.410
to anticipate where business problems and
opportunities may lie.

37
00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.960
It helps us answer the question,
what happened?

38
00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.600
For example,
from the descriptive analytics,

39
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.510
it was clear that a large proportion of
the customers of the insurance company we

40
00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.240
talked about in the previous video,
had only one product, and

41
00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.920
a very small number of customers
had four products or more.

42
00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.800
In addition, there were three
products that all had more or

43
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.215
less equal share within
the one product customers.

44
00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.180
After we had a good description of what
the cross product holding of the different

45
00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:21.810
customers were, we started investigating
why the cross product holding was so low.

46
00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.550
It turned out that the insurance company
had multiple channels to sell their

47
00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:31.640
products, captive agents, independent
agents and telemarketing staff.

48
00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.770
Each of these channels sold a specific
type of product well and this

49
00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:42.670
resulted in an equal number of one product
customers across all three channels.

50
00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.630
Given the expertise of these channels,
there was very little cross selling.

51
00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:52.070
Multiple product holdings was more
a result of customers demanding

52
00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:56.400
the additional products, as opposed to
any deliberate cross selling process.

53
00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:02.420
Diagnostic analytics helps you
understand why it happened.

54
00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.620
It provides the reasons for
what happened in the past.

55
00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:12.740
This type of analytics typically tries
to go deeper into a specific reason or

56
00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:16.370
hypotheses based on
the descriptive analytics.

57
00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:22.280
While descriptive analytics cast a wide
net to understand the breadth of the data,

58
00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:27.860
diagnostic analytics goes deep,
probing into the causes of issues.

59
00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:33.010
For example, we might look at creating
a decision tree analysis of the cross

60
00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:38.240
product holdings to reveal the types of
customers who have bought these products,

61
00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.620
the channels they use, the products
they've bought and when they bought them.

62
00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:48.800
Once we knew what some of the major issues
in a low cost product holding were,

63
00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.080
we started formulating
hypothesis on what we can do

64
00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.760
to increase cross-sale of products.

65
00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:01.690
We built predictive model to rank
customers on their propensity to buy

66
00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.820
a specific second or
third or fourth product.

67
00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:11.170
This predictive model was built
based on the understanding we gained

68
00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:16.300
from the two previous steps of
descriptive and diagnostic analytics.

69
00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.200
Next we have predictive analytics.

70
00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.080
Unlike descriptive or

71
00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:26.520
diagnostic analytics, predictive
analytics is more forward looking.

72
00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:32.420
Predictive analytics lets you envision
what could happen in the future.

73
00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:37.080
This type of analytics can help
the client answer questions like,

74
00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.390
what are my customers
likely to do in the future?

75
00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:43.010
What are my competitors likely to do?

76
00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:45.050
What will the market look like?

77
00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:49.150
How will the future impact my product or
service?

78
00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:53.510
Predictive analytics typically
predicts what could happen

79
00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:55.370
based on the evidence we have seen.

80
00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.060
In our insurance case study,
once we've built our propensity model,

81
00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:05.148
we were able to identify some of
the high potential targets for

82
00:06:05.148 --> 00:06:09.170
cross sale, and
what product they should be cross sold.

83
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:14.720
Given the different propensities to buy,
we computed the next best offer for

84
00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:20.830
each and every customer and how the cross
sell message should be personalized for

85
00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:23.940
each customer and distribution channel.

86
00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:28.915
Prescriptive analytics goes beyond
providing recommendations to actually

87
00:06:28.915 --> 00:06:33.045
executing the actions or
taking the decisions that are right for

88
00:06:33.045 --> 00:06:35.350
a particular situation.

89
00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:38.970
It does this by looking at
what happened in the past,

90
00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:43.020
the present state and
all the future possibilities.

91
00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:48.010
Prescriptive analytics provides
answers to the question, what steps or

92
00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:53.000
interventions need to be taken
to achieve the desired outcomes?

93
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.190
Often the intervention might be an optimal
solution given the circumstances.

94
00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:03.790
Or the best possible action given
the uncertainty in the environment and

95
00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:06.050
the limited information available.

96
00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:12.740
It frequently involves scenario analysis
and or searching for optimal solutions.

97
00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:17.170
Prescriptive analytics is powerful
in understanding the right actions

98
00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:22.610
needed today to address future
possibilities and put an organization

99
00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:27.378
the best possible position to take
advantage of future conditions.

100
00:07:27.378 --> 00:07:30.660
While we built a one off solution for

101
00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:35.430
the client to increase the cross-product
holding of their customers,

102
00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:41.120
what they really needed was an adaptive
and continuous system that learns

103
00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:46.350
from the behavioral interventions and
actions taken by customers

104
00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:52.190
to automatically change the
recommendations and try out new measures.

105
00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:56.710
Such an always-on insights
platform where the system builds

106
00:07:56.710 --> 00:08:01.850
a model of the real world, takes actions,
learns from the environment, and

107
00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:07.280
continuously adapts itself is the ultimate
adaptive, autonomous solution.

108
00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:13.150
Adaptive and autonomous analytics
is still in it's infancy,

109
00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:17.880
most systems today are either
predictive or prescriptive.

110
00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:22.690
Very few of them are completely adaptive,
or autonomous.

111
00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:28.990
However, there are a number of companies
that are building more adaptive, or

112
00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:35.350
autonomous analytic solutions where we
are eliminating the human in the loop.

113
00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:39.870
Autonomous car driving is a great
example of an adaptive or

114
00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:42.110
autonomous analytic solution.

115
00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:47.230
Adaptive and autonomous analytics
provides answers to the question

116
00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:50.170
how does the system adapt to changes?

117
00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:54.400
How can we run analytic
solutions on a continuous mode?

118
00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:59.770
Constantly learning and correcting its
behavior to optimize its performance.

119
00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:06.240
We may not want to build adaptive and
autonomous systems in all cases.

120
00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:11.680
There may be instances where we may
want to retain the human decision maker.

121
00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:15.970
But there may be other situations
where the speed of decision making,

122
00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:20.500
is such that having a human in
the loop may be counter productive.

123
00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:23.160
Algorithmic trading might
be one such example.

124
00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:28.920
Now that I've given you a high level
overview of the different types of

125
00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:33.980
analyses, let's look at the tools
available to help you perform each one.

126
00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:40.280
Descriptive and diagnostic analytics
usually rely on analytic tools

127
00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:44.380
that can handle manipulation
of large sets of data or

128
00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:49.040
that help visualize and
interact with summarized information.

129
00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:53.818
Examples include SQL,
Oracle database or Oracle DB,

130
00:09:53.818 --> 00:09:58.510
Hadoop/Spark, Tableau, QlikView,

131
00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:05.040
Microsoft Access, SAS, R, Python and
various statistical packages within them.

132
00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:09.540
Predictive and prescriptive analytics
have traditionally relied on

133
00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:14.460
analytics tools that have significant
mathematical modeling capabilities or

134
00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:17.790
scenario planning or
simulation capabilities.

135
00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:22.670
Examples of these tools include SAS,
R, SPSS,

136
00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:26.470
Python, and
various packages associated with them.

137
00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:31.200
Optimization tools like Garrobi,
ILOG, RiverLogic, etc.

138
00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:34.270
Simulation tools like Vensim,
AnyLogic, STELLA.

139
00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:36.360
Machine learning and

140
00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:41.695
deep learning tools, like Scikit,
TensorFlow, Caffe, Theano, etc.

141
00:10:41.695 --> 00:10:45.090
Natural language processing
tools like NLTK or

142
00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:47.810
Natural Language Tool Kit or OpenNLP.

143
00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:50.270
In this video,

144
00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:55.380
we talked about five different types of
analytics you can use to analyze data.

145
00:10:55.380 --> 00:11:00.200
Descriptive analytics helps you understand
the current state of the problem and

146
00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:03.010
answer the question, what happened?

147
00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:07.540
Diagnostic analytics helps you
understand why it happened or

148
00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:10.530
the underlying causes for
the observed data.

149
00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:13.410
Predictive analytics helps you understand

150
00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:17.190
what could happen in the future
given certain conditions.

151
00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:21.860
Prescriptive analytics helps you
understand the right course of actions

152
00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:25.330
needed today to address future concerns.

153
00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:29.920
Adaptive and autonomous analytics
helps you answer the question

154
00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:32.230
of how to continuously adapt to change.

155
00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:38.770
We also took a very high level look
at the tools available to help you

156
00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:40.500
perform these analytics.

157
00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:45.710
Later in the course, we will take a much
closer look at what some of these tools do

158
00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:47.420
and how they provide value.

159
00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:51.550
In the next video, you'll have
the opportunity to hear some of our PwC

160
00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:55.760
professionals talk about data and
analytics at PwC.

161
00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:59.855
And how it plays a role in over tax,
assurance and advisory or

162
00:11:59.855 --> 00:12:01.555
consulting practices.

163
00:12:01.555 --> 00:12:05.810
