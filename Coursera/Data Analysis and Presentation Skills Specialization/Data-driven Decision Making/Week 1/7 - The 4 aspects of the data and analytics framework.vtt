2
00:00:11.555 --> 00:00:14.290
There are four aspects to our framework.

3
00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:19.240
Outcomes, decisions and actions,
insights, and discovery.

4
00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:22.390
Beyond the emptied mind and

5
00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.950
walk our way backwards to define
the problem and analysis to redact.

6
00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.330
And each of the four aspects
we takes steps to ensure

7
00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.990
time to value from data analytics.

8
00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:38.410
During the discovery phase you
need to define the problem,

9
00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.830
develop a hypothesis and
collect and explore data.

10
00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.320
During insights,
you perform the data analysis.

11
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.000
Next comes actions where you link insights
to actionable recommendations and

12
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.760
an execution plan.

13
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.960
Finally, you review the outcomes that
have transformed the business or

14
00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.950
business unit or the industry.

15
00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:04.330
We start from business outcomes to define
the problem we are trying to solve.

16
00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.430
We often look at the questions
that need to be answered or

17
00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.140
the key issues that need to be addressed.

18
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.150
The metrics that need to be factored.

19
00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.570
This allows us to not only
define the problem but

20
00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:22.230
also state our hypothesis on how we
are going to impact the outcomes.

21
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:26.140
Once we determine the outcomes to be
achieved, we look at the decisions that

22
00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.400
the executives need to make, or
the actions that employees need to take.

23
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:37.240
This allows us to identify the critical
dependent variables, decisions or

24
00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.870
actions, or the output required to
make the right decisions and actions.

25
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.400
Based on the complexity of the problem and
the time available

26
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.810
we look at different techniques that
can be used to generate those insights.

27
00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.820
This typically starts with first
understanding what has happened so

28
00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.960
far, what the organization has done,
and how they can do it in the future,

29
00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.560
in order for us to help influence
key decisions and actions.

30
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.490
Once we have the techniques that will
generate the insights, we can look for

31
00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.690
the right data that is available.

32
00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.420
The data could be internal or
external to the organization.

33
00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.220
It can also be structured or unstructured.

34
00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.670
Most offered the data available,
the time available to obtain the data but

35
00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.600
influence the techniques that we could
potentially use for insight generation.

36
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.640
Well, this is an iterative process.

37
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.520
It is always better to start from the
outcomes and the hypothesis as opposed to

38
00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.820
the available data to generate the best
value from data and analytics.

39
00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.470
So let's recap the data
analytics framework.

40
00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.510
During the discovery phase you define
the problem, develop a hypothesis, and

41
00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.680
collect and explore data.

42
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.520
During insights you
perform the data analysis.

43
00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.490
Actions is where you link insights
to actionable recommendations and

44
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.280
then execution plan.

45
00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.990
Finally you review the outcomes of
long term objectives and solutions.

46
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:13.770
This framework allows us to move through
data analysis in an organized way and

47
00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:20.280
provide us with the process to follow as
we work with clients to solve a problems.

48
00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:26.056
In the next video, I'm going to talk about
the types of analysis you can perform and

49
00:03:26.056 --> 00:03:31.106
show you the tools that you can use
within the data analytics framework.
