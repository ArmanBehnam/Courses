2
00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:13.768
Great to be back with you again.

3
00:00:13.768 --> 00:00:17.132
In this video, Alex Mannela will
share where he's seen data and

4
00:00:17.132 --> 00:00:18.324
analytics in action.

5
00:00:18.324 --> 00:00:22.112
Adding value to business practices,
helping leaders make business

6
00:00:22.112 --> 00:00:26.500
decisions and where it's having an impact
from data modeling to social media.

7
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.160
>> Thanks Dan.

8
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.990
I'm Alex Mannella and analytics and
data has played a critical role to me and

9
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.360
my career over the past 20 years.

10
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.050
Data and
analytics continues to add value to

11
00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.670
organizations by examining
how decisions are made.

12
00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.320
Next generation analytics can
automate the way decisions are made

13
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.830
in areas like making inventory management,
financial risk management, and

14
00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.890
sensor data management.

15
00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.772
We now have greater accessibility to data.

16
00:00:55.772 --> 00:00:59.210
There is enhanced visibility
of relevant information and

17
00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.870
massive amounts of data
are now easily accessible.

18
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.260
This results in improved reporting
to clients and stakeholders.

19
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.070
We can use retail, social and clinical
data to precisely customize offerings and

20
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.480
marketing campaigns to consumers.

21
00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.890
We think about not just business to
consumer, but also business to business.

22
00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.770
Think about how the ability to use
employee data to search for and discover

23
00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:27.520
new needs can enable organizations to fine
tune optimal performance and efficiency.

24
00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.420
By using data and
analytics to identify emerging trends,

25
00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.920
organizations will be able to create new
service offerings for their consumers.

26
00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.920
And new business models who execute them.

27
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.080
Using data and analytics isn't
limited to only high tech industries.

28
00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.980
Whatever sector you operate in,
be it finance, healthcare, retail, or just

29
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:55.900
about anything else, data and analytics
can and will play a critical role.

30
00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:01.200
Some examples include: discovering patterns
in large numbers of service requests for

31
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.830
a large bank; discovering which brands
are most similar based on social media

32
00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.890
platforms and followers on each;
gaining insight

33
00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.120
into an annuity policyholder behavior
based upon terabytes of consumer data.

34
00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.900
Now, when one observes or collects data
firsthand, this is called primary data.

35
00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.260
Primary data is very valuable in
getting consumer behavioral insights.

36
00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.690
If asking a consumer what kind
of coffee they like or what

37
00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.320
kind they intend to purchase, we don't
learn what they've actually purchased.

38
00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.430
That's where secondary data comes in.

39
00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:42.060
Secondary data is data that is
collected by someone or something else.

40
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.010
In this case, one could collect the data
from someone's credit card statement and

41
00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.160
determine whether or
not they actually bought the coffee.

42
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.830
Both primary and secondary data are used
in building strategic decisions.

43
00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.670
Big marketing decisions and
M and A decisions and beyond.

44
00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.500
Right now, rapidly evolving technology and

45
00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.850
the availability of real time data is
allowing organizations to use data

46
00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:13.500
analytics as the true game changer and
the table stakes of the future.

47
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.420
Organizations are collecting massive
amounts of data about their customers, and

48
00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.780
the customers are expecting that this
data is used intelligently and precisely.

49
00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.610
Our clients are coming to us because their
customers are expecting that this data is

50
00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.040
to be used to improve communications,
improve products,

51
00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.140
and ultimately the services
that are being offered.

52
00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.100
If an organization is going
to be an industry leader or

53
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:44.020
an innovator, analytics is key
to understanding correlation and

54
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.270
causation in turning
strategy into reality to.

55
00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:53.770
Organizations today are facing information
overload as data increasingly comes at

56
00:03:53.770 --> 00:04:00.150
them in new formats, and at faster speeds
and higher volumes than ever before.

57
00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:05.010
They have to use a combination of
techniques, including simulation and

58
00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:11.250
visualization to manage, manipulate and
organize this torrent of data.

59
00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.550
So they can address the progressively
complex decisions they have to make

60
00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:21.750
from operational control, to management
control, to strategic planning.

61
00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:26.490
Our clients are now trying to figure out
how they build information insights.

62
00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.820
The groups,
the analytic centers of excellence, and

63
00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.590
how to take these organizations
to the next level to drive value.

64
00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.050
What does the organizational
structure need to look like?

65
00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:39.550
What does it mean?

66
00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.990
It's not just the data and analytics.

67
00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.660
If you can't get the data through
the organization efficiently,

68
00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.860
it's just a statistical model or
it's just an answer.

69
00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.310
Our clients are challenging us on
a daily basis to help them figure out

70
00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:59.450
what an organization that fully uses
the data and analytics must look like.

71
00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:01.470
What do the models look like?

72
00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.240
Another vital source of
data is social media.

73
00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:10.620
Generally, social media is defined as
a set of internet technologies that allow

74
00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:17.040
users to generate and share content,
collaborate, exchange ideas and

75
00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:22.400
form community with shared or
opposing interests.

76
00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.880
Social media can be good or bad.

77
00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.900
So many clients think there is so
much to find, but

78
00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.190
there is a lot of noise in social media.

79
00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:33.380
So how do you extract that
signal from the noise?

80
00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:37.240
It's important to look at data
collected from social media platforms,

81
00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.760
along with all other relevant datasets.

82
00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:45.850
Social media is a powerful platform but
it's one that many organizations

83
00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:52.420
are chasing, and don't have a sound social
media or overall integrated data strategy.

84
00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:54.070
When you think about data and analytics,

85
00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:58.720
you need to think about the social
media strategy in the organization.

86
00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.210
What can someone bring
from a social perspective?

87
00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:05.960
Being able to challenge how
social media is being used, and

88
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:10.090
if it's going to be used from
an analytics perspective.

89
00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:14.670
Whatever social media data an organization
is trying to use, it's very important that

90
00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:19.990
you tie it to other relevant data
sets to validate findings and

91
00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:25.200
ensure the accuracy of
what you are projecting.

92
00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.530
We've seen our organizations
misuse data from social media and

93
00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:32.840
not tie it back to other data assets
that they have into the analytics and

94
00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:34.620
models that they are building.

95
00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:40.040
When used properly, data and analytics
can change how organizations operate,

96
00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.310
allowing them to become more efficient and

97
00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:47.340
have greater impact on their bottom line
and most importantly, their customers.

98
00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:52.430
Now let's look at how data and analytics
can be used in the retail industry.

99
00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:57.950
Companies can use consumer purchase data,
social networks,

100
00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:02.490
and geolocation information
to optimize product mixes and

101
00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:05.460
make decisions related
to product development.

102
00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:10.130
For example, a retailer can use data
generated from consumer mobile devices for

103
00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:12.840
location based sales and offerings.

104
00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.770
Take a local drug store where
a customer has their mobile

105
00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:17.060
app installed on their phone.

106
00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:21.920
The drugstore can push
a notification if you are nearby

107
00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:25.910
because it uses your geolocation
information efficiently.

108
00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:31.530
Organizations can also use data from
mobile devices for payments and

109
00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:32.940
purchase patterns.

110
00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:36.580
The organization can go well
beyond just pushing offers,

111
00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:41.480
but using the data and analytics to
optimize products and segments is

112
00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:46.400
one of the core components that underlies
social media and data analytics.

113
00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:51.360
The operations department at the same
retailer can evaluate store traffic

114
00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:56.490
patterns to improve product placement and
point of sales processes.

115
00:07:56.490 --> 00:08:00.190
And finally, the service
department can evaluate online and

116
00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:05.160
real time interactions to improve and
tailor in-store and

117
00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.030
post-sale experiences.

118
00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:12.940
Another example of data analytics in
action is from the healthcare industry.

119
00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:17.930
In terms of product development, analysis
of disease trends in clinical studies

120
00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:23.080
can direct, and optimize research and
development efforts for drug discovery.

121
00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:26.530
Data can help bring new drugs
to market more quickly, and

122
00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:30.970
more efficiently, using things like
claims data to more efficiently

123
00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:35.900
communicate with policyholders on
how they can manage their health and

124
00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:41.950
prevent specific disease or illnesses from
happening, diabetes or the common cold.

125
00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:45.560
Analysis of patient history and
disease patterns allows sales and

126
00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:51.010
marketing teams to target patients
with care or lifestyle improvements.

127
00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:53.790
By using claims data and
patient demographics,

128
00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:58.900
hospitals can improve operations by
optimizing treatment selections.

129
00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:03.220
And in terms of customer service, health
care providers can improve treatments and

130
00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:07.700
manage chronic illnesses through data
collected from ongoing patient monitoring.

131
00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:13.360
As the processing capacity of data
analytics continues to increase, it opens

132
00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:17.820
the door to a broad range of advanced
algorithms and modeling techniques that

133
00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:23.390
organizations can employ to draw a valuable
insights from data and analytics.

134
00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:27.940
There are different ways to model
structured and unstructured data.

135
00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:30.630
Of course there
are the traditional methods, but

136
00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:35.200
we also see many new modelling techniques
emerging to handle all the different types

137
00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.880
of data that is available.

138
00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:40.860
For the analytics individual or
for the advanced data scientist,

139
00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:45.020
there are a portfolio of methods that
can be used today, more so than ever,

140
00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:49.550
given the advancements in processing
power, mathematics, data storage and

141
00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:51.790
most importantly visualization.

142
00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:55.950
In summary, what has fundamentally
changed are three critical things.

143
00:09:55.950 --> 00:10:00.950
Having the right people, the right tools,
and the right algorithms in place to take

144
00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:04.960
advantage of the massive amounts of data
that organizations have access to today.

145
00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:10.560
>> Thanks Alex, for those terrific
insights into data and analytics.

146
00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:15.310
In this video, we've learned how data and
analytics is helping add value to business

147
00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:22.470
practices And becoming a critical game
changer in making business decisions.
