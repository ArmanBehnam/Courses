2
00:00:11.444 --> 00:00:15.267
In this video we're going to discuss
how organizations capture data,

3
00:00:15.267 --> 00:00:19.039
how they store and process it, and
ultimately how they visualize it.

4
00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:25.060
One piece of data won't provide much value
but when you look everything holistically,

5
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.890
the result will be better
decision making and insights.

6
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.520
With the very different types of data that
are available today, there are traditional

7
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.610
approaches and emerging approaches to what
organizations are doing with their data.

8
00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.780
Let's start by talking about
the traditional approach where you need to

9
00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.170
extract data from a relational
database in order to develop

10
00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.940
a traditional segmentation
model from marketing program.

11
00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.120
To share this with your client, you can
use tools like Excel, and Access and

12
00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.330
PowerPoint to tell the story and
communicate the results.

13
00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.920
When you think about new types
of data that are available

14
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.600
you need to take an innovative approach.

15
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.310
An example of this would be when you
have multiple types of data coming from

16
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.450
traditional databases as well
as something like social media.

17
00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.750
You have all these different types of
data that you need to bring together

18
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.110
in order to build insights.

19
00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.990
Using these different types of
data, you can tell the story of

20
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.800
what it means using advanced
visualization tools.

21
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.500
All of this data combined
can be used in a way that

22
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.410
allows organizations to make
decisions in real time.

23
00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.110
You'll hear more about the different
types of data later this week but

24
00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.850
data available to organizations is
coming from a wide variety of sources.

25
00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:42.520
Mobile, web, email, social media, sensors,

26
00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.320
operational data, logs, texts,
the lists goes on and on.

27
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.870
With all of this data we need to
look at four things to figure out

28
00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.520
how we will get the insights
from this data.

29
00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.660
One, how do we get the data?

30
00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.010
Two, how do we store it?

31
00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.660
Three, how we process the data?

32
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.250
And four,
how are we going to visualize the data?

33
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.570
Here is an example of how we can
capture different types of data

34
00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:12.110
through one interaction and

35
00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.460
use it make operational changes to
improve the customer experience.

36
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.000
Let's say your client is
a national pharmacy chain.

37
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.600
A customer uses her mobile device to chat
with customer service when she has issues

38
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.840
with her prescription not being filled
in a reasonable amount of time.

39
00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:30.960
From this single chat,

40
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.070
the organization is able to collect
three primary pieces of data.

41
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.690
The device the customer
is using to communicate.

42
00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.710
Texts from the logs that are being
captured during the chat.

43
00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.730
An indicator of
the customer's preferences on

44
00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.190
the channel that they
choose to communicate.

45
00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.580
We can use this data and visualize it to
unveil segments in the customer population

46
00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.390
that have an affinity for
one channel or the other.

47
00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.800
I just talked about gathering data from a
mobile device but how else do we get data?

48
00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.230
Manual input,
point of sale systems, web forms,

49
00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.990
sensors, you get where I'm going and
I bet you can probably think of many more.

50
00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.130
Let's say, you have a client that is
looking to increase multimedia sales.

51
00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.090
We start by looking at
purchase patterns in

52
00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.240
multimedia, and use this
to develop better marketing strategies.

53
00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.390
What platforms are your customers using
to purchase multimedia, such as music,

54
00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.420
movies, or television shows?

55
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:26.950
When are they purchasing them?

56
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.800
How much are they purchasing?

57
00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.700
Not just understanding the segments, but
also the price points, the timing, and

58
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.350
the preferences for
one piece of multimedia over another.

59
00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.400
We can get all of these data
from traditional data stores

60
00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.310
as well as from other sources like third
party data suppliers, social media, and

61
00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:47.730
user device data.

62
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.020
How do we store the data?

63
00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.790
In the digital age,
there's so much data but

64
00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.150
warehousing every bit and
byte isn't always the answer.

65
00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:57.970
It has to be high quality data.

66
00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.320
It has to be where organizational
leaders can access it.

67
00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.940
And it has to be the data they
need to help assess their risk and

68
00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.670
pursue strategic opportunities.

69
00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.900
You need to think about the type
of data being collected.

70
00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.770
The granularity of the data.

71
00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:15.520
The time the data is captured.

72
00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.170
And the completeness of the data set.

73
00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:22.150
It's not up to an analytics person
to store the data efficiently.

74
00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.150
We work with our technology people and
think about the business prob and

75
00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:27.930
the data we're trying to collect.

76
00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.110
Understanding that the platforms
will continue to evolve,

77
00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.910
there will be traditional and
emerging platforms and it's

78
00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.290
up to the data scientist to help to find
the analytics path and the data they need.

79
00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.570
It is necessary to have a base
understanding of the different platforms

80
00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:49.350
so that we're asking intelligent questions
to store the data that is out there.

81
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.160
In many organizations, a data and

82
00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.230
analytics person would work with
the technology department to figure out

83
00:04:55.230 --> 00:05:00.370
what the right platform is to collect,
store and analyze the data.

84
00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.920
How do we process this data?

85
00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.960
Once organizations have the data and

86
00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.360
it's stored, the goal
is to transform it into

87
00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.950
insights that help address complex,
strategic and operational challenges.

88
00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:15.840
And in many cases gain that
competitive advantage.

89
00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.570
Our clients often think it's an either-or,
but traditional and

90
00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:22.580
emerging data both serve a purpose.

91
00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:27.410
Structured data, available in databases
and spreadsheets fit into the traditional

92
00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:33.070
model, and social media and wearable
data fits into the emerging platforms.

93
00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:37.830
It's up to the people doing the analytics
in an effective technology team

94
00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.060
to figure out the best platform.

95
00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.150
How do you process these data sets?

96
00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:47.140
We use software packages like SAS,
R, Excel and Access.

97
00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:51.330
But it's on us as the analytics team
to work with our clients to identify

98
00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:56.410
the tools that will solve the issues for
us today but we also need think

99
00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:01.180
about what implication does that have for
building the organization in the future.

100
00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:06.160
We work with our clients to understand
the issues, come up with hypotheses and

101
00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.620
then determine if we need business
intelligent tools.

102
00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:13.770
And finally,
what tools help us visualize the data and

103
00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:17.250
tells us a story of what the data means.

104
00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:18.810
Let's talk about the key tools and

105
00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:23.060
technologies available to harness all of
the power of the data that's out there.

106
00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:28.120
There are static desktop graphics
like Excel or PowerPoint.

107
00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:32.520
We can use BI reporting dashboards that
are regularly refreshed to show important

108
00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:33.920
operational data.

109
00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:38.770
An example is Microsoft Power BI which
is a collection of online services and

110
00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:41.400
features that enable users to find and

111
00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:46.350
visualized data, share discoveries and
collaborate in intuitive ways.

112
00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:50.890
There is Google's platform,
dynamic web or there's G predicts.

113
00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:55.540
All our tools that our analytics
teams work on with our clients.

114
00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:59.070
There are also dynamic web
visualization tools that allow for

115
00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:03.280
interactive visualization,
like QlikView, Tableau and Spotfire.

116
00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:10.200
Next week, you'll learn about some of
the uses and the benefits of these tools.

117
00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:14.360
In this video, we talked about
how organizations capture data,

118
00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.950
how they store it, how they process it.

119
00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:22.500
And finally, how they visualize it and use
to tell a story or answer a key question.

120
00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:25.150
