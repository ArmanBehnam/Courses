00:00:11.765 --> 00:00:14.731
Welcome back,
you're halfway to the end of this course.

3
00:00:14.731 --> 00:00:19.003
This week, you spent a lot of time
learning about the different types of data

4
00:00:19.003 --> 00:00:21.023
that can be used to solve problems.

5
00:00:21.023 --> 00:00:25.097
You heard a few of our PWC professionals
talk about these different types of data,

6
00:00:25.097 --> 00:00:28.600
how they're used, and how technology
is impacting data analytics.

7
00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:30.650
Throughout my career,

8
00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.630
the data that's been available to use to
solve problems has changed significantly.

9
00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.580
When I began my career,
data gathering was manual, pen to paper.

10
00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:43.680
Today, with the digital capabilities
around us and the amount of data being

11
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.000
captured, our enhanced abilities to
analyze data and draw conclusions from it

12
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.690
allow us to provide our clients
with real time insights that impact

13
00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.018
their business decisions faster than ever
before and on a more informed basis.

14
00:00:57.018 --> 00:00:58.200
>> That's right, Amity.

15
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.390
For anyone considering a career in
business today, the ability to frame and

16
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.370
solve problems using data analytics
is really an essential skill.

17
00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.440
>> Now that you can differentiate, between
different types of data, next week,

18
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.520
you'll learn about the different
techniques used to perform data analysis.

19
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.034
And look at tools like Excel, R, and
Tableau that analyze and visualize data.
