00:00:11.499 --> 00:00:12.757
Welcome back.

3
00:00:12.757 --> 00:00:16.860
In this video we're going to look
at the business implications of

4
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.558
technology advancement and datacrytes.

5
00:00:19.558 --> 00:00:23.640
Data and
analytics is impacting every industry.

6
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.530
Let's start with agriculture,
one of the oldest sectors.

7
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:31.680
Farmers are typically use their
experience and the weather to

8
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:37.090
decide when to plant seeds, when to
irrigate them, and when to harvest them.

9
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:42.470
But now thanks to advance analytics,
they can log into a system and

10
00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:48.290
analyze the best time to plant their
seeds to obtain the best yield.

11
00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.780
Precisely when to irrigate which
part of the multi acre farm.

12
00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.160
In another example,

13
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.410
a high network young professional
logs on to a rover advance platform.

14
00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.380
Selects the money if you want to
invest for the next two years and

15
00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.962
let the system know our risk appetite.

16
00:01:05.962 --> 00:01:11.520
The robo-advisor then selects
the right mutual funds and ideas or

17
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.730
exchange traded funds that she should
own buys them through the exchange and

18
00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.337
continuously monitors
the value of her portfolio and

19
00:01:20.337 --> 00:01:23.640
is ready to sell if
the situation warrants.

20
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.100
When we look at what's
going on in the world

21
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.010
we can see three major implications
of technology advancements.

22
00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.860
Customers are changing the way
they choose products and services.

23
00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.560
Competitors are faster and
nimbler than ever before.

24
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.530
Supply chains are more complex and
diverse.

25
00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.250
Let's start by talking about how
customers are changing the way

26
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.010
they choose products and services.

27
00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:57.010
Online sales of products is increasing,
and organizations need better

28
00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.965
online marketing and
access to optimal distribution channels.

29
00:02:01.965 --> 00:02:08.540
At the same time, customers increasingly
rely on information from social media.

30
00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:13.265
Organizations need to be aware of changing
customer behavior and perceptions.

31
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.860
The farmer practicing
precision agriculture

32
00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.865
is demanding timely information,
relevant and

33
00:02:21.865 --> 00:02:26.786
personalized information with respect
to their firm and what they should do.

34
00:02:26.786 --> 00:02:30.651
Similarly the high net worth
in professional is making

35
00:02:30.651 --> 00:02:35.090
decisions late at night from
the comfort of her home.

36
00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:41.540
In both cases, the customers trust their
online systems but have high demands

37
00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.940
on simplicity, personalization,
ease of use, and transparency.

38
00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:55.820
Next, let's consider how competitors
are faster and nimbler than ever before.

39
00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:01.960
For every organization time to market for
competitors has decreased.

40
00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:08.140
Managers at all levels need to access
information on market changes so

41
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.095
they can make quick adjustments
in product strategies.

42
00:03:12.095 --> 00:03:17.180
Although the initial decision supports
software product used by the farmer

43
00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:18.540
was from a start-up.

44
00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.390
It got acquired by a large
agri business company.

45
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.540
We see this again and again.

46
00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.880
Where start ups innovate and
established companies acquire them

47
00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.210
in order to become more nimble and
competitive.

48
00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:38.210
Now you see all of the major agribusiness
companies using advanced analytics

49
00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:43.570
censors and other technologies
to extract more from the farms.

50
00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.380
Similarly, the use of digital advice or

51
00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.760
robot advice is now no longer
restricted to just startups.

52
00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.360
There's an arms race within
the asset management sector

53
00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:59.060
to build better analytic tools for
their customers and advisers.

54
00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.750
Finally, supply chains
are more complex and diverse.

55
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.160
Better global connectivity
has allowed businesses

56
00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.270
to purchase imports from around the world.

57
00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:13.970
This makes purchasing
decisions more complex.

58
00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:20.060
Increasingly, industry sectors are
becoming more global and interconnected.

59
00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:25.150
Internet of things and sensors
are revolutionizing physical supply

60
00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:30.740
chains and enabling data driven
optimization and decisions.

61
00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.518
For example, the robo-advisors
can manage funds across multiple

62
00:04:35.518 --> 00:04:39.040
parties distributed across the world.

63
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.356
They can execute trades 24/7 and

64
00:04:41.356 --> 00:04:45.550
they're not dependent on
the traders in each local market.

65
00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:50.950
The business benefits from advance
data and analytics are four-fold.

66
00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:55.000
Increased revenues and
profits as companies look at

67
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.920
hyper targeting customers and
selling tailored solutions to them.

68
00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.450
Decreased cost and

69
00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:08.100
enhanced productivity as more automation
takes over from human decision making.

70
00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:12.960
Better customer experience as
the omni channel interactions for

71
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.690
why the convenience for customers and
the low cost for providers.

72
00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:19.420
Reduced risk and

73
00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:24.060
better quality as standardization and
automation become the norm.

74
00:05:25.078 --> 00:05:31.250
Increasingly, the workforce will be asked
to focus on high value tasks as more

75
00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:37.410
of the repetitive, manual and intellectual
tasks are taken over by machines.

76
00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:41.890
Over time, the ability to use data and
analytics and

77
00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:46.610
make data driven decisions
will become standard practise.

78
00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:51.030
PWC is recruiting with
this instate in mind.

79
00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:57.130
Data and analytics is becoming a part of
the rapporteur of all of our consultants.

80
00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:02.100
There are three key factors increasing
the relevance and importance of data and

81
00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:03.360
analytics.

82
00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:08.890
The amount of data generated has exploded
because of technology advancements.

83
00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:14.830
There are many new types of data available
that cover a much wider range of activity.

84
00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:19.380
The price point for infrastructure and
tools needed to capture and

85
00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:22.860
analyze this data as dramatically reduced.

86
00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:27.280
Making data collection and
analytics much more economical for

87
00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.170
the organizations that need it.

88
00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:34.540
In the new normal of lower growth,
regulated markets and

89
00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:39.618
cost constraints our clients
are increasingly considering data and

90
00:06:39.618 --> 00:06:45.900
analytics as unexploited assets they
can use to help them meet their goals.

91
00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:50.130
Technology has changed
the data we have access to and

92
00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:53.695
how we can analyze and
then visualize that data.

93
00:06:53.695 --> 00:06:59.400
We are now seeing things like big data,
non-traditional data,

94
00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:05.080
information synthesis, sophisticated
analytics and visual insights.

95
00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:08.290
Let's talk about what each of these are.

96
00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:13.470
The exponential growth of data and
computing power is multiplying

97
00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:18.340
the number of opportunities to
drive insights from information.

98
00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:20.450
That's what we call big data.

99
00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:25.415
Nontraditional data are telematics,
satellites, voice,

100
00:07:25.415 --> 00:07:30.520
video-to-text, and other emerging
technologies that create data

101
00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:34.350
from previously non-quantifiable concepts.

102
00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:39.310
Information synthesis is
a catchall term for how evolving

103
00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:44.690
data analysis and processing
technologies are increasing our ability

104
00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:50.410
to draw insights from complex,
messy and unstructured data.

105
00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:55.180
Sophisticated analytics are the advanced
techniques such as simulation and

106
00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:58.250
optimization that are making it possible

107
00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:02.590
to pursue previously
out-of-reach insights from data.

108
00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:07.740
Finally, there are visual insights
as data visualization disciplines

109
00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:12.510
mature organizations and
software tools are simplifying and

110
00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:17.050
accelerating the path to insights and
decisions.

111
00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:23.310
In this video, we talked about the major
implications of technology advancements.

112
00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:28.190
Customers are changing the way
they select products and services.

113
00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:32.860
Competitors are faster and
nimbler than ever before.

114
00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:37.070
Supply chains are more complex and
diverse.

115
00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:41.810
Think about how some of this changes
have impacted you personally.

116
00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:46.010
How have you chosen products differently
since the bought are social media?

117
00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:50.400
Compare this how you bought
products before social media?

118
00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:53.920
Think about other technology
advancements that you have seen.

119
00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:57.770
Then join your fellow learners
on the discussion board and

120
00:08:57.770 --> 00:09:03.230
engage in a dialogue on how technology
advancements have changed your behaviors.

121
00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:08.256
And from that consider the big
question in what ways do you

122
00:09:08.256 --> 00:09:14.449
think organizations need to use data
to help them think differently?

123
00:09:14.449 --> 00:09:20.734
