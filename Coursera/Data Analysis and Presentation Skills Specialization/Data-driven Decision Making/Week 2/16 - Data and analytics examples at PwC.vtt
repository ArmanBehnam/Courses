00:00:11.721 --> 00:00:16.447
In this video, you're going to hear some
of our PWC professionals have applied data

3
00:00:16.447 --> 00:00:19.770
and analytics to address
business challenges.

4
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.580
Including identifying
growth opportunities, and

5
00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.810
driving customer engagement
to operate more efficiently.

6
00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.470
While you watch this video consider how
organizations can use data and analytics.

7
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.202
This can be helpful to you when you engage
on the discussion boards with other

8
00:00:35.202 --> 00:00:36.848
learners following this video.

9
00:00:42.462 --> 00:00:45.217
>> Big data projects can be accomplished
in two to three months, and

10
00:00:45.217 --> 00:00:47.000
I'll give you an example.

11
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.400
We had a content provider client
that wanted to know more about

12
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.980
the effectiveness of placement of their
content within web storefronts and what

13
00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.760
was driving customer behaviors to go view
that content and purchase that content.

14
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.160
We're able to do that
analysis using big data and

15
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.680
analytics to show what customer behavior
was, what preferences there were,

16
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.890
and where that placement could drive
more customers to make purchases.

17
00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:17.550
In addition to that finding,
the answer that we came back with beget

18
00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.820
more questions, and that spawned a couple
of other initiatives within the company.

19
00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.890
We had a client in the communications
industry that has the ability to

20
00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.970
distinguish viewing patterns
of their customers.

21
00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.740
And what they wanted to do was
track what's called pathing, and

22
00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.850
following customers as they go from
channel to channel to understand,

23
00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.690
how do I optimize my advertising

24
00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.940
by making sure that the right
segments get hit with those messages.

25
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:54.190
The complexity of trying to figure out the
behavior of all of my customers quantified

26
00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:59.240
by all the channels and content that I
offer becomes a little bit mind-boggling.

27
00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.230
But if you plot that into some sort of
visual representation on neural net

28
00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.780
if you will, which shows the connection
points, the highest probability connection

29
00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.170
points between say news channel and
lifestyle channels.

30
00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.260
You start to understand and appreciate
the demographics, where they go and

31
00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.980
how do I target my advertising to
reach those people more effectively.

32
00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.410
>> There are a lot of new ways
that companies are using the so

33
00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.370
called big data technology and
new sources of data.

34
00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.330
Let me give an example, there's a very
rich, very large beverage company, and

35
00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.210
traditionally what they had done in
terms of stocking up supplies with

36
00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:43.550
the retailers was essentially
looking at what was the past demand,

37
00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.420
and based on the past demand,
they would essentially stock up the shelf.

38
00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.980
Of course, they'll adjust it for
seasonal variations.

39
00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.900
Some are winter and different days,
so they would do that.

40
00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.690
That's the way they were stocking out.

41
00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.850
And the issue was they had
a substantial stock problem.

42
00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.330
In other words, when a person comes to the
store they can't find the specific brand

43
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:05.999
of beverage that they wanted.

44
00:03:05.999 --> 00:03:10.215
So they might have the overall brand but
they may not have a light version or

45
00:03:10.215 --> 00:03:12.258
they may not have the right flavor.

46
00:03:12.258 --> 00:03:14.630
So they're always running into stock.

47
00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.956
And they did an exercise to
find out what the stock was and

48
00:03:17.956 --> 00:03:19.130
it was a substantial number.

49
00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.600
So what this particular organization did,
and they came to us,

50
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.720
and they had a number of people with
internally who were crunching through

51
00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:33.660
a lot of algorithms to find the right
optimal solution for stocking but

52
00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:39.050
none of that had actually included
interesting data from the external world.

53
00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:43.280
In fact, real time data,
real time data about other,

54
00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:50.140
is there a football match happening in
the vicinity of where these retailers are?

55
00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.980
What is the temperature
on a particular given day

56
00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.860
when that football match was happening?

57
00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:59.690
Taking into consideration
all of those leads to

58
00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.390
substantial variations in how we
want to stack up various retailers.

59
00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.977
And also they were able to do that in
a way that was able to combine that

60
00:04:08.977 --> 00:04:14.450
information but also disseminate the
information in a way that a normal person,

61
00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:19.225
a retailer, in a normal mom and
pop shop could actually use that data.

62
00:04:19.225 --> 00:04:24.255
So we help them bring in data
literally on a smartphone,

63
00:04:24.255 --> 00:04:29.284
and very simple ways of telling
them how much they should

64
00:04:29.284 --> 00:04:34.320
be stocking and
how often they should be stocking.

65
00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.710
And this is something which we
call intelligence at the moment.

66
00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.990
In other words, there is no point in
having all of the fantastic analytics

67
00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.570
happen in the head office where
you're generating those insights.

68
00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.790
They are not that useful if it doesn't
make it's way on the shop floor,

69
00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.240
as in this particular
instance had the retailer.

70
00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.097
And the retailers are not
statistical PhDs, so

71
00:04:56.097 --> 00:05:00.823
you need to tell in a way that they can
understand and they can input the values.

72
00:05:00.823 --> 00:05:02.120
So that's what we were able to do.

73
00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.560
>> You just heard two examples of data and

74
00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.280
analytics were applied to address
real life business challenges.

75
00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.775
Think about these examples and
spend some time with your fellow learners

76
00:05:13.775 --> 00:05:16.287
discussing data in action
on the discussion board.

77
