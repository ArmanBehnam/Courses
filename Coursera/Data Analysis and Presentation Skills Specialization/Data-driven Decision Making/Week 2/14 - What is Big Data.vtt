2
00:00:11.926 --> 00:00:15.832
In the previous videos, you have heard
some of our speakers talk about data

3
00:00:15.832 --> 00:00:18.690
sources like social media,
emails, and documents.

4
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.140
All things you may not typically
think of as data sources.

5
00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.610
In this video, we will define big data and
big data and analytics.

6
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.715
Look at the differences between
structured, unstructured, and

7
00:00:33.715 --> 00:00:35.390
semi-structured data.

8
00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.400
And talk about
the applications of big data.

9
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.530
For example,

10
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.620
a large bank was looking at improving
their customer satisfaction ratings.

11
00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.290
The bank traditionally measured CSAT,
or Customer Satisfaction,

12
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:54.000
and NPS, or Net Promoter Score,
as the two primary indicators.

13
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.930
Both these were traditionally
obtained from periodic surveys.

14
00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.532
We worked with the bank to obtain and

15
00:01:00.532 --> 00:01:04.279
link a large variety of
different sources of data.

16
00:01:04.279 --> 00:01:06.500
First, we used the surveys and

17
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.700
analyzed the natural language
text in the open comments field.

18
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.420
This gave us a good view of the topic
areas of concern to their customers.

19
00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:23.130
Second, we recorded all the calls coming
to the customer service call center.

20
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.690
Based on the speech analytics,
speech to text, and

21
00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.830
text analytics, we we're able
to identify the key reasons for

22
00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.980
the calls and the emotional state
of the callers and the responders.

23
00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:41.080
Finally, we analyzed the social
media channels to assess

24
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.970
what their customers were saying
about the bank and their competitors.

25
00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.870
This allowed us to build a complete
view of the customer's interactions and

26
00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:55.350
sentiments about the bank,
which helped them make better decisions.

27
00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.580
The amount of information available
is exploding as digitarization, and

28
00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.500
the Internet of things, has increased
the number of data sources and

29
00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.630
the value and complexity of data.

30
00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:14.770
Now, we use big data as a term to
describe a collection of data sets so

31
00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.560
large and complex that it becomes
difficult to process using

32
00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:25.220
basic database management tools or
traditional data processing applications.

33
00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.930
The large data sets involved can
consist of numerous data formats

34
00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.010
in either a structured, a semi-structured,
or an unstructured form.

35
00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.710
Let's take a look at what we mean
by structured, unstructured,

36
00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.860
and semi-structured data.

37
00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:48.010
Think about the list of names, addresses,
and phone numbers found in a phone book.

38
00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.860
This is an example of structured data.

39
00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.805
It is well defined data,
like customer names, ages, identifiers,

40
00:02:55.805 --> 00:02:58.970
etcetera, that you can collect formally.

41
00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.030
The most popular platforms for
structured data include,

42
00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.980
Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server,
Microsoft Access, and so on.

43
00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:14.100
Big data can be associated with structured
data sources, but not exclusively.

44
00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.180
Now, lets look at unstructured data.

45
00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.730
Unstructured data is not broken
down into individual components.

46
00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.070
The data is a bunch of sentences
that you need to make sense of,

47
00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.850
like in a Word document.

48
00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.270
It is a collection of videos or
audio recordings on YouTube.

49
00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:37.100
It is millions of e-mails or
pictures or social media posts.

50
00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.360
It can be a recorded conversation.

51
00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.700
The challenge is,
how do you take this unstructured data and

52
00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.000
do something meaningful with it?

53
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.725
To understand semi-structured data,

54
00:03:48.725 --> 00:03:54.220
take that Word document that represents
unstructured data and add metadata.

55
00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.990
Tags to keywords so
that it is easily searchable.

56
00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:59.935
Now you have semi-structured data.

57
00:03:59.935 --> 00:04:05.120
Semi-structured data does not
conform to a structural format

58
00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.805
like relational or other standard formats.

59
00:04:07.805 --> 00:04:13.555
Semi-structured data includes tags and
other markers to separate data elements.

60
00:04:13.555 --> 00:04:17.170
Big data is not just about the data.

61
00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:20.390
It is about the interconnectedness
of the data.

62
00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:23.250
Big data sets can be linked together, and

63
00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.390
insights can be derived
from those linkages.

64
00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:32.770
Today, organizations capture and
store an ever-increasing amount of data.

65
00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:37.728
Internet availability, interconnectedness,
rapid connection speeds,

66
00:04:37.728 --> 00:04:42.798
and mobility contribute to the torrent
of data points being generated daily.

67
00:04:42.798 --> 00:04:46.860
Organizations want to
realize the potential value

68
00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:52.250
of these extreme size data sets, and
discard less and less information.

69
00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.900
Whether it is customer data or
internal data.

70
00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.440
However, the existing means to process and

71
00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.810
analyze data cannot scale to
extreme sizes economically.

72
00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:12.081
As far back as 2001, industry analyst
Doug Laney, currently with Gartner,

73
00:05:12.081 --> 00:05:17.777
articulated a now mainstream
definition of big data as four Vs.

74
00:05:17.777 --> 00:05:21.560
Volume, velocity, variety, and veracity.

75
00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:26.170
First, let's look at volume.

76
00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:29.820
Volume reflects the size of a dataset.

77
00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:34.880
New information is generated daily,
and in some cases hourly,

78
00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:40.250
creating datasets that are measured
in terabytes and petabytes.

79
00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:43.885
Many factors contribute to
this increase in data volume.

80
00:05:43.885 --> 00:05:47.880
Transaction-based data
stored through the years.

81
00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:51.530
Unstructured data streaming
in from social media.

82
00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:56.550
Increasing amounts of sensor and
machine-to-machine data being collected.

83
00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:00.800
In the past,
excessive data volume was a storage issue.

84
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.650
But with decreasing storage costs,
other issues have emerged.

85
00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:09.790
Including how to determine relevance
within the large data volumes,

86
00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:14.380
and how to use analytics to create
value from the relevant data.

87
00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:19.770
The second V we want to
look at is velocity.

88
00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:25.610
This reflects the speed at which
data is generated and used.

89
00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:29.190
New data is being created every second.

90
00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:33.160
In some cases, it may need to
be analyzed just as quickly.

91
00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:39.490
Radio Frequency Identification, or
RFID tags, sensors, and smart metering,

92
00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:45.050
are driving the need to deal with
torrents of data in near real time.

93
00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:50.010
Reacting rapidly enough to deal with
data velocity is a challenge for

94
00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:51.330
most organizations.

95
00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:58.870
Variety is the third V, and
it represents the diversity of the data.

96
00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:01.470
Data sets will vary by time.

97
00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:04.930
Social networking, media, text, and so on.

98
00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:08.570
And they will vary how
well they are structured.

99
00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:11.980
Data today comes in all types of formats.

100
00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:15.740
Structured, numeric data,
and traditional databases.

101
00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:19.880
Information created from line
of business applications.

102
00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:24.830
Unstructured data in the form
of text documents, email,

103
00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:30.420
video, audio, stock ticker data and
financial transactions.

104
00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:34.960
Managing, merging, and
governing different varieties of data

105
00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:37.800
is something many organizations
still grapple with.

106
00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:41.530
Next, we have veracity.

107
00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:48.420
Data veracity refers to the biases,
noise and abnormality in data.

108
00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:54.250
Is the data that is being stored and mined
meaningful to the problem being analyzed?

109
00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:58.300
Veracity in data analysis
is the biggest challenge

110
00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:01.069
when compared to things like volume and
velocity.

111
00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:08.010
In scoping out your data and analytic
strategy, you need to have your team and

112
00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:12.470
partners work to help
keep your data clean, and

113
00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:18.600
create processes to prevent dirty data
from accumulating in your systems.

114
00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:25.390
Even more important than the definition
of data is what data promises to achieve.

115
00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:31.330
Effectively used, data can be transformed
into insights and intelligence.

116
00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:35.330
Delivered where and
when they are needed to make and

117
00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:39.430
implement strategic and
operational decisions.

118
00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:44.920
There is one more V to take into account
when looking at data and analytics.

119
00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:47.080
And that is value.

120
00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:50.410
Having access to data creates value

121
00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:55.070
only when you have the right data
to clean strategic insights.

122
00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:58.350
Companies can generate
significant value from your data.

123
00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:00.770
An online retailer for

124
00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:05.640
example, was planning to enhance
their recommendation engine.

125
00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:10.380
The current software relied
on a static set of rules to

126
00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:15.490
determine one of five different
paths through their website.

127
00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:19.820
They wanted to modify this to
make recommendations based on

128
00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:25.040
the individual profile of the customer,
the amount of time they spend on a page,

129
00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:31.370
the keywords they enter, and what other
customers like them have done in the past.

130
00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:33.260
So just how big is big data?

131
00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.270
Think about these facts.

132
00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:40.970
More than half of new data created
is in video and audio formats.

133
00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:42.870
And by the year 2020,

134
00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:48.510
total global Internet traffic will
exceed 200 exabytes per month.

135
00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:51.810
An exabyte is equal to
1 billion gigabytes.

136
00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:57.680
Global mobile traffic will increase
to 30 exabytes per month, and

137
00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:01.540
will increase by 50%
combined annual growth rate.

138
00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:07.685
The total number of users with Internet
access will exceed 3.5 billion.

139
00:10:07.685 --> 00:10:11.790
The total number of mobile
devices will exceed 10 billion.

140
00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:14.940
Think about that for a minute.

141
00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:18.730
What does all that data mean for
organizations?

142
00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:21.630
How will organizations use this data?

143
00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:26.610
Big data is a game changer in
making business decisions.

144
00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:30.990
Let's look at how organizations
are currently using social media.

145
00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:37.270
In traditional use, businesses
use the convening power of social

146
00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:42.279
media to boost their image and
better anticipate consumer trends.

147
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:48.740
Few organizations have harnessed
the potential power of social media for

148
00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:53.150
applications beyond marketing and
public relations.

149
00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:54.700
Let's take an example.

150
00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:59.900
A large investment bank is worried
about its compliance risk.

151
00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:04.620
Regulators are monitoring customer
complaints made directly to them

152
00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:09.070
as well as the social media channels
of the financial institutions.

153
00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:12.680
The investment bank built
a social media dashboard

154
00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:17.111
that monitored customer complaints
on a regular basis made

155
00:11:17.111 --> 00:11:21.800
to their social media site as
well as other public forums.

156
00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:27.180
The dashboard captured the rate of change
of the number of messages on a particular

157
00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:33.060
topic, as well as the rate of change of
sentiment with respect to the same topic.

158
00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:37.670
This allowed them to react and
respond fast whenever there was

159
00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:42.680
a change in volume or sentiment related
to themselves or their competitors.

160
00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:46.390
Let's recap what we just covered.

161
00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:52.540
Big data is made up of structured,
unstructured, and semi-structured data.

162
00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:57.620
The amount of data that is being produced
is growing at an astounding rate.

163
00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:02.690
And the key to this data is
the interconnectedness of it all.

164
00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:05.470
We covered a lot of information here.

165
00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:10.340
You can use the interactive PDF
to review the big data concepts.

166
00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:15.013
In the next video, you will hear
from some of our PWC professionals

167
00:12:15.013 --> 00:12:18.857
about how we have used big
