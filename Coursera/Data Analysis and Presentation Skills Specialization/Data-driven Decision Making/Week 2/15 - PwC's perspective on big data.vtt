2
00:00:11.321 --> 00:00:16.310
In this video we'll share
PwC's perspective on big data.

3
00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:19.340
Big data's about much more
than technology and data.

4
00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.060
It's about how insights from data
can drive big decisions that solve

5
00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:24.780
real business issues.

6
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.820
Often creating innovation and
opportunity in the process.

7
00:00:29.162 --> 00:00:32.840
Success demands focus on the business
issue first, and data and

8
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.550
technology second.

9
00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.490
So let's hear our PwC professionals
share their perspectives on big data.

10
00:00:45.432 --> 00:00:49.287
>> PwC's 2014 Digital IQ Survey confirmed
something that many of us in the industry

11
00:00:49.287 --> 00:00:50.850
have thought for quite sometime.

12
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.150
Over 40% of all respondents
confirm that their big bet

13
00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.520
in the near future is going to
be on analytics and big data.

14
00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:05.310
>> When we talk about big data,
oftentimes people think about volume or

15
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:07.795
velocity, how fast it comes at those.

16
00:01:07.795 --> 00:01:11.610
I like to also think about as in variety,

17
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.660
how many different sources of information
do we have and that we can bring together?

18
00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.460
It is not uncommon now for
big data projects to take 20,

19
00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.490
30, 40 data sources and mash that
data up and drive value from that.

20
00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.100
If you think about, just the Federal
Government in the United States has

21
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.880
released about 300,000 different
data sets in the last five years.

22
00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.220
And it's going on and
it's getting more and more and more.

23
00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.930
And there's the federal government,

24
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.340
there's state and
local authorities that release data.

25
00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.050
There is commercially
available data sources.

26
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:53.088
It's part of the big data business is
to understand what's out there and

27
00:01:53.088 --> 00:01:57.300
to use the right sources of
information to derive value.

28
00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.110
>> Big data is not all about the data and
the technology,

29
00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.800
which is the two things that come to
mind when people think about big data.

30
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.710
Volumes of data and new technologies.

31
00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.235
We think that companies should be
thinking about three additional things

32
00:02:11.235 --> 00:02:15.050
in addition to big data and
big technology and big data technology.

33
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.080
One is the decisions that they make.

34
00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.910
So the big decisions.

35
00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:24.690
How am I making certain decisions, and
is there a better way of making those?

36
00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.170
More effective ways of
making those decisions,

37
00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.630
more efficient ways of
making those decisions?

38
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.650
And how can insights from the data, and

39
00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.180
the analytics that work on that data,
help me?

40
00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.840
So that's the number one that they should
be thinking about, the big decisions.

41
00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.420
The second one is also around
the big data analytics.

42
00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.730
So the data alone is not useful.

43
00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.801
Again, but given the volume
of data that's now available,

44
00:02:50.801 --> 00:02:54.150
extracting the insights
is a challenging task.

45
00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.860
So you're an essentially, literally
looking for a needle in a haystack.

46
00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.180
And to come to that needle,
you need to understand and

47
00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.110
frame your business problem and
business decision and

48
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.830
then use the analytics to generate those
insights or draw out that insights.

49
00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:15.260
Third thing that we also see
coming into form now as we compare

50
00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:21.080
more transitional organizations who have
been there in the industry for 20, 30, 50,

51
00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.330
100 years, was that some of the companies
that are, cropping up if you like,

52
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:30.020
in the Bay Area, there's a substantial
difference in their mindset.

53
00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.910
We call it the big data mindset.

54
00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.800
>> The opportunities for big data are to
really show what people are thinking,

55
00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.438
how they are behaving.

56
00:03:38.438 --> 00:03:43.210
And those insights had
heretofore never been available.

57
00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:50.020
Now we can really look into what
a customer thinks about a product.

58
00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:58.480
How a aircraft is operating at
the millisecond level in the air.

59
00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.460
We can look at traffic patterns and
use those traffic patterns to

60
00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.990
be able to pick the best group, real time.

61
00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:09.510
We've never been able
to those things before.

62
00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:10.100
Now we can.

63
00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.940
>> I think that a lot of the focus has
traditionally been on the technology and

64
00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:15.940
the data side of the house.

65
00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.760
However, we realize that to really
untap the value of big data,

66
00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.110
the business has to be engaged.

67
00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:31.140
I think that you have people sitting
on huge volumes of very valuable data.

68
00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:35.215
And another core group of people in
the business that would love access to it,

69
00:04:35.215 --> 00:04:39.250
that have questions, that might not
know how to ask the right questions.

70
00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.740
And that somehow those two have
to come together in order for

71
00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.380
companies to be successful.

72
00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:48.800
>> So I do believe that the industry and
the leaders out there do understand

73
00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.720
the transformative change that
can come from big data analytics.

74
00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.780
The question is now, how do we get there?

75
00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:01.190
And how do we get there is really
a very measured step-by-step approach.

76
00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:02.700
You should start small.

77
00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:06.150
Start with a very well defined business
problem and create value from there.

78
00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:11.780
>> You just heard some of our team talking
about their perspectives on big data.

79
00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:15.160
As Anan said, data alone is not useful.

80
00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.400
And considering the volume
of data we often start with,

81
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.260
extracting insights can seem daunting.

82
00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.180
Remember, you must first frame
the business problem and

83
00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:28.510
the business decision, and then use
the analytics to draw out insights.

84
00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:32.700
Start small, address a valid
business challenger opportunity, and

85
00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.010
create value from there.

86
00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:38.090
In the next video,
we'll look out how you gather data, and

87
00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:42.480
what tools you can use to analyze data.

88
00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:43.450
