2
00:00:10.922 --> 00:00:13.292
Welcome back to the second
week of the course.

3
00:00:13.292 --> 00:00:17.345
This week, you'll be joined by some of my
colleagues who will help you explore three

4
00:00:17.345 --> 00:00:21.003
different analytical methods used to
help us model different scenarios and

5
00:00:21.003 --> 00:00:23.400
deal with variable uncertainty.

6
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.530
These methods are scenario analysis,
sensitivity analysis and simulation.

7
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:33.920
We'll look at what each method is and then
go deeper into why and how you use each.

8
00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.850
We're going to start with scenario
analysis, which is a process

9
00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.680
of analyzing possible future events by
considering alternative possible outcomes.

10
00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.970
It often happens that our clients would
like to know what could happen or

11
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.130
would happen in various scenarios so

12
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.440
that they can make informed
decisions when moving forward.

13
00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.470
For example, one of my clients identified
an issue in their payment system that

14
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.700
resulted in overpayments
to some of their suppliers.

15
00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.760
Using data analytics, we helped our client
understand the extent of the issue, and

16
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.560
compiled a few options on how
they could fix it and when.

17
00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.310
Using scenario analysis, we show the
client how their data would be impacted,

18
00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.390
and the financial ramifications
in each situation, so

19
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.470
they could make an informed
decision on what to do.

20
00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.720
The client used the presented scenarios to
determine what fix made the most sense,

21
00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.980
and when IT should focus on this
effort versus other priorities.

22
00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.260
Next, you'll learn about
sensitivity analysis.

23
00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.280
A technique used to determine how
different values of one variable impact

24
00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.310
another under a given set of assumptions.

25
00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.550
Sensitivity analysis can be extremely
helpful when clients are trying to

26
00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.630
understand how their data
reacts to subtle changes.

27
00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.440
For example a health provider might be
interested in understanding what would

28
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.690
happen to their financials if their claims
were paid on average one day faster, or

29
00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.280
perhaps on average one day slower.

30
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.560
By slowly moving the levers,

31
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.790
we can see how sensitive their
financials are to these changes.

32
00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.930
The results form a model like this could
help the client set internal company

33
00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.299
policies and standards.

34
00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.970
Finally, we'll finish out the week
learning about simulations.

35
00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.190
A simulation involves changing
values of variables in a model

36
00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.750
in order to understand possible outputs.

37
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.550
One example of where
simulation model maybe useful

38
00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.810
is in helping a client prepare for
cyber breach.

39
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.200
By playing out what could
happen in a cyber breach and

40
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.880
adjusting the model accordingly, we're
able to capture various outcomes that can

41
00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.350
help the client understand how their
data can be impacted by their actions.

42
00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.960
A simulation like this can help shed light
on areas where procedures need to be put

43
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.230
in place or controls need to be turned
on in order to react quickly and

44
00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.880
mitigate as much risk as possible.

45
00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.520
In the following segments my colleagues
are going to guide you through

46
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.650
each of these analytical methods.

47
00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.340
Following their guided demonstration,
you'll be given a chance to

48
00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.950
practice in an Excel workbook and
demonstrate what you've learned.

49
00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.020
Each topic builds on the last, so
be sure to work your way through in order.

50
00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.250
And remember, Excel is a great
building block for other technologies.

51
00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.290
Once you understand and

52
00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.100
can apply concept in Excel, you can apply
similar concepts in other applications.

53
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.130
For example, the back code of Excel, VBA,

54
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.650
can also be used in other Microsoft
applications such as Word or Access.

55
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.590
In addition, functions similar
to the ones used in Excel

56
00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.540
exist in other programming languages,
such as SQL.

57
00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.510
Once you learn what can be done in Excel,
odds are you'll see the similar

58
00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.630
functionality exists in other
technologies and applications.

59
00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.500
Enjoy the lessons and
exercises presented this week.

60
00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.123
I'll be back at the end of the week,
thanks for joining me.
