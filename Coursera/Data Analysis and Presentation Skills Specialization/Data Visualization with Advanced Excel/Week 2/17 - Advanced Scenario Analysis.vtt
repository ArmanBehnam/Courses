00:00:11.303 --> 00:00:13.635
Hello, my name is Corey Gallon and
I help our clients solve complex problems

3
00:00:13.635 --> 00:00:15.470
in finance by developing
tailored analytical solutions.

4
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.990
I'm excited to introduce you
to the analytical concepts we

5
00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.540
will explore this week and provide
an overview of the use cases for each.

6
00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:32.600
When we are trying to solve
problems analytically,

7
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.720
many times there is not one
right answer to these problems.

8
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.620
In fact, it is good practice to develop
a sense of how our analytical solutions

9
00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.340
vary as we change our assumptions and
inputs to our analyses.

10
00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.170
This week we will study formalized
approaches to changing assumptions and

11
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.930
inputs to better understand
possible outcomes of our analyses.

12
00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.540
We think about these cases of questions
broadly as what if questions.

13
00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.620
For example,
what happens to my model output

14
00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.050
if I change the inputs to my
model across a range of values?

15
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.630
We'll look at three generally different
approaches to answering these, what if,

16
00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:20.260
questions, scenario analysis,
sensitivity analysis, and simulation.

17
00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:25.100
Scenario analysis involves the definition
of a specific state of the world, and

18
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.170
the related impact on variables
being analyzed, to capture and

19
00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:30.010
quantify outcomes.

20
00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.910
Scenario analysis helps
us formalize one or

21
00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.500
more possible answers to
questions about the future.

22
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.060
For example, what would the Net Present
Value of a particular capital project be

23
00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.720
if interest rates were to increase and

24
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.430
the project's lifetime
was decreased by 5 years?

25
00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.430
We can think about scenario
analysis as a story driven

26
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.174
what if analysis across one or
more variables.

27
00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.700
Sensitivity analysis involves changing
the values of an input to a model or

28
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.130
formula incrementally and
measuring the related change in outcomes.

29
00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.610
For example, what would the Net Present
Value of a particular capital project be

30
00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.491
as interest rates move from 1% to 15%?

31
00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.820
We can think about sensitivity
analysis as numerical

32
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.010
values driven what if analysis on one or
more variables.

33
00:02:26.545 --> 00:02:31.350
Simulation involves iterating through
possible values of one or more variables

34
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.009
of a model, in order to capture possible
and ultimately likely outcomes.

35
00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.210
Simulation can be deterministic,

36
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:43.350
in that we iterate over all
possible values of a variable, or

37
00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.990
non deterministic or random, in that
we iterate over values based on some

38
00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:52.085
assumption of the probability of
a variable taking on these values.

39
00:02:52.085 --> 00:02:55.940
For example given a 40%
probability of a $5

40
00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.510
increase in cost per unit in the next 12
months, what is expected profit per unit?

41
00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.680
We can think about simulation
as numerical values-driven

42
00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:12.380
what if analysis on one or more variables
across a range of probable values.

43
00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.790
We'll speak a little more about
each of these what if methods

44
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.140
as we work through the example
problems this week.

45
00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.430
Excel provides us a number of useful
tools to perform such what if analysis

46
00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.060
when we are building spreadsheet models.

47
00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.670
This week, we will develop
an understanding of using goal seek

48
00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.320
to back-into outcomes in our models,

49
00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:39.040
using solver to mathematically
optimize outcomes of our models,

50
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.700
using data tables to perform
sensitivity analysis of our models.

51
00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:49.340
Building scenarios for scenario analysis
using Excel's Scenario Manager feature.

52
00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.190
And lastly,
implementing simulation in Excel

53
00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.230
to better understand probable
outcomes as reflected in our models.

54
00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:02.070
We will explore each of these features of
Excel in depth as the week progresses.

55
00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:02.600
But for now,

56
00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.810
let's walk through a quick overview of
these powerful tools for what if analysis.

57
00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.060
Goal seek allows us to
answer what if questions,

58
00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.539
by starting first with
the outcome of the analysis.

59
00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:20.760
We tell Excel the value we want to see as
the output of a model and ask it to change

60
00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.330
one input value in our model repeatedly
in order to achieve the stated output.

61
00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.230
For example, in a capital budgeting
problem, if we wanted to know the discount

62
00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:35.830
rate we should use in order to achieve
a specific Net Present Value, we can use

63
00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:40.270
Goal Seek to determine the discount
rate to use in the NPV calculation.

64
00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.800
Solver is a powerful tool to help us
mathematically optimize outcomes in our

65
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:50.620
models to support scenario analysis such
as best case or worst case analyses.

66
00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.150
Mathematical optimization can be
thought of as determining the best or

67
00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.960
worst outcome subject
to defined constraints,

68
00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.490
from a group of alternative
possible outcomes.

69
00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:08.400
For example, we may ask, what is
the combination of capital projects,

70
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.200
that is, best case, I should pursue

71
00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.620
in order to maximize the Net Present Value
of my capital allocation?

72
00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.280
This is a simplified example and

73
00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:22.145
the built in Solver tool provided
with Excel is very powerful.

74
00:05:22.145 --> 00:05:24.610
But we will barely scratch the surface for
use cases for

75
00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.160
this potent optimization engine.

76
00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.310
We encourage you to explore Solver and

77
00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.357
it's many uses independently,
to enhance your own spreadsheet analyses.

78
00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:38.040
Excel provides us two convenient and
related tools for

79
00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.820
sensitivity analysis in
it's data tables feature.

80
00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:47.190
Data tables provide a useful tool to
change inputs incrementally to our models,

81
00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:49.690
either one or two at a time and

82
00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:52.800
determine the impact of these
changes on modeled outcomes.

83
00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:57.250
We could use a one way data
table to answer the question,

84
00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:01.250
how sensitive is a capital project's
Net Present Value to changes in

85
00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:06.030
the required return,
that is discount rate, between 1 and 10%.

86
00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:09.570
Excel also provides two-way data tables,

87
00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:12.130
which allows us to change two
variables in our model and

88
00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:15.170
observe the incremental impact of
these changes on modeled outcomes.

89
00:06:16.708 --> 00:06:20.740
Scenario analysis calls for
defining specific input to a model

90
00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:23.950
which relate to a specific story
driven state of the world.

91
00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:29.490
Excel provides a useful tool to capture
these different parameterizations

92
00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:33.890
of our model, to define scenarios
in it's Scenario Manager feature.

93
00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:41.390
Scenario Manager allows us to save inputs
to our model and therefore related outputs

94
00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:46.790
as named scenarios, to facilitate asking
these what if questions in our analysis.

95
00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:52.730
We may use Scenario Manager, for example,
to capture outputs of multiple scenarios

96
00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:57.680
which answer the question, what is
the Net Present Value under my best,

97
00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.655
moderate and worst case views of
the prospects for a given capital project?

98
00:07:01.655 --> 00:07:06.510
Excel provides a number of
functions which a system developing

99
00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:10.430
simulations of probable
outcomes in our analysis.

100
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:14.150
We will explore simulation
using the Monte Carlo method,

101
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:17.720
whereby we repeatedly allow
variables in our analysis

102
00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:21.890
to take on possible values in accordance
with probability distribution,

103
00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:25.850
in order to determine possible
outcomes of our analysis.

104
00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:29.330
We will discuss Monte Carlo simulation
more as we work through the related

105
00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:30.950
example this week.

106
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:34.940
And we encourage participants to
study this useful simulation method

107
00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:38.732
independently to gain a full
appreciation for its applications.

108
00:07:38.732 --> 00:07:43.411
When conducting data analysis, it is
important to understand the impact of

109
00:07:43.411 --> 00:07:48.177
changes in model variables to the outcomes
and conclusions of our analysis.

110
00:07:48.177 --> 00:07:50.995
We ask what if questions
in a variety of ways,

111
00:07:50.995 --> 00:07:55.299
though we'll focus on questions
pertaining to scenario analysis,

112
00:07:55.299 --> 00:07:59.690
sensitivity analysis and
simulation in particular.

113
00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:03.880
We'll explore answering these questions
using functionality Excel provides in it's

114
00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:10.430
Goal Seek, Solver, Data Tables,
Scenario Manager, and Simulation features.

115
00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:16.000
You'll need the Excel Analysis ToolPak
installed and enabled, as for

116
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.910
prior exercises in this specialization.

117
00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:21.180
We'll provide a refresher
on how to install and

118
00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:22.720
enable this add-on should you need it.

119
00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:28.010
As with week's previous, we will work
through example problems with you and then

120
00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:32.310
provide you with problems to work through
on your own to confirm your understanding.

121
00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:34.098
We encourage you to prepare for

122
00:08:34.098 --> 00:08:38.363
the culminating exercise at the end of
each module and use these exercises

123
00:08:38.363 --> 00:08:42.795
as an indication of your comprehension
of the concepts presented therein.

124
00:08:42.795 --> 00:08:50.616
Now let's dive in and explore answering
what if questions in our analyses, enjoy.

125
00:08:50.616 --> 00:08:56.761
