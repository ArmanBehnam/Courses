2
00:00:05.462 --> 00:00:09.714
In this exercise, we will go through
how to use Scenario Manager to try

3
00:00:09.714 --> 00:00:13.480
out different values in your variables and
compare results.

4
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.130
There are many ways to accomplish this
task, such as making copies of the same

5
00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.810
workbook and changing the input values in
different versions of the same workbook.

6
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.000
However, the simplest way to do this

7
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.480
is to use another tool in the What-If
Analysis called Scenario Manager.

8
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.180
Scenario Manager sets the parameters
we want to a certain value,

9
00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.250
calculate the results, then instantly
recalls and replaces the input

10
00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.960
value with different sets of numbers
based on the scenarios you have set up.

11
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.650
For our problem, the business development
team has asked us to explore the potential

12
00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.770
profitability and growth of a new flight
route under different market conditions.

13
00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.080
Here is a simplified version
of a income statement.

14
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.070
In orange are historical numbers for
the Ticket Revenue, Fee Revenue,

15
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:17.530
as well as Cost of Sales and
SG&A Expenses from the past three years.

16
00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:23.751
A simple calculation will tell us that
the company has achieved steady growth and

17
00:01:23.751 --> 00:01:29.347
operating income on this new road
expansion from 2014 to 2016.

18
00:01:29.347 --> 00:01:34.313
In row 66 to row 68,
the starting sheet has already calculated

19
00:01:34.313 --> 00:01:37.682
the Annual Growth Rate, the Growth Margin,

20
00:01:37.682 --> 00:01:42.400
as well as the SG&A Expense as
a percentage of ticket revenue.

21
00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.077
On the right side of the table,
we have projected revenue,

22
00:01:49.077 --> 00:01:53.350
costs, and expenses,
if revenues, costs, and

23
00:01:53.350 --> 00:02:00.819
expenses grow at the rate specified from
the assumption table in cells F66 to J68.

24
00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:05.844
The CEO has requested that we determine
how the projected performance of

25
00:02:05.844 --> 00:02:11.197
the company will look if there are changes
in how the company grows revenue and

26
00:02:11.197 --> 00:02:12.370
manages costs.

27
00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.120
In other words, we want to see how
the projected income statement changes

28
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.780
if the numbers in cell F66 to F68 change.

29
00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.432
In addition to the scenario
shown in this example,

30
00:02:26.432 --> 00:02:29.770
there are three additional
scenarios we need to consider.

31
00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.522
All the different sales Growth Rate,
Growth Margins,

32
00:02:34.522 --> 00:02:39.969
as well as different SG&A Expenses,
as a percentage of ticket revenue numbers.

33
00:02:42.717 --> 00:02:44.664
To set up your Scenario Manager,

34
00:02:44.664 --> 00:02:47.800
let's highlight the cells
that are going to change.

35
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:57.410
And then go to the Data tab >
What-If Analysis > Scenario Manager.

36
00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.720
Let's first create a scenario to
capture what we have on the table

37
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.200
as a baseline for comparison.

38
00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.480
In the Scenario Manager pop-up window,
click on ADD to create a new scenario.

39
00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.090
A new window called
Add Scenario will appear.

40
00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.238
First, let's give this scenario
a name called Baseline.

41
00:03:21.225 --> 00:03:26.124
Now, because we have already selected the
cells containing the variables we want to

42
00:03:26.124 --> 00:03:29.790
change, the Changing cell field
is already filled out for us.

43
00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.380
However, if you had not selected the cells
before going to Scenario Manager,

44
00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.920
or would like to change your selection,
you can also set the parameters here.

45
00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.410
If you would like to attach a note on
any clarification or background you

46
00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:51.540
want to provide for the scenario,
you can do so in the comment box here.

47
00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.030
However, it is not required.

48
00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:59.320
We believe it is best practice to leave
some comments just in case you or

49
00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.140
someone else wants to review
your assumptions in the future.

50
00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.805
However, in the interest of time,
we're going to leave this blank.

51
00:04:06.805 --> 00:04:14.870
Lastly, there are also options to Prevent
changes and Hide the scenario if you like.

52
00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:19.113
For our purpose, let's keep
the default setting and click OK.

53
00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:26.218
Then, you will be taken to the final
step of setting up the scenario,

54
00:04:26.218 --> 00:04:30.190
defining the value of each cell
to change in the scenario.

55
00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:37.132
The numbers that are already in cell F66,
F67, and

56
00:04:37.132 --> 00:04:43.950
F68 are the numbers we want to keep for
the scenario, so we can simply click OK.

57
00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:50.604
That will take us back to our
Scenario Manager pop-up window, so

58
00:04:50.604 --> 00:04:56.068
we can see the Baseline scenario that we
just set up in the list of scenarios.

59
00:04:56.068 --> 00:05:00.010
Now, let's set up the other three
scenarios using the same method.

60
00:05:01.068 --> 00:05:05.541
To set up our second scenario,
first, we'll click on Add and

61
00:05:05.541 --> 00:05:09.943
type in our scenario name,
High Growth with Margin Impact.

62
00:05:16.072 --> 00:05:22.020
The Changing cells in this scenario do not
change from the scenario we just defined.

63
00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.310
So click OK in the Edit Scenario window.

64
00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:30.365
In the Scenario Values window, we need
to update the values of the Changing

65
00:05:30.365 --> 00:05:32.080
cells for this particular scenario.

66
00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.821
Based on the scenario definition,
we want to change the first cell,

67
00:05:38.821 --> 00:05:41.961
which is the Revenue Growth Rate, to 0.08.

68
00:05:41.961 --> 00:05:47.760
The second cell,
which is the Growth Margin, to 0.45.

69
00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:55.110
And keep the SG&A expenses as a percentage
of ticket revenue the same at 0.3.

70
00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:58.398
After the variable's
values have been updated,

71
00:05:58.398 --> 00:06:01.380
click on OK to complete
the second scenario.

72
00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:06.730
Notice how the results of the income
statement changed based on our new

73
00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:07.644
assumptions.

74
00:06:09.755 --> 00:06:14.460
Operating Income in year 5
changed from around $1.7

75
00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:17.604
million to around $2.2 million.

76
00:06:20.292 --> 00:06:23.693
The third scenario will be very similar.

77
00:06:23.693 --> 00:06:28.497
Let's click on Add and
type in your third scenario name,

78
00:06:28.497 --> 00:06:31.209
Low Growth with Margin Impact.

79
00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:42.286
The changing sales are the same
as the previous two scenarios, so

80
00:06:42.286 --> 00:06:44.351
we will simply click OK here.

81
00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.837
In the Scenario Values window,

82
00:06:48.837 --> 00:06:53.970
we can update the values of
the changing sales for this scenario.

83
00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:58.778
And in this alternative feature,
sales have dropped to 3%.

84
00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:04.065
Growth Margin is lowered to 32%.

85
00:07:05.936 --> 00:07:11.030
And SG&A Expenses as a percentage
of ticket revenue is not impacted.

86
00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:13.696
So we will keep this at 30%

87
00:07:16.138 --> 00:07:21.610
After the variable's values have
been updated for this scenario,

88
00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:25.738
click on OK to finish
creating the third scenario.

89
00:07:25.738 --> 00:07:30.655
Now, it's time to set up our
last scenario, click Add,

90
00:07:32.244 --> 00:07:37.394
And type in the name of our final
scenario, Exploding Market Growth.

91
00:07:43.288 --> 00:07:48.415
The last scenario is a little bit
different because we're considering

92
00:07:48.415 --> 00:07:53.629
an additional variable which is the 2%
year over year growth as a result

93
00:07:53.629 --> 00:07:58.428
of the overall industry market growth,
specified in cell K66.

94
00:08:00.259 --> 00:08:07.213
Therefore, in a changing cell field,
let's add cell K66 and click OK.

95
00:08:08.882 --> 00:08:14.885
Because revenue, margin, and expenses
stay the same as the original scenario,

96
00:08:14.885 --> 00:08:19.322
we will keep those numbers from
the Baseline scenario at 8%

97
00:08:19.322 --> 00:08:26.158
Revenue Growth Rate, 45% Growth Margin,

98
00:08:26.158 --> 00:08:33.325
and 30% SG&A Expense as
a percentage of ticket revenue.

99
00:08:33.325 --> 00:08:38.255
Our last field is for the year over
year growth rate, which we'll set to 2%.

100
00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:44.561
After the variable's values have
been updated for this scenario,

101
00:08:44.561 --> 00:08:48.320
click OK to complete our fourth and
final scenario.

102
00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:50.372
Now that everything's set up,

103
00:08:50.372 --> 00:08:53.948
there are two ways to view
the result of your scenarios.

104
00:08:53.948 --> 00:08:58.050
The first way is to show
the result one scenario at a time.

105
00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:03.590
To do that, simply click on the scenario
name in the Scenario Manager window,

106
00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:05.760
then click Show.

107
00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:12.340
As you can see, the projective portion of
the income statement, which is dependent

108
00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:17.810
on a variables that we have specified
in our scenario, has just updated.

109
00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:21.500
We can toggle between the different
scenarios by simply clicking

110
00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:24.250
on another scenario name and
clicking Show.

111
00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:29.240
However, this view does not
allow you to easily compare and

112
00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:32.580
contrast the result of
all of your scenarios.

113
00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:36.950
In order to see the results of all
the scenarios at once, we can create

114
00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:42.560
a summary by clicking on Summary on the
right side of the Scenario Manager window.

115
00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:46.610
For Report type,
choose Scenario Summary, and

116
00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:52.370
let's include Gross Profit, Operating
Income, Compound Annual Growth Rate,

117
00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:56.960
also known as CAGR, as the metrics to
view on the report for the period.

118
00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:04.140
One we click OK, the summary
will be generated on a new tab.

119
00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:08.335
As you can see, the Gross Profit,
Operating Income, and

120
00:10:08.335 --> 00:10:12.990
CAGR results from each of the four
scenarios are listed on this table view.

121
00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:18.510
On the left side,
there's an outline grouping tool.

122
00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:20.130
If we click on the minus sign,

123
00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:25.030
it will collapse the rows to only show
the bottom row in the same grouping.

124
00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:29.730
When you click on the plus sign,
everything will reappear.

125
00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:34.343
This allows you to view only the part of

126
00:10:34.343 --> 00:10:38.098
the summary that you're
most interested in.

127
00:10:38.098 --> 00:10:40.275
Now, it's turn to practice.

128
00:10:42.226 --> 00:10:48.469
