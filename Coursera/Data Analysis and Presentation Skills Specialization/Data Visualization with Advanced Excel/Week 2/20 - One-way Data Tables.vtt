00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:07.930
We are now going to cover how to use

2
00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:13.080
a data table to gather multiple outcomes
from a formula given a variable input.

3
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.750
After this demonstration,

4
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.690
you should be able to use a one way data
table to understand the range of outcomes.

5
00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:23.790
For a given range of a variable input.

6
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.290
To continue our story,

7
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.770
we're going to analyze the impact
of flight related costs.

8
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.340
The forecasting team is looking to get
a better understanding of how fuel and

9
00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.250
labor affect profitability in a proposed
new route from Chicago to Atlanta.

10
00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:45.010
The operations team has determined
the minimum cost per mile is $30, and

11
00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:50.770
the maximum cost per mile is $50,
depending on the various market factors.

12
00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.840
The operations team has
also provided estimates for

13
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.400
the number of passengers per flight and
the revenue per passenger.

14
00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.430
170 and 150 respectively.

15
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:08.530
We've summarized this information
in cells B113 through C120.

16
00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.870
Using the information provided
by the operations team,

17
00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:18.140
we've determined an estimated profit
per flight in cell C120, however,

18
00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.610
recall that we would like to analyze how
profit is impacted by cost per flight.

19
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.170
This table only calculates the profits for
one value of cost per mile at a time.

20
00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.430
However in reality, we are rarely
confident on an exact number for

21
00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.520
the input for one of our variables.

22
00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.930
This is where the data
table tool provides value,

23
00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.020
as it's going to allow us to fluctuate
the value of the cost per mile variable.

24
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.730
We've provided the structure of the data
table and cells, F113 through G124.

25
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:54.510
Now we'll demonstrate how to
use a one way data table to

26
00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.670
analyze the impact of
cost per mile on profit.

27
00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.460
First, we need to link our
objective formula located in cell

28
00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.300
C120 to the data table.

29
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.468
Select G113 and type the equal sign.

30
00:02:09.468 --> 00:02:19.106
Then select C120 Next,

31
00:02:19.106 --> 00:02:24.350
notice the range of values
in cells F114 through F124.

32
00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:30.240
Each cell in this range represents
a particular value of our variable,

33
00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.580
cost per mile,
which is located in cell C117.

34
00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.810
When the data table is complete, for
each value in cost per mile range,

35
00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.390
we'll have an outcome for
a formula cell C120.

36
00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.900
Let's build the data table.

37
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:53.692
Using your mouse,
select cells F113, through G124.

38
00:02:56.248 --> 00:02:59.382
Navigate to the data tab in the ribbon,
and

39
00:02:59.382 --> 00:03:03.572
selected data table from
the what if analysis drop down.

40
00:03:06.518 --> 00:03:13.110
We now are presented with two options,
row input cell and column input cell.

41
00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.960
In this case, we have
a column-oriented one way data table,

42
00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.100
because our range of values
is located in a column.

43
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.578
Our variable input is cost per mile, so

44
00:03:25.578 --> 00:03:31.490
using the reference box select
cell C117 and click okay.

45
00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.613
Each value in cells
G114 to G124 represents

46
00:03:37.613 --> 00:03:41.754
the outcome of the formula in cells C120,
for

47
00:03:41.754 --> 00:03:46.210
each respective value
in cells F114 to G124.

48
00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:54.461
Notice that when cost per mile is $50,
profit falls to $0.

49
00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.170
We've now demonstrated how
to use a one way data table,

50
00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.860
to determine the range of
outcomes given a variable input.

51
00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.310
In this case, cost per mile.

52
00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:10.980
Now it's your turn to practice one way
data tables in the student workbook.

53
00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.915
In the next video,

54
00:04:13.915 --> 00:04:20.703
we'll demonstrate how to very two inputs,

55
00:04:20.703 --> 00:04:25.294
using two-way data tables.

56
00:04:25.294 --> 00:04:29.629
