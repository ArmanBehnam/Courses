1
00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.385
To demonstrate how
Goal Seek can be used,

2
00:00:08.385 --> 00:00:11.070
let's look at a real-world
example together.

3
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.780
An airline company you're working

4
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.460
for is considering expanding

5
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.555
their portfolio by adding
Atlanta as a new destination.

6
00:00:18.555 --> 00:00:21.300
This would require an
initial investment of

7
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.100
$250,000 to secure capacity
at the Atlanta airport.

8
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.125
Your market research team

9
00:00:28.125 --> 00:00:30.350
estimates that the
additional raul would

10
00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:34.890
generate $100,000 and
incremental profit in Year 1,

11
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.200
and an additional 50,000 in

12
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.805
profit during Years 2 through 5.

13
00:00:39.805 --> 00:00:41.720
In order to determine whether or

14
00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.180
not this is a
worthwhile investment,

15
00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.790
let's look into net
present value or

16
00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.275
NPV and internal rate
of return or IRR.

17
00:00:51.275 --> 00:00:53.870
NPV accounts for
the time value of

18
00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.630
money and calculates how
much the returns are

19
00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.120
worth in today's
terms if you were

20
00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.600
to receive that in a
future time period.

21
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.080
In simple terms, NPV is

22
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.790
how much a dollar given to you in

23
00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.195
five years is worth today.

24
00:01:10.195 --> 00:01:12.860
NPV also includes any costs

25
00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.170
associated with the investment.

26
00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.555
IRR on the other hand,

27
00:01:17.555 --> 00:01:20.660
looks at the same problem
from a different angle.

28
00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.850
IRR seeks to find

29
00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.820
the interest rate that sets
the NPV equation to zero.

30
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.750
In summary, NPV can be viewed as

31
00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.095
the profitability of a
project in absolute terms,

32
00:01:33.095 --> 00:01:35.720
where IRR is the profitability of

33
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.700
a project in relative
terms or percentage.

34
00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.010
Now that we understand
what we're trying to find,

35
00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.260
let's get back to
the problem at hand.

36
00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.990
Based on the financial
outlays table,

37
00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.390
we can calculate NPV and
the IRR in two ways.

38
00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.200
First we'll use the NPV
formula before showing how

39
00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.880
the Goal Seek can
help us arrive at

40
00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.480
the same answer but much
faster and more precisely.

41
00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.980
First, we'll set up a
formula for NPV in Excel,

42
00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.860
which is dependent on the
value of our discount rate.

43
00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.735
Let's type in the formula.

44
00:02:10.735 --> 00:02:12.940
As a reminder from Course 2,

45
00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.250
the syntax for NPV is

46
00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.960
the discount rate followed

47
00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.150
by the cash flow
starting at Year 1,

48
00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.755
which equals NPV,
open parenthesis,

49
00:02:23.755 --> 00:02:29.195
our discount rate H28 comma.

50
00:02:29.195 --> 00:02:37.745
Then our outlays range so B27
through rows B31 plus B26.

51
00:02:37.745 --> 00:02:40.415
We subtracted the Year 0 outlay

52
00:02:40.415 --> 00:02:42.590
or the initial investment after

53
00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.330
the NPV formula to

54
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.280
take the investment
into account without

55
00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.930
discounting it as it is

56
00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.615
assumed the cash
outlay is made today.

57
00:02:50.615 --> 00:02:52.220
As you can see here,

58
00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.830
if the discount
rate is 10 percent,

59
00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:01.520
the NPV is $472,168.75.

60
00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.965
To calculate what discount rate

61
00:03:03.965 --> 00:03:06.290
will force NPV to equal zero,

62
00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.285
we also have a few options.

63
00:03:08.285 --> 00:03:11.630
The brute force way is to
use trial and error with

64
00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.370
the input value and see when

65
00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.790
you're getting close
to the desired answer.

66
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.405
We can try it with a few values;

67
00:03:18.405 --> 00:03:23.760
25 percent, 35 percent,
and 55 percent.

68
00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.215
Notice as the discount
rate becomes larger,

69
00:03:27.215 --> 00:03:30.920
NPV is getting closer
and closer to zero.

70
00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.355
So we can be sure that the IRR

71
00:03:34.355 --> 00:03:38.105
is close to 56 percent
based on what we've seen.

72
00:03:38.105 --> 00:03:40.070
However, if you want to save

73
00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.020
the time and skip
straight to the results,

74
00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.630
Goal Seek is a perfect tool.

75
00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.090
In order to quickly
determine what

76
00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.540
the internal rate of return
is or in other words,

77
00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.920
what discount rate will
make the NPV equation zero,

78
00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.500
let's navigate to the data tab.

79
00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.010
Find What If Analysis

80
00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.025
and select Goal Seek
from the drop down.

81
00:04:03.025 --> 00:04:04.570
In the pop-up window,

82
00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.195
you will see that there are
three input parameters;

83
00:04:07.195 --> 00:04:10.180
set cell, to value,

84
00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.665
and by changing cell.

85
00:04:12.665 --> 00:04:14.920
Set cell is where we specify

86
00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.635
which cell is the outcome
we're trying to monitor.

87
00:04:17.635 --> 00:04:20.095
In our case, it is the NPV.

88
00:04:20.095 --> 00:04:22.315
In the two value field,

89
00:04:22.315 --> 00:04:25.240
type in the value of the
desired outcome which in

90
00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.780
our case we want the NPV
to be equal to zero.

91
00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.860
Finally, the by changing
cell field is where we can

92
00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.930
specify which variable
we would like

93
00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.430
to manipulate to get
the result we want,

94
00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.315
which in this case
translates to the IRR.

95
00:04:41.315 --> 00:04:44.585
After all three parameters
are filled out,

96
00:04:44.585 --> 00:04:46.415
let's click on Okay.

97
00:04:46.415 --> 00:04:48.620
Excel will then
automatically cycle

98
00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:49.940
through the different values of

99
00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.665
an IRR to make the
NPV equal to zero.

100
00:04:53.665 --> 00:04:58.955
The final answer Goal Seek
came up with is 56.72 percent.

101
00:04:58.955 --> 00:05:03.110
In other words, if the discount
rate is 56.72 percent,

102
00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.315
the net present value or NPV

103
00:05:05.315 --> 00:05:07.790
of the investment will
be equal to zero.

104
00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:10.295
Now, let's double
check our answers.

105
00:05:10.295 --> 00:05:12.320
Luckily for us, Excel already

106
00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.510
has a built-in formula
specifically for

107
00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:16.700
calculating IRR as long as

108
00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.580
you have the financial
outlay of the investment.

109
00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.900
So H30 let's type
in the IRR formula.

110
00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:33.350
Equals IRR open parenthesis
then B26 through cells B31.

111
00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:36.170
This refers to the same
financial outlay table

112
00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:39.870
that we used earlier to build
out our Goal Seek tool.

113
00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.300
As you can see, the
formula returns 56.72

114
00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.580
percent which is
exactly the same result

115
00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.680
that the Goal Seek
tool has arrived at.

116
00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.560
Now you can see Goal Seek
allows you to experiment

117
00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.860
with an input variable
to get a desired answer.

118
00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:58.340
We use this all the time to
help define our scenarios.

119
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.170
For example, Goal Seek is

120
00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:03.020
a perfect tool to determine
what the price of electricity

121
00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:04.460
needs to be to make

122
00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:05.990
a natural gas power plant

123
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.315
profitable at
different gas prices.

124
00:06:08.315 --> 00:06:12.415
To summarize, Goal Seek is
located under the data tab

125
00:06:12.415 --> 00:06:14.940
under What If Analysis and then

126
00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.605
you'll see Goal Seek
in the drop down.

127
00:06:17.605 --> 00:06:19.280
In order to use Goal Seek,

128
00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:20.930
there needs to be
a formula linking

129
00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:23.525
the cell you are changing
to the end results.

130
00:06:23.525 --> 00:06:26.390
As long as you have established
an Excel formula or

131
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:28.550
a mathematical equation to define

132
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:31.280
how the variable and
the result are related,

133
00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.900
Goal Seek can help you take

134
00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.300
the guesswork out of your
calculation by quickly

135
00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.130
finding what variable value you

136
00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:39.565
need to achieve the end
results results you want.

137
00:06:39.565 --> 00:06:43.060
Now, it's your turn to practice.
