2
00:00:11.021 --> 00:00:11.887
Welcome back.

3
00:00:11.887 --> 00:00:13.705
You're halfway through this course.

4
00:00:13.705 --> 00:00:16.821
This week you've heard some of my
colleagues explore three types of

5
00:00:16.821 --> 00:00:20.060
analytical methods for
answering questions using data.

6
00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.491
Scenario analysis,
sensitivity analysis and simulations.

7
00:00:24.491 --> 00:00:27.400
We started the week by
looking at scenario analysis

8
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.510
which helps us formulize possible
answers to questions about the future.

9
00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.010
And we saw how we can capture and
quantify outcomes by using a definition

10
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.710
of a specific state and the related
impact on variables being analysed.

11
00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.180
I personally have used scenario analysis
on a variety of client projects.

12
00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.870
Because the need for

13
00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.890
understanding the impact of various what
if situations is extremely valuable.

14
00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.750
We then looked at sensitivity analysis.

15
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.130
We saw that it can be used to
determine how projected performance

16
00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:00.340
is affected by changes in the assumptions
upon which those projections are based.

17
00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.100
We finished the week
learning about simulations.

18
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.270
We saw how simulation involves iterating
through possible values of one, or more,

19
00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:08.770
variables of a model.

20
00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.030
In order to capture possible and
ultimately likely outcomes.

21
00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.230
I hope you gained insight from
the various analytical methods and

22
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:17.280
have an appreciation for

23
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.930
understanding a problem before you
determine which method to use.

24
00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.640
Always ask yourself who
your audience is and

25
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.750
what you're trying to achieve
before choosing a starting point.

26
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.510
We hope you enjoyed this week.

27
00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.909
I'll be back next week to get you started.

28
