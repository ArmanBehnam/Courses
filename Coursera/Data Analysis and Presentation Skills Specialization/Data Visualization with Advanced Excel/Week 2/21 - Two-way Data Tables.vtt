2
00:00:05.317 --> 00:00:08.711
Building upon the example
of the one-way data table,

3
00:00:08.711 --> 00:00:11.510
let's add an additional variable.

4
00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:13.803
The number of passengers per flight.

5
00:00:13.803 --> 00:00:16.708
We were working to understand
profitability, and for

6
00:00:16.708 --> 00:00:20.310
the one-way data table,
we assumed we knew the demand.

7
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.698
However, just like the fuel costs,
this variable we'd expect to vary.

8
00:00:24.698 --> 00:00:29.607
The operations team has analyzed
historical demand and determined that

9
00:00:29.607 --> 00:00:36.460
the minimum demand is 150 passengers, and
the maximum demand is 200 passengers.

10
00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.685
Now we'll analyze how profit changes
when we have two variable inputs,

11
00:00:40.685 --> 00:00:45.650
demand, passengers, and
costs, cost per mile.

12
00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.556
For total revenue, we multiply the number
of passengers by revenue per passenger,

13
00:00:52.556 --> 00:00:55.993
which is $150.

14
00:00:55.993 --> 00:01:00.100
The two-way data table requires
a slightly different set up.

15
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.030
So now the objective profit per flight

16
00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:09.020
must be placed directly above
the column input variable, fuel cost.

17
00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.708
Again, we've provided the structure
of the data table, this time in cells

18
00:01:13.708 --> 00:01:19.380
F142 through L153.

19
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.840
Similar to our one-way data table,
we've provided the required input and

20
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.040
the objective formula in
the input parameters table.

21
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.672
The inputs we are going to vary
are passengers in cell C143,

22
00:01:33.672 --> 00:01:37.470
and cost per mile in cell C146.

23
00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:44.084
The objective formula,
profit per flight, is in cell C149.

24
00:01:44.084 --> 00:01:47.487
We've supplied a range of values for

25
00:01:47.487 --> 00:01:52.003
cost per mile in cells F143 through F153.

26
00:01:52.003 --> 00:01:57.705
Now, since we have a two-way data table,
we have a second range of values,

27
00:01:57.705 --> 00:02:01.460
passengers, in cells G142 through L142.

28
00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.440
Let's begin building our data table.

29
00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.920
First we need to link
our objective formula.

30
00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.180
This setup is slightly different than
the one-way data table from before.

31
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.230
In the other one-way data table
we placed the link directly above

32
00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.838
the range of outcomes.

33
00:02:19.838 --> 00:02:26.597
For a two-way data table, we place
the link above the column inputs and

34
00:02:26.597 --> 00:02:30.439
adjacent to the row input cell F142.

35
00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:34.919
Select cell F142 and
type the equals sign and

36
00:02:34.919 --> 00:02:39.294
link to the output cell C149 and
hit Enter.

37
00:02:41.618 --> 00:02:48.190
Next using your mouse highlight
cells F142 through L153.

38
00:02:51.238 --> 00:02:54.935
Navigate to the Data tab in the ribbon and

39
00:02:54.935 --> 00:02:59.951
select Data Table from
the What If Analysis drop down.

40
00:03:02.177 --> 00:03:06.030
Our column variable
input is cost per mile.

41
00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.040
So using the reference box,
select cell and hit Enter.

42
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.978
Using the reference box for row input
cell, select C143 and hit Enter, and

43
00:03:17.978 --> 00:03:22.860
then click OK.

44
00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.770
Each value returned in the data table
corresponds to the profit per flight

45
00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:32.570
given the two variables we
are letting vary, cost and revenue.

46
00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:38.208
For example, the value of cell
I148 is profit per flight

47
00:03:38.208 --> 00:03:43.518
with 170 passengers, and
a cost of $40 per mile.

48
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:51.838
This provides a succinct method to display
a formula with multiple values for

49
00:03:51.838 --> 00:03:53.620
two different inputs.

50
00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:58.420
We've now demonstrated how
to use a two-way data table

51
00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.010
to determine the range of outcomes.

52
00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.090
Under two variables,
cost per mile and passengers.

53
00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:06.930
Now it's your turn to practice.

54
00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.051
Please use the student workbook.

55
00:04:10.051 --> 00:04:16.388
