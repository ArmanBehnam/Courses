[MUSIC]

2
00:00:05.911 --> 00:00:06.984
In this exercise,

3
00:00:06.984 --> 00:00:11.450
we're going to cover decision optimization
using the Excel Solver Add-in.

4
00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.270
Decision optimization is concerned with
choosing the best set of decisions

5
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:19.250
such that our objective is maximized or
minimized.

6
00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.620
The decisions are usually subject
to constraints such as budget or

7
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.780
available labor hours.

8
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:29.080
For example, we love to increase profits
by increasing marketing advertisements.

9
00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.640
However, in reality, we most likely have
a maximum amount of resources that we can

10
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.440
dedicate to marketing.

11
00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.340
So we're going to demonstrate how to
setup Excel to allow the Solver Add-in to

12
00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:40.979
optimize a set of decisions.

13
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.720
In the scenario below we've been
presented with five business initiatives

14
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.580
which come with an estimated total cost,
and a net benefit.

15
00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.060
In this case, we'd like to know which
initiatives to execute against,

16
00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.950
subject to a $25 million budget.

17
00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:02.123
In other words, our decision
variables are binary, yes or no.

18
00:01:02.123 --> 00:01:05.680
And we want to determine which
initiatives to say yes to.

19
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.880
To accomplish this task, we're going
to use Excel Solver, a free add-in.

20
00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.540
Solver requires a few inputs,

21
00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.020
such as the objective cell, the type of
optimization problem, and any constraints.

22
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.200
To increase profits,

23
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.700
we've identified five different
initiatives that we can implement.

24
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.043
The first initiative to
consider is adding a new route,

25
00:01:26.043 --> 00:01:29.537
which has an estimated
net benefit of $275,000.

26
00:01:31.034 --> 00:01:35.170
Next we're considering adding more
capacity to our existing set of routes.

27
00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.350
Which carries an estimated
net benefit of $2.9 million.

28
00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.050
Another option is to invest in
a new technology solution that is

29
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:48.735
estimated to bring a net
benefit of $825,000.

30
00:01:48.735 --> 00:01:51.535
The final two options under
consideration are increasing

31
00:01:51.535 --> 00:01:54.875
the size of the sales force,
and a process improvement plan.

32
00:01:54.875 --> 00:01:59.434
With estimated net benefit
figures of $2.8 million, and

33
00:01:59.434 --> 00:02:02.965
$1.2 million respectively.

34
00:02:02.965 --> 00:02:05.895
While we'd like to implement each
initiative because they all carry

35
00:02:05.895 --> 00:02:10.225
a positive net benefit, we're constrained
by our $25 million budget, and

36
00:02:10.225 --> 00:02:11.975
each initiative requires an investment.

37
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.103
In fact,
if we sum the cost of each initiative,

38
00:02:21.547 --> 00:02:25.380
The total investment exceeds $56 million,
twice our budget.

39
00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:33.240
In cells C293 through G293, we've included
the net benefit of each initiative.

40
00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.140
And the costs are in
cells C296 through G296.

41
00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.650
In our scenario, we want to maximize net
benefit while keeping total costs at or

42
00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:46.770
below $25 million.

43
00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.880
Excel Solver is an add-in that needs
to be enabled if it is not already.

44
00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.350
To check if it's enabled
navigate to the DATA tab and

45
00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.650
look for
the Solver icon in the Analysis section.

46
00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.840
If you see the icon then the add-in
is enabled and you can proceed.

47
00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.080
If not, navigate to the FILE tab and
click on the Options button from the menu.

48
00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.150
In the Excel Options window
select the Add-ins option.

49
00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.350
At the bottom of the window,
find the Manager drop-down, and

50
00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.510
with Excel Add-ins selected, click Go.

51
00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.340
This brings up the Add-ins window.

52
00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.000
Check the Solver Add-in box,
then click OK.

53
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.670
Verify the Solver icon is
visible on the DATA tab.

54
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.370
As a reminder,
want to maximize net benefit,

55
00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.170
subject to our $25 million budget.

56
00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.520
Returning to the problem,

57
00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:47.310
we've labeled cell I293 as the objective
cell, at the moment, this cell is empty.

58
00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.528
But we need it to be linked
to our decision variables in

59
00:03:51.528 --> 00:03:54.171
cells C292 through G292.

60
00:03:54.171 --> 00:03:58.725
The decision variables are binary, 1 if
we decide to pursue the initiative, and

61
00:03:58.725 --> 00:03:59.590
0 otherwise.

62
00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:06.631
In the objective cell, we need to sum the
net benefit if the corresponding decision

63
00:04:06.631 --> 00:04:10.452
variable is 1, and disregard it
if the decision variable is 0.

64
00:04:10.452 --> 00:04:15.006
One way to accomplish this is a SUMIF
formula, however this option will become

65
00:04:15.006 --> 00:04:18.810
less efficient if the decision
variables are not binary.

66
00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.961
As a result we will use SUMPRODUCT
because it can handle both binary and

67
00:04:23.961 --> 00:04:26.596
non-binary decision variables.

68
00:04:26.596 --> 00:04:29.809
The SUMPRODUCT formula multiplies
corresponding elements

69
00:04:29.809 --> 00:04:32.985
of equal length arrays,
then sums each product.

70
00:04:32.985 --> 00:04:37.105
For example, the first element of
the first array is multiplied by the first

71
00:04:37.105 --> 00:04:41.495
element of the second array, second
element by second element, third by third.

72
00:04:41.495 --> 00:04:44.005
Until each element of each
array has been accounted for.

73
00:04:45.075 --> 00:04:47.705
Then we sum the result of each product.

74
00:04:47.705 --> 00:04:51.363
Some viewers might recognize this
as the dot product of two vectors.

75
00:04:53.094 --> 00:04:59.530
In cell I293, type =SUMPRODUCT and
hit the Tab key.

76
00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.910
The first array will be
our decision variables.

77
00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:08.370
So select C292 through G292 and
type a comma.

78
00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:11.940
The next array is the net benefit range.

79
00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.010
Select cells C293 through G293.

80
00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:20.188
Close parentheses and hit Enter.

81
00:05:20.188 --> 00:05:24.420
Right now the formula returns 0 because
each decision variable is empty.

82
00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:33.702
To further demonstrate SUMPRODUCT, place
1 in cell C292, and observe the result.

83
00:05:35.893 --> 00:05:42.334
Now we have 1 multiplied by cell C293,
with all remaining products totaling 0.

84
00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:48.286
The goal is to get Solver to change
our decision variables between 1 and

85
00:05:48.286 --> 00:05:51.921
0 until we have the largest
possible number in cell I293,

86
00:05:51.921 --> 00:05:56.530
while keeping investment expenditures
at or below $25 million.

87
00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:04.970
The investment costs for each initiative
is located in the range C296 through G296.

88
00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:08.170
Similar to the objective cell,

89
00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:12.360
we need a way to link the total
investment cost to our decision cells.

90
00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.740
That is, if we choose to execute a plan,

91
00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.480
we add that plan's investment
costs to total costs.

92
00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:22.536
We'll use the SUMPRODUCT
again to accomplish this.

93
00:06:22.536 --> 00:06:31.600
In cell I296, Type =SUMPRODUCT and
press the Tab key.

94
00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:37.790
Similar to the objective cell, the first
array is the decision variable range.

95
00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:41.251
C292 through G292.

96
00:06:41.251 --> 00:06:43.564
So, select those cells with your mouse.

97
00:06:45.565 --> 00:06:51.445
Type a comma,
the second array is the total cost range,

98
00:06:51.445 --> 00:06:55.207
in cells C296 through G296.

99
00:06:55.207 --> 00:06:59.666
Once you've selected that array, finalize
the formula by closing the parenthesis and

100
00:06:59.666 --> 00:07:00.880
hitting the Enter key.

101
00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:05.644
Now, since we have a 1 in cell C292,

102
00:07:05.644 --> 00:07:11.463
the result of the formula should
be 1 times the number in C296.

103
00:07:11.463 --> 00:07:14.840
As the decision cells change,
the total cost will updated.

104
00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:20.640
We've configured the Excel spreadsheet to
update when the decision variables change

105
00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.010
using the SUMPRODUCT formula.

106
00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:26.890
Now, we need to setup Solver
to change the decision cells.

107
00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:30.183
In order to maximize the objective cell,

108
00:07:30.183 --> 00:07:34.804
while keeping cell I296 less than or
equal to K296.

109
00:07:34.804 --> 00:07:37.820
We're going to input all of these
information in the Solver window.

110
00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:43.460
To open the Solver window,
navigate to the DATA tab.

111
00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:45.820
And click the Solver button
in the Analysis section.

112
00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:49.340
The first input is Set Objective.

113
00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:54.140
This let's Solver know which
cell we want to optimize.

114
00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:59.793
Click the reference box and
select cell I293.

115
00:07:59.793 --> 00:08:04.110
Next is the to option which is
determined by the type of problem.

116
00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:06.320
We want to maximize net benefit, so

117
00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:09.440
click the option button Max,
if not already selected.

118
00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:14.770
Moving down the window we have the,
By Changing Variable Cells,

119
00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:16.490
cell reference box.

120
00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:19.230
This lets Solver know which cells
need to be changed until it

121
00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:21.190
finds the optimal solution.

122
00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:25.160
We want Solver to choose the initiatives
that should be executed to maximize

123
00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:26.310
net benefit.

124
00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:33.860
Which means choosing the best combinations
of 1's and 0's in cells C292 through G292.

125
00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:36.553
Click the cell reference box and

126
00:08:36.553 --> 00:08:41.850
select cells C292 through G292,
and hit the Enter key.

127
00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:46.910
We now turn to the constraints
section of the window.

128
00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:49.220
We're going to enter two constraints.

129
00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:53.910
First, our decision variables are binary,
so we need to let Solver know this.

130
00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:57.960
Second, we need to specify the total
cost cell that is calculated for

131
00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:01.390
a particular combination of 1's and 0's.

132
00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:03.228
This will be our left-hand side.

133
00:09:03.228 --> 00:09:07.534
The right-hand side of this constraint
is going to be our total budget,

134
00:09:07.534 --> 00:09:09.590
which is located in cell K296.

135
00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:13.660
To add the constraints,
click the Add button.

136
00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:18.723
We'll enter the binary constraints first,
so

137
00:09:18.723 --> 00:09:23.899
select the cells C292 through
G292 in the cell reference box.

138
00:09:27.766 --> 00:09:33.530
Then change the qualifier drop-down to
bin, which stands for binary, click Add.

139
00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:40.600
For the budget constraint,
click cell I296, then hit the Enter key.

140
00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:47.404
We need cell I296 to be less than or
equal to $25 million,

141
00:09:47.404 --> 00:09:50.927
which we've provided in cell K296.

142
00:09:50.927 --> 00:09:55.996
Make sure our qualifier is less than or
equal, for

143
00:09:55.996 --> 00:10:00.953
the constraint box select K296 and
click OK.

144
00:10:00.953 --> 00:10:06.368
The last option you configure is
the solving method, select Simplex LP.

145
00:10:06.368 --> 00:10:08.676
This is the algorithm
used to change the cells,

146
00:10:08.676 --> 00:10:12.149
but the details of the mechanics
are beyond the scope of this exercise.

147
00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:15.160
We're now ready to solve.

148
00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:18.860
Click Solve and Solver will find
the optimal solution that satisfies

149
00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:21.550
all constraints,
assuming there is a feasible solution.

150
00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:27.678
As you can see, the best possible solution
is to choose technology investment,

151
00:10:27.678 --> 00:10:31.123
adding more sales reps, and
the process improvement plan.

152
00:10:31.123 --> 00:10:34.320
The result of this is a net
benefit of $4.9 million.

153
00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:39.703
And the total investment
required is $23.4 million,

154
00:10:39.703 --> 00:10:44.256
which we require to be less
than our budget of $25 million.

155
00:10:44.256 --> 00:10:46.570
Why is this such a powerful tool?

156
00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:49.080
Couldn't we just change
the values of the cells manually

157
00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:51.070
until we get the best solution?

158
00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:54.650
Well, technically you can, but
this is a simple problem and

159
00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:59.360
you still have 32 different combinations
of initiatives to assess and compare.

160
00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:01.770
Imagine if we had more
variables to consider.

161
00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:04.930
For binary variables
each additional variable

162
00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:08.490
doubles the number of combinations
we'd have to consider.

163
00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:11.340
If the decision variables
are integers it becomes very

164
