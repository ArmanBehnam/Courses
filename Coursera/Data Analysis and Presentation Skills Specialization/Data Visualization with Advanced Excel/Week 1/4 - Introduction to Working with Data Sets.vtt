2
00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:15.754
During this first week, you are going to
learn about the development of databases

3
00:00:15.754 --> 00:00:18.040
and models.
Hello again, I'm Carey Banner.

4
00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.820
In course two of this specialization,

5
00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.600
we focused our analysis on data sets that
are contained within one table or group.

6
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.470
In everyday life, however,
we are typically more interested in

7
00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.400
how multiple data sets come together
to provide insights and tell a story.

8
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.580
This week you are going to learn
about the components of data sets and

9
00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:40.730
the relational database model,
database keys, relationships, and joins.

10
00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:41.550
By the end of the week,

11
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.210
you will have a working knowledge
of developing a data model.

12
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:46.830
In this segment,

13
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.480
I'm going to give you a quick
introduction to working with data sets.

14
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.700
As you start to work with data, you
need to understand three basic concepts.

15
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.840
First, what is a data set?

16
00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.440
Second, how can I combine data sets?

17
00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.370
Specifically where I have two sets of
data that share common attributes.

18
00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.710
And third, what is a database?

19
00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.520
So let's begin with the first question.

20
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.910
What is a data set and why is it useful?

21
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.080
A data set is a file that contains
data that has been collected or

22
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.740
is being collected live.

23
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:17.530
For example,

24
00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.120
an Excel file that tracks your credit card
purchases could be considered a data set.

25
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.820
Data sets are useful as they are a core
component of the data driven decision

26
00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:26.760
making process.

27
00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.824
Letâ€™s say a global warming theory
is based on data analytics.

28
00:01:31.824 --> 00:01:35.784
The sea levels continue to rise every
year, and having collected that data for

29
00:01:35.784 --> 00:01:38.974
years, scientists are able to
make inferences from the data.

30
00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.240
What if I have two data sets
that share common elements?

31
00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.970
Can I combine them?

32
00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.440
In course two of this specialization
we use the VLookup function to look up

33
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.305
values from one table to
combine it with another.

34
00:01:52.305 --> 00:01:56.290
VLookups up to work because there
are matching values between two tables.

35
00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.600
Those pieces of data
are linked by that value.

36
00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.900
And finally, what is a database?

37
00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.550
A database is a collection of data sets
that are linked together through various

38
00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.010
relationships.

39
00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.740
We find databases and
data models throughout the business world.

40
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.350
Databases comprise core data
infrastructure that supports the modern

41
00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:15.620
business.

42
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.690
Today, we find everything is tracked and
stored.

43
00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.430
This can range from financial data
to how many times the door on

44
00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.220
floor 12 was unlocked by a given employee.

45
00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.250
All of this information
needs to be stored and

46
00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.250
linked to other data
sets using relationships.

47
00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.120
For the example previously mentioned,

48
00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.690
you may be linking the door unlock data
set to the employee security data set,

49
00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.400
which may be linked to the individual
employee ID at the company.

50
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:46.530
Now that you have an understanding of
why these key concepts are important,

51
00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.703
we'll take a deeper dive into
the academic building blocks that

52
00:02:51.703 --> 00:02:57.479
will ultimately allow you to implement
basic data modeling concepts.

53
00:02:57.479 --> 00:03:01.651
