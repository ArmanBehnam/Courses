2
00:00:11.157 --> 00:00:15.126
One of the most common types of databases
you will come across is a rational

3
00:00:15.126 --> 00:00:15.773
database.

4
00:00:15.773 --> 00:00:18.928
In this video I'm going to talk about
what a relational database is, and

5
00:00:18.928 --> 00:00:21.010
why you would want to use
this type of database.

6
00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:24.570
So, what is a relational database?

7
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.420
A relational database is a database
structured to recognize relationships

8
00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.910
among stored items of information.

9
00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.250
This type of database will have data sets
that are linked through relationships

10
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.630
stored within the data model.

11
00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:43.110
MySQL, Oracle and SQL Server are all
examples of relational database software.

12
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.230
A relational database can also
be any file that has data in it.

13
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.140
The next big question is,

14
00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.560
why would someone be interested
in using a relational database?

15
00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.130
Today's organizations all have
access to huge amounts of data.

16
00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.590
And the amount of information collected
on a daily basis continues to grow.

17
00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.760
Saving data provides organizations,
the ability to automate their tasks and

18
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:06.870
improve decision making.

19
00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.020
Organizations use data to make decisions
based on quantitative analysis

20
00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.920
instead of a gut feel.

21
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.910
This can lead to better decisions, but
it is also the keystone for automation.

22
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.602
Often times related data is
stored in different data sets.

23
00:01:22.602 --> 00:01:27.530
For example, one data set may store a
customer's name, phone number and address.

24
00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.700
While another might store the transactions
made by that same customer.

25
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.110
In real business environments,

26
00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.660
many different data sets are needed to
be combined to drive business insights.

27
00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.480
For example, business analytics can be

28
00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.000
used on customer data to predict
future purchasing behaviors.

29
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.790
Or analyzing inventory trends can lead
to automated ordering algorithms.

30
00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.080
Given how important databases are in
today's business environment,

31
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.230
it is crucial to understand how
data is stored in these databases.

32
00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.449
The concept of a data model
is key to understanding this.

33
00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.000
Let's take a look at data models.

34
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.640
What is a data model?

35
00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.210
And how might a data model
function within a database?

36
00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:12.670
A data model will tell us what data can
be stored, where it can be stored, and

37
00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.450
how to store the data.

38
00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.090
It will also prevent bad data
from entering the database.

39
00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.050
A data model states the rules under
which the database will operate.

40
00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.000
Other places where you might have
heard of a data model is in XML.

41
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.110
XML uses a hierarchical data model,

42
00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.140
which means that data is stored in such
a manner that it looks like a tree.

43
00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.770
Every tree has branches.

44
00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.080
And every branch has leaves.

45
00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.390
Relational data bases use
a relational data model.

46
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.960
This means that the data is stored in
rows rather than in tree like structures.

47
00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.730
Finally, why is relational
data useful in today's world?

48
00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.380
Relational data allows for
tables to connect and share data.

49
00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.700
Using this model, duplicate data will
not be collected because data is

50
00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.870
typically only stored once
in a relational model.

51
00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.330
You can relate one row of data
to many other rows of data.

52
00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.900
In other models, that one row of data
will have to be repeated many times.

53
00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.383
This matters when a database becomes
large because maintaining it will be more

54
00:03:10.383 --> 00:03:11.930
difficult.

55
00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.410
Relational databases strive to
keep the database size smaller and

56
00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.570
prevent duplicate rows of data.

57
00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.470
In this video I gave you a high level
overview of relational databases and

58
00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:22.300
why would use them.

59
00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.740
In the next video, my colleague is going
to give you an introduction to more

60
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.110
concepts related to relational databases.

61
00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.710
Before you get into the practical
portion of this week,

62
00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:35.560
where you'll learn how to import and
prepare data using Power Pivot.

63
00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.645
Link data tables to build
a relational model, and

64
00:03:38.645 --> 00:03:41.374
finally use Power Pivot to visualize data.

65
00:03:41.374 --> 00:03:47.727
