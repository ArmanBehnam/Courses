00:00:11.241 --> 00:00:15.311
Hi, I'm Amy Peirce and at PWC, I'm lucky
to enough to use advanced data and

3
00:00:15.311 --> 00:00:18.250
analytics to bring insights
to our clients everyday.

4
00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.970
In this video, we're going to
talk about data visualization.

5
00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.450
Data and analytics is all about
bringing client challenges to life so

6
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.730
we can overcome them by taking data,
whether structured, or unstructured, and

7
00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.180
turning it into usable information and
insights.

8
00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.310
All the sophisticated data and
analytics in the world won't matter,

9
00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.680
if it can't be consumed by an end user or
a decision maker.

10
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.490
Think about the data and

11
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:45.070
analytics framework that we talked
about earlier in the course.

12
00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.040
Once you gather the data and perform your
analysis, you need to be able to present

13
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.100
that data in a way that makes
sense to your end user.

14
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.560
In other words,
you have to visualize the data.

15
00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.219
Let's start with the basic
principle of data visualization.

16
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.420
Take a look at the table on the screen.

17
00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.120
How many numbers are greater then one?

18
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.750
Do you have it?

19
00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.070
Now tell me how many numbers
are greater then one.

20
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.660
Visualization doesn't have to be complex.

21
00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.480
In fact, visualization is all about
making complex insights simple.

22
00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.170
Simply highlighting the numbers
greater then one helped you solve

23
00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:22.560
the problem quickly.

24
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.370
And that's data
visualization in a nutshell.

25
00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.940
The presentation of data in a pictorial or
graphical format.

26
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.490
We illustrate data with graphics and
communicate information clearly and

27
00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.120
effectively to users.

28
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.590
It's nothing new.

29
00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.610
For centuries, people have depended on
visual representations such as charts,

30
00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.550
and maps, to understand information
more easily and quickly.

31
00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.010
As more and more data is collected and

32
00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.920
analyzed, decision makers at all levels
of the organization welcome data

33
00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:56.430
visualization software the enables them to
see analytical results presented visually.

34
00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.040
It helps them to find relevance
among millions of variables,

35
00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.500
communicate concepts and hypotheses to
others and even predict the future.

36
00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:12.240
Visualization is important because the
brain processes visual information faster.

37
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.680
Users can spot patterns or trends which
are not obvious in a flat structure.

38
00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.999
Information can be
interpreted by any audience.

39
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.710
Decision making is faster and cheaper.

40
00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.980
Simply put data visualization is just
a technique that helps everyone see and

41
00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.410
understand the analysis that is going on.

42
00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:31.270
For example,

43
00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.330
let's take you on a look through customer
behaviors based on their location.

44
00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.340
You would have to go through tables and

45
00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.730
tables of customers segments to identify
different behaviors by zip codes.

46
00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.500
It would take a lot of time to sort
through all that analysis and data.

47
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.260
If you plot that data on a map and
pinpoint stores or

48
00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.460
locations where specific customer behaviors
are occurring, you can use this to

49
00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:56.260
develop strategies that attracts specific
customers to specific locations.

50
00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.280
You can now take that map into a meeting
with your client and show him or

51
00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.590
her where all their stories are overlaid
with the data on their customers.

52
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.220
And you're able to tell a story that
will allow your client to adjust their

53
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.090
business strategy.

54
00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:12.200
Or seeing the data and

55
00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.300
analytics today is under pinning
every kind of business challenge.

56
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.927
Being able to visualize data allows
you to present an analysis so

57
00:03:19.927 --> 00:03:22.959
that anyone can understand
what the information means.

58
00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:29.595
