2
00:00:10.673 --> 00:00:14.708
Hello, I'm Carey Banner, and I support
a broad range of clients with financial

3
00:00:14.708 --> 00:00:17.749
inquires, compliance needs,
and fraud investigations.

4
00:00:17.749 --> 00:00:21.432
I help my clients understand where
their risks for fraud, waste, and

5
00:00:21.432 --> 00:00:24.929
abuse exist and use data analytics
to gather facts to help them make

6
00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:28.370
informed decisions on
mitigating these risks.

7
00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:32.330
In course two, we introduce you some
foundational building blocks of Excel,

8
00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:33.940
including the current concepts and

9
00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.170
the guiding principles that should
be kept in mind when using Excel.

10
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.690
These concepts and
principles do not only apply to Excel, but

11
00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.920
can be looked at as core rules
to help with all data analytics.

12
00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.690
It doesn't matter if you use another
tool like Azure, MATLAB, AWS, Vertica,

13
00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.030
or Aster.

14
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.110
We're going to begin this course by
reviewing these principles again.

15
00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.650
But this time, I'll focus more
on data analytics, in general.

16
00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.080
Let's start by reviewing
the five concepts.

17
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.100
The first is simplicity.

18
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.240
People don't always associate data
analytics with simplicity, and

19
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:09.170
the challenges we're often faced
with can seem complex and difficult.

20
00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.440
However, we should strive in our
work to reduce that complexity.

21
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.460
If you think about it, the science of data
analytics is just taking a large data set,

22
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.450
and simplifying it into something
we can use to make a decision.

23
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.670
As we limit complexity, we make our
work easier for others to follow.

24
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.330
And most importantly,
limit the opportunities for mistakes.

25
00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.640
The second is traceability.

26
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.580
Someone else should be able to
pick up your model or analysis and

27
00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.890
understand the story
you're trying to tell.

28
00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.550
It should be evident more data is
coming from, how it's being used, and

29
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.060
where it is going.

30
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.330
The third is consistency.

31
00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.010
I like to think about this in two ways,
consistency in formatting and

32
00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.800
visual layout,
as well as consistency in calculation.

33
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.040
The fourth is adaptability.

34
00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.570
The world is full of surprises.

35
00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.290
And quite often, we don't know exactly
where our analysis is going to take us, or

36
00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.130
how the requirements of
our model might change.

37
00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.390
Since change is inevitable, I develop
everything I do with adaptability in mind,

38
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.270
so I can quickly rearrange and
repurpose my work

39
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.090
without having to go back to the drawing
board for every new project.

40
00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.878
The last concept is ease of use.

41
00:02:14.878 --> 00:02:16.920
By creating well-thought-out and

42
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.950
documented models, you facilitate how
your tools will be used, and allow for

43
00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.029
transfer of ownership without the need for
a steep learning curve.

44
00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.090
To help us achieve these concepts and

45
00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.280
overall elegant simplicity,
we have a set of guiding principles.

46
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.060
I will touch on them briefly here,
but there is a reading assignment

47
00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.600
available in your course materials
that gives greater detail.

48
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.130
For now, here's a quick overview.

49
00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:41.360
Principle 1,

50
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.400
remember that your work is a deliverable
used to communicate your findings.

51
00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.600
I call it being client ready.

52
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.600
Your work may be used by
someone else down the road, or

53
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.310
you may need to reacquaint yourself
with the analysis down the line.

54
00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.566
Headers, footers, and a clean layout can
not only help you organize your thought

55
00:02:58.566 --> 00:03:00.736
process, but really elevate your work.

56
00:03:00.736 --> 00:03:03.673
Second, begin with the end in mind.

57
00:03:03.673 --> 00:03:06.223
The few minutes you take in
outlining your analysis and

58
00:03:06.223 --> 00:03:09.450
creating a storyboard can greatly
enhance your work and its impact.

59
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.820
Third, start with a template.

60
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.920
Rarely am I doing something that is so
different from anything I have ever

61
00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.130
done before, that I can't bring forward
lessons that I've learned in the past.

62
00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.450
I like to find a starting
point using something I or

63
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.620
a colleague have developed previously.

64
00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.510
This can help us avoid some of
the repetitive set up work,

65
00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.520
while also benefiting
from lessons learned, and

66
00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.000
critical thinking that
has already been done.

67
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.368
Fourth, separate the data.

68
00:03:34.368 --> 00:03:39.110
Each data set you work with should live
independently from non associated data.

69
00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.990
Throughout this course,

70
00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:42.950
we will learn techniques to help bridge
relationships between your data,

71
00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.970
and extract the relevant attributes
we need for our analytics.

72
00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.850
Number five,
limit hard coding as much as possible.

73
00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.950
Avoid using hard numbers in your analysis,
and instead, define a variable and

74
00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.540
then reference that variable when needed.

75
00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.730
This helps to enable consistent
assumptions across your work, and

76
00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.950
makes it much more flexible and
easier to update.

77
00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.640
Number six, for large, complex formulas,
think about breaking it down.

78
00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.690
In course two, we learned a lot of
interesting Excel formulas, and

79
00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:15.080
showed you how to combine them for
limitless possibilities.

80
00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.840
As we move on to more advanced tools,
the opportunity for

81
00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.500
complexity only continues to grow.

82
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.180
We could try to write one long formula,
or piece of code, but generally,

83
00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.300
it's better to break it down
to its individual components.

84
00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.200
Not only will it be easier to update and
transfer, but

85
00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.880
it limits errors and helps someone
follow the story of your data.

86
00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.800
Number seven, once your work is done,
do a thorough review.

87
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.490
When I receive or finish a draft of any
model, I always assume there are mistakes.

88
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:43.990
Thorough reviews are essential.

89
00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.180
But I also look to build
in error checks and

90
00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.580
other validation techniques
to let the data check itself,

91
00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.588
by calculating the results in two ways
to verify that they come out aligned.

92
00:04:53.588 --> 00:04:57.330
Principle 8, ask for help or look online.

93
00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.060
If you find something that is
taking too long to complete,

94
00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.750
chances are that someone has run
into the same problem before.

95
00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.680
Leverage your network, or
search for that online.

96
00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.980
There is likely a blog or a video out
there that will help you quickly figure

97
00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:13.860
out the syntax for a formula, or
help you construct your analysis.

98
00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.300
Finally, our ninth principle,
use the keyboard.

99
00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.060
We'd like to encourage our analyst to
use as many shortcuts as possible.

100
00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.860
There are dozens of keyboard shortcuts,
and taking the time to learn them now will

101
00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:28.010
dramatically reduce the time it takes for
you to do your work.

102
00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:32.200
Don't start by memorizing random
shortcuts, but learn to make a language.

103
00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.320
If you start finding yourself using
your similar command, stop and

104
00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.770
learn the shortcut, and
add it on your technical vocabulary.

105
00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:42.410
We'll share some of the shortcuts and
the materials for this course.

106
00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:44.930
That was a high level
over view the principles.

107
00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:48.325
But you're going to see all of it again
in detail and the reading assignment.

108
00:05:48.325 --> 00:05:51.750
Make sure you take the time to
read through the information.

109
00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:55.260
You may find it helpful to download
the reading for future reference.

110
00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.220
So that's our introduction to some
basic concepts to keep in mind,

111
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.750
as you learn about, and
begin to work with Excel, or

112
00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:03.350
any tool that is required
to complete your work.

113
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:06.490
I'll be back at the beginning of
each week to help you get started.

114
00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:09.543
I'll then hand to you off to one of my
colleagues, who will give you detailed

115
00:06:09.543 --> 00:06:12.084
instructions, and
chance to practice what you've learned.

116
00:06:12.084 --> 00:06:14.195
Thanks for joining us.

117
