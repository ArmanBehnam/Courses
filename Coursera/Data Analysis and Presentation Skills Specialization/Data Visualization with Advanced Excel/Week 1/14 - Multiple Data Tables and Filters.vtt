00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:07.355
[SOUND]
In this exercise,

2
00:00:07.355 --> 00:00:11.589
the COO of the airline would like us to
provide deeper insights into the routes

3
00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:14.150
being flown by the various flights.

4
00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.930
Specifically around amount of revenue and
fairs that are being brought in.

5
00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.470
Along with identifying trends regarding
the most popular months to fly.

6
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:27.230
Let's start with question 4A where we're
being asked to determine the number of

7
00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.380
flights from Chicago's O'Hare Airport
to Los Angeles International Airport.

8
00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.930
In order to perform this analysis,
we're going to need to combine data from

9
00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.270
the routes table that has a departure and
arrival airport information.

10
00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.380
With data from the flights table that
has the number of flights flown.

11
00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.840
We already linked our data tables
together in the first exercise.

12
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.580
So we can jump into creating
the PivotTable straight away.

13
00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.400
Just like before, we're going to put
the PivotTables in a separate tab for

14
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.740
each answer.

15
00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.830
So let's go ahead and
navigate to the tab named Pivot 4a.

16
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.776
In order to insert our PivotTable,
we're going to go to the Powerpivot

17
00:01:04.776 --> 00:01:09.050
tab And select Pivot Table.

18
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.090
We want to insert the pivot on this tab.

19
00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.400
So let's select existing worksheet and
then we are going to click on OK.

20
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.230
We're looking for
the number of flights on a specific route.

21
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:26.811
So we're going to count the FlightIDs
from the flights PivotTable since each

22
00:01:26.811 --> 00:01:28.940
FlightID represents a unique flight.

23
00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.565
Let's go ahead and
drag this field in the value section.

24
00:01:33.565 --> 00:01:35.920
Making sure to check that
we are counting the values.

25
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.338
This gives us the total number
of flights across all routes,

26
00:01:41.338 --> 00:01:45.214
however we just want to see the number
of flights on the ORD LAX route.

27
00:01:49.585 --> 00:01:53.300
Remember, our routes table only
contains flights leaving from Chicago.

28
00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:00.550
This means that we focus purely on
the arrival airport which is listed as

29
00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:06.214
the airport ID in the Routes PivotTable.

30
00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.400
As you can see, we now have a pivot table
that shows the number of flights for

31
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.630
each of the airports that
our company flies to.

32
00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.130
We're interested in the total
number of flights going to

33
00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.545
LAX which can be found in row 16.

34
00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.490
We're going to select this answer.

35
00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.060
Copy it.

36
00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.001
And then move back to the Exercise 4 tab
where we paste answer into cell G13.

37
00:02:40.085 --> 00:02:43.270
Now that we're done with the first
question, let's move to Question 4B.

38
00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.120
Here we're being asked
which route accounts for

39
00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.510
the lowest percentage of total revenue?

40
00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.740
Remember how we created
a calculator field for

41
00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:55.070
the total revenue in exercise three
that took into account 10% tax.

42
00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.310
We're going to use that field here
to determine the total revenue for

43
00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:59.140
each of the routes.

44
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.642
So let's head to the Pivot 4B tab and
select

45
00:03:05.642 --> 00:03:10.690
PivoTable in the Power Pivot
tab on the ribbon.

46
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.020
Just like before,
we want to place the pivot in this sheet.

47
00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.780
So we're going to select
Existing worksheet and click OK.

48
00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.676
Next we're going to take the total
revenue field from the flights pivot and

49
00:03:24.676 --> 00:03:26.567
drag it into the value section.

50
00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.930
Make me show that we sum the values.

51
00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.480
We want to look at the revenue
on a route by route basis.

52
00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.610
So let's grab the RouteID field
from the Route PivotTable and

53
00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.125
drag it into the raw section.

54
00:03:45.922 --> 00:03:49.930
We now have a table showing the total
revenue for each of the routes.

55
00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.410
However, this does not yet answer the
question since we are asked to determine

56
00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.230
which route accounts for
the lowest percentage of total revenue.

57
00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.580
So let's start by changing the pivot
table to show the revenue values

58
00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:03.920
are percentages.

59
00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.306
We do this by right-clicking
on the PivotTable and

60
00:04:07.306 --> 00:04:12.359
selecting Show Values As followed by
selecting Percentage of Grand Total.

61
00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:16.637
As we can see, the table now shows us what
percentage of the total revenue is coming

62
00:04:16.637 --> 00:04:17.940
from each of the routes.

63
00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.120
In order to determine the route that
accounts for this lowest percentage,

64
00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.521
let's right-click on the PivotTable again
and select Sort from lowest to highest.

65
00:04:31.204 --> 00:04:35.091
Now we can see that the Chicago to Salt
Lake City route is the one bringing in

66
00:04:35.091 --> 00:04:36.669
the least amount of revenue.

67
00:04:39.805 --> 00:04:45.840
So lets go back to the exercise 4 tab and
input the answer in the cell G17.

68
00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:57.100
The next question asks us to find for
the most popular month to fly to

69
00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:02.620
Fort Lauderdale or FLL as it is
designated by its airport code.

70
00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.570
Answering this question is going
to require the airport ID from

71
00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:10.000
Routes PivotTable along with the month
information from the Flights PivotTable.

72
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.530
Remember that the months in
the table are stored as numbers

73
00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:17.400
with January being month number one and
so on and so forth.

74
00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.890
Let's get started.

75
00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:21.750
Just like before we're going
to place the PivotTable

76
00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.220
in the tab associated with the question.

77
00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.811
So Let's head to the Pivot4C tab.

78
00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.130
As usual, we're going to select
the PivotTable option from the Power Pivot

79
00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:34.980
tab on the ribbon.

80
00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:40.295
Next, we select Existing Worksheet and
then click OK to create the PivotTable.

81
00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.760
We want to count the number of
flights heading to each destination.

82
00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:52.685
So let's go ahead and select the FlightID
field from the Flights Pivot And

83
00:05:52.685 --> 00:05:54.857
drag it into the value section,

84
00:05:54.857 --> 00:05:59.610
making sure that we're counting
the IDs to get the number of flights.

85
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.100
We want to see the number of
flights on a monthly basis.

86
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:08.510
So let's grab the months reel
from the Flights Pivot and

87
00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:09.780
drag it into the row section.

88
00:06:13.162 --> 00:06:16.050
Our PivotTable is now showing
us the number of flights for

89
00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:19.810
each month across all routes
flown by the airline.

90
00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:22.950
Since we are trying to determine
the most popular month specifically for

91
00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:24.840
the Chicago to Fort Lauderdale route.

92
00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.410
Wwe're going to go ahead and

93
00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:30.472
filter this table using the RouteID
field from the Routes PivotTable.

94
00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:37.170
Let's select the RouteID field and
drag it into the filter section.

95
00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:41.495
See how this adds a filter
above our PivotTable.

96
00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:45.870
We're going to click on
the filter we just created and

97
00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:48.760
select the ORD FLL route
from the drop down.

98
00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:01.029
Now our PivotTable is showing us
the number of flights on the Chicago to

99
00:07:01.029 --> 00:07:03.820
Fort Lauderdale route on a monthly basis.

100
00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:06.870
We want to know which
month is the most popular.

101
00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:11.277
So let's go ahead and solve the values
in column B by right-clicking,

102
00:07:11.277 --> 00:07:15.030
selecting Sort and
picking the Largest to Smallest option.

103
00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.389
As we can see,
month number 6 has the most flights.

104
00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:25.003
Hence, we go back to
the Exercise 4 tab and

105
00:07:25.003 --> 00:07:28.979
input that June was the most
popular month in cell G21.

106
00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:37.063
Finally, we're going to create a pivot
chart to show the number of flights per

107
00:07:37.063 --> 00:07:40.060
month on the Chicago-Philadelphia route.

108
00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:44.320
We've been provided with the chart area
where we are going to place this graph.

109
00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.016
So let's click on cell F26.

110
00:07:54.416 --> 00:07:56.835
And navigate to the PowerPivot
tab on the ribbon.

111
00:08:01.099 --> 00:08:03.001
Where we're going to select
the PivotChart option.

112
00:08:12.737 --> 00:08:15.250
We want to show the number
of flights per month.

113
00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:17.847
So we are going to grab the month
attribute from the Flights PivotTable.

114
00:08:22.364 --> 00:08:24.462
And drag it to the Access section.

115
00:08:28.899 --> 00:08:32.710
We also said the FlightID
attribute from the same table and

116
00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:37.549
drop it into the values section,
making sure we are counting the values.

117
00:08:42.656 --> 00:08:47.480
The chart we just created provides us with
an overview of the number flights per

118
00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:48.690
month.

119
00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:51.890
But since we assuring data
that changes over time,

120
00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:55.220
a line graph will be a more
appropriate representation.

121
00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:58.040
So let's go ahead and
update the chart type.

122
00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:02.869
This is done by clicking on the Chart,
go into the Design option and

123
00:09:02.869 --> 00:09:05.122
selecting Change Chart Type.

124
00:09:12.682 --> 00:09:16.279
Remember, we only want to show
the number of flights per month that

125
00:09:16.279 --> 00:09:19.560
are flying the Chicago/Philadelphia route.

126
00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:22.440
So we are going to need to filter
the data that is being plotted.

127
00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:28.940
We do this by selecting the RouteID and
dragging it into the Filter section.

128
00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:35.600
As you see, this creates a filter
in the upper corner of the graph.

129
00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:38.507
Let's click on this filter and
select ORD-PHL.

130
00:09:48.255 --> 00:09:54.364
Finally, we're going to change the name
of the chart by selecting the placeholder

131
00:09:54.364 --> 00:09:59.701
text and replacing it with Number of
Flights Flying the ORD- PHL Route.

132
00:10:03.869 --> 00:10:07.428
We can now see how the number of flights
on the Chicago Philadelphia route

133
00:10:07.428 --> 00:10:10.490
are distributed over
the course of the year.

134
00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:13.030
This route is clearly
more popular in June and

135
00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:15.900
November, whereas March is
the least popular month.

136
00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:20.630
In this section,
we learn how to create Power Pivots and

137
00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:23.779
Power Charts using multiple
data tables and filters.

138
00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:28.479
Now it is your turn to practice what you
just learned in the student workbook.

139
00:10:28.479 --> 00:10:35.956
