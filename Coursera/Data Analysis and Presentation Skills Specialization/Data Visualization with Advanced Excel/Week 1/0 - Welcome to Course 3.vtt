00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:13.950
Welcome to Data Visualization
with advanced Excel,

2
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.150
the third course in

3
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.790
the data analysis and
presentation skills,

4
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.715
the PWC Approach Specialization.

5
00:00:20.715 --> 00:00:23.535
If you were with us for
the first or second course,

6
00:00:23.535 --> 00:00:24.720
you may remember me.

7
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.640
I'm Alex Mannella,
I'm going to get you

8
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.625
started and talk about
how this course will run.

9
00:00:29.625 --> 00:00:33.150
I'll be back at the end of
the course to wrap things up.

10
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.760
In this course, we're
going to focus on

11
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.045
expanding your
analytical skills by

12
00:00:38.045 --> 00:00:39.860
using Excel to help you answer

13
00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.085
questions and tell
a story with your data.

14
00:00:43.085 --> 00:00:46.085
Here's something I would
like you to keep in mind.

15
00:00:46.085 --> 00:00:48.590
In this course, we are
using Excel to help you

16
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.915
develop your data
visualization skills.

17
00:00:50.915 --> 00:00:53.090
We've chosen the
software tool because it

18
00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.655
is widely available
to most of you.

19
00:00:55.655 --> 00:00:58.400
There are many tools
that we use to visualize

20
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.830
data for our clients every day,

21
00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:04.325
tools that provide
a wide variety of functionality.

22
00:01:04.325 --> 00:01:06.260
It's always important to choose

23
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:07.865
the tool that fits the needs

24
00:01:07.865 --> 00:01:11.750
of your client and the analysis
you'll be conducting.

25
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.370
Week one is all about linking
data and data models,

26
00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.630
you are going to learn
about the components of

27
00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.300
data sets and the
relational database model.

28
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.820
We'll show you how to
build these databases and

29
00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.330
data models within
Excel using PowerPivot.

30
00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.340
In week two, we'll show you

31
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.975
how you can use data to perform

32
00:01:29.975 --> 00:01:33.635
different types of scenario
and simulation analyses,

33
00:01:33.635 --> 00:01:35.720
to limit modeling risk and move

34
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.390
away from single point analytics.

35
00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.040
You'll have the opportunity to

36
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.020
practice these skills in Excel,

37
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.360
by levering some of
Excel's built-in tools

38
00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.630
including solver, data tables,

39
00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.145
the scenario manager,
and Goal seek.

40
00:01:51.145 --> 00:01:53.390
In week three. Once you are

41
00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.225
comfortable with
these new advanced skill sets,

42
00:01:56.225 --> 00:01:59.780
we'll show you how to visualize
the data, tell a story,

43
00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.940
and explore the data by reviewing

44
00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.270
core principles of data
visualization and dashboarding.

45
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.370
Finally, in week four.

46
00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:10.340
You'll get a chance
to use Excel to build

47
00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.650
complex graphs and
Power View reports,

48
00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.360
and then start to
combine them into

49
00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.610
dynamic dashboards using
tools such as form control,

50
00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.780
slicers, and
conditional formatting.

51
00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.515
At the end of the course,

52
00:02:23.515 --> 00:02:25.160
I'll be back to give a recap of

53
00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.545
what you learned and
share my perspective.

54
00:02:27.545 --> 00:02:30.720
Thanks again for joining us.
