[MUSIC]

2
00:00:09.105 --> 00:00:13.337
Throughout this course, we are going
to be following two continuous,

3
00:00:13.337 --> 00:00:16.630
fictitious storylines
from beginning to end.

4
00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.510
Our instructors will use these stories
to teach you concepts in this course.

5
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.050
In the first story,
we will be helping a small startup airline

6
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.170
connect their data sources,
help them solve some issues.

7
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.320
And in the second story, we'll be helping
a boutique retailer organize their data,

8
00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.310
and then make better decisions by
utilizing more advanced scenario and

9
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:39.749
visualization techniques.

10
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.120
Let's explore both of these
examples in more detail.

11
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.740
First, let's explore our airline example.

12
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.170
Throughout the student exercise, you will
be playing the role of data analyst for

13
00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.123
a small startup airline
operating out of the Chicago,

14
00:00:57.123 --> 00:00:59.129
Illinois area in the United States.

15
00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.800
The airline's management team has a strong
airlines operations background, but

16
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.870
don't have much financial or
data analytics experience.

17
00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.390
Many of their systems are disparate and
not connected.

18
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.090
In your interview, you are shocked to find
out that the airline cannot even pull,

19
00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.110
from a singular location, details about
aircraft that are flying specific routes

20
00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.250
and seating capacity of those aircraft.

21
00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.270
But, instead, would need to go and
open two separate data files.

22
00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.720
The airline is hoping that you
can help them solve their issues

23
00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.740
by not only connecting their data sources,
but also helping them make

24
00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.310
some large strategic decisions that they
need to make as they continue to grow and

25
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.390
position themselves in the market.

26
00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.650
For our second story,
you will be working on your own

27
00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.350
after having the techniques demonstrated
in the instructional videos.

28
00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.640
You now have been hired by
a rapidly expanding company

29
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.540
that manufactures clothing.

30
00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.985
The company has been around a long time,
and

31
00:01:57.985 --> 00:02:01.020
has operated under the strong
gut feeling of the founder.

32
00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.860
However, the founder's daughter is
taking a larger role in the business.

33
00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.840
She's combining her father's strong
gut market feel with her analytical

34
00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.139
analysis to drive a boom in sales.

35
00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.756
This sales growth has strained
the business infrastructure and

36
00:02:17.756 --> 00:02:20.570
many of the supporting processes.

37
00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.650
You've been hired to help
the company continue to enhance

38
00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.700
their analytical decision-making.

39
00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.060
Throughout this course,
we will be using Excel 2013 on a PC.

40
00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.890
If you have a different
version of Excel and

41
00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.310
are working on a Mac computer, most of the
features should still be available, but

42
00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.350
may be located in
slightly different menus.

43
00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.700
Second, all of the concepts learned
should be applicable across all versions.

44
00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:51.170
Also, keep in mind, Excel may not always
be the most powerful tool to address and

45
00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.320
demonstrate each of the concepts covered.

46
00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.670
There are many other tools
available in the market place.

47
00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.380
However, Excel is one of
the only tools that can answer

48
00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.630
all of the questions asked,
and is universally accessible.

49
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.750
Once again, all of the concepts
learned can be carried forward and

50
00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.270
used on a vast range of tools,
from Python to Tableau to R,

51
00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:18.260
based on what is required to answer
our specific business needs.

52
00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.065
Now, let's move into our weekly sessions
and see where the stories take us.

53
00:03:23.065 --> 00:03:24.094
Good luck.
