2
00:00:10.954 --> 00:00:13.457
Congratulations on
finishing your first week.

3
00:00:13.457 --> 00:00:18.051
We hope you found the information
helpful and the activities beneficial.

4
00:00:18.051 --> 00:00:20.621
We started the week by talking
about the layout of the course and

5
00:00:20.621 --> 00:00:23.830
giving you some basic guidance
around working with Excel.

6
00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.042
We then looked at components of data
sets and the relational database model.

7
00:00:28.042 --> 00:00:31.091
My colleague walked you through
the concept of keys and

8
00:00:31.091 --> 00:00:33.621
how they can help form
table relationships.

9
00:00:33.621 --> 00:00:34.877
We also looked at joins and

10
00:00:34.877 --> 00:00:39.700
how we can use them to allow multiple rows
from different tables to come together.

11
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.319
We also talked about SQL and
how it is used to give

12
00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:46.922
commands within a relational data base and
perform various functions on the data.

13
00:00:46.922 --> 00:00:49.590
Finally, we explored PowerPivot.

14
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.930
We used this tool to import and
prepare data to build relational models.

15
00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.790
We also saw how we can use
PowerPivot to visualize data.

16
00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:58.650
All along the way,

17
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.720
you've had the chance to practice what
you learned in your own Excel workbook.

18
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.350
We hope this practice has helped
you become more comfortable with

19
00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:06.860
performing these functions on your own.

20
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.490
Large datasets are extremely common today,
and they are only getting bigger.

21
00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.360
The ability to understand how data lives
and connects within a company provides

22
00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.780
deep insight into how it
functions on a day to day basis.

23
00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.480
We hope you enjoyed this week.

24
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.067
I'll be back next week to get you started.
