00:00:10.922 --> 00:00:12.279
When you have a database,

3
00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:16.180
it is important that we have a tool that
allows us to interact with the data.

4
00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.057
A common term you will hear while
interacting with database is SQL,

5
00:00:20.057 --> 00:00:24.547
Structured Query Language, this is
nothing more than a programming language

6
00:00:24.547 --> 00:00:29.460
designed to interact with databases, and
the data contained within the databases.

7
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.640
SQL stands for Structured Query Language.

8
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.260
It is used to give commands
within a relational database, and

9
00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.960
perform the following
functions on the data.

10
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.330
Create tables to store data within rows.

11
00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:51.250
Update tables so that the data is entered
into, and maintained within the database.

12
00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.190
Read data from tables so
that analysis can be performed.

13
00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.380
Delete data from tables so
the database can be maintained.

14
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.676
And in relational database software,
we'll use their own version of SQL.

15
00:01:03.676 --> 00:01:09.290
Hence, SQL vary slightly from database
software to database software.

16
00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.120
But they're essentially
the same languages.

17
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.120
Here are a few examples of
software you will use SQL with.

18
00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:23.520
Oracle Database, MySQL Database, Toad for
SQL Server and Microsoft Access.

19
00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.190
We won't be using SQL programming
language, but we will use Microsoft Excel

20
00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.319
pivot table functionality,
to extract data from the database.

21
00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.470
We are aware, that there are more
powerful database tools out there but

22
00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.270
throughout this course, we are going to
be using Excel, as it is flexible and

23
00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.950
can be used to demonstrate
a range of concepts.

24
00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.900
It is also very common in the market and
highly accessible.

25
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.080
Excel will be a great tool to practically
apply all that we have just learned.

26
00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:01.502
In the next video, you will learn all
about Excel's PowerPivot feature and

27
00:02:01.502 --> 00:02:04.998
practice how to apply to
concept we have covered.
