2
00:00:04.876 --> 00:00:09.314
For this exercise, we're being asked
by the COO of the airline to look into

3
00:00:09.314 --> 00:00:12.272
the specified metrics with
regards to flights and

4
00:00:12.272 --> 00:00:14.680
the aircraft that are being used.

5
00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.720
In order to answer the COO's question,
going to use the data model that we

6
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.710
created in the previous exercise along
with pivot charts and pivot tables.

7
00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.530
Let's start with question 2a where
we are being asked to look at

8
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.590
the number of flights that
use the A319 aircraft.

9
00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.110
We know from our previous
exercise that flight and

10
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.560
aircraft data are stored
in two separate tables.

11
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:45.350
However, we use the aircraft id field
to link these two tables together.

12
00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.210
This is going to make it very easy for
us to solve this problem.

13
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.020
Because pivot tables can be slightly
unpredictable and can expand automatically

14
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.210
if the data changes, we are going to be
placing our pivot table on a separate tab.

15
00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:00.080
As you can see,

16
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:05.350
we have a tab in the workbook named
pivot 2a, 2b, 2c and so forth.

17
00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.330
These are the tabs that we'll use
to ask a question 2a, 2b, etc.

18
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.870
So let's go ahead and
navigate to the pivot 2a tab.

19
00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.440
To set up a pivot table using power pivot,

20
00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.730
select the cell you would
like to place your table in.

21
00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:22.590
Here that is going to be cell A1.

22
00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.514
Now we're going to navigate to
the PowerPivot tab on the ribbon

23
00:01:28.514 --> 00:01:32.487
where we'll select manage and
Pivot Table option.

24
00:01:32.487 --> 00:01:36.606
The Pivot Table is all set to be
placed in the cell that we selected.

25
00:01:36.606 --> 00:01:40.907
So let's go ahead and
select OK to create the Pivot Table.

26
00:01:40.907 --> 00:01:47.470
PivotTables created through PowerPivot
operate similar to regular PivotTables,

27
00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.620
except for one main feature data can be
sliced and diced across multiple tables.

28
00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.020
We can see by clicking on our PivotTable

29
00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.653
that all four tables in our data
model appear on the right-hand side.

30
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.274
The question we are trying to
answer requires us to combine data

31
00:02:05.274 --> 00:02:09.413
from the aircraft pivot dataset with
the data from the flight pivot dataset, so

32
00:02:09.413 --> 00:02:11.917
let's go ahead and
expand those two elements.

33
00:02:18.395 --> 00:02:24.050
Now we can see the two fields that we are
looking for, flight ID and aircraft type.

34
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.274
So let's go ahead and
drag these two fields into the values and

35
00:02:27.274 --> 00:02:28.773
rows fields respectively.

36
00:02:35.994 --> 00:02:37.810
And we'll see a pivot table form.

37
00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.050
The Pivot Table is showing a count of the
Flight IDs which is what we want to show

38
00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.200
since we are trying to determine the
number of flights using the A319 aircraft.

39
00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.730
So if we look in cell B2 we can see

40
00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.230
that they were a total of 3879
flights using the A319 aircraft.

41
00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.107
So let's go ahead and

42
00:03:01.107 --> 00:03:04.832
link the value in the pivot table
to the answer on exercise 2 tab.

43
00:03:04.832 --> 00:03:08.970
Select the cell V13, and type =.

44
00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.195
Next, we'll navigate to the tab with our
Pivot and select the value in cell B2.

45
00:03:18.024 --> 00:03:21.990
Now if we were to be provided with updated
data tables we could refresh the pivot

46
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.950
which would automatically
update our answer in this tab.

47
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.030
Let's look at the second
question using a similar method.

48
00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.250
This time we're asked to
identify the most common type of

49
00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.230
aircraft used across all flights.

50
00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:41.560
The pivot table required will be very
similar to the one used in question 2a but

51
00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.520
we'll also need to use the sort function
to find the most commonly used aircraft.

52
00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:51.125
We will begin by navigating to the pivot
2b tab and opening power pivot.

53
00:03:54.364 --> 00:04:00.260
After selecting the pivot table option, we
can select existing worksheet and then OK.

54
00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.185
Similar to last time,
where we'll drop the FlightID and

55
00:04:05.185 --> 00:04:07.941
Aircraft Type into the ROWS and
VALUES section.

56
00:04:22.082 --> 00:04:24.800
We'll need to solve the selection
to find our solution.

57
00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.740
Select the Pivot table, right click and
select Sort Largest to Smallest.

58
00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.334
They should give us our desired answer.

59
00:04:47.336 --> 00:04:52.159
The next problem is a little trickier
as we must now use a different type

60
00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:55.034
of value calculation to find our answer.

61
00:04:55.034 --> 00:04:58.389
Let's set up our pivot
table in section 2C.

62
00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:00.478
By again,
going through the power pivot tab.

63
00:05:14.968 --> 00:05:19.700
Since we are interested in the type
of aircraft and average ticket price.

64
00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:22.327
Let's drag these fields into the rows and
values sections.

65
00:05:33.182 --> 00:05:38.710
We're looking for the maximum average
ticket price for the A320F graph.

66
00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:42.610
Click that field under the value
section and choose value field setting.

67
00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.720
Select Max and click OK.

68
00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.610
We will now see the maximum
ticket price for all aircrafts.

69
00:06:03.046 --> 00:06:05.840
Another feature of
PowerPivot is PivotCharts.

70
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:11.230
This allows you to visualize data
across multiple data sources.

71
00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:15.350
In this particular case we are being asked
to visualize the number of flights flown

72
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:16.530
for each aircraft type.

73
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:22.710
To do this we're going to select
the cell D12 in the Exercise 2 tab, and

74
00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:23.960
then opening PowerPivot.

75
00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:28.430
And select the Pivot Table option.

76
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:31.290
We are then going to select Pivot Chart.

77
00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:36.860
Similar to creating a Pivot Table we
are going to select the existing worksheet

78
00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:38.620
option and click OK.

79
00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.507
Once placed we can adjust the height and
weight of the chart.

80
00:06:48.585 --> 00:06:51.126
And select values for
the various axises and

81
00:06:51.126 --> 00:06:54.940
measurements similar to
creating a Pivot Table.

82
00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:59.790
For this exercise we need to find a number
of flights flown for each aircraft.

83
00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:04.342
So we drag the aircraft type attribute
from our aircraft pivot data set into

84
00:07:04.342 --> 00:07:05.505
the axis section.

85
00:07:11.845 --> 00:07:15.511
Then we drag our FlightID attribute
from our FlightsPivot dataset

86
00:07:15.511 --> 00:07:16.954
into our VALUES section.

87
00:07:20.425 --> 00:07:23.420
We can now see a chart detailing
our chosen information.

88
00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:26.740
Note that the title and other sections
of the chart can be adjusted.

89
00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:31.845
For now, we'll change the title to
something that matches what we are showing

90
00:07:31.845 --> 00:07:35.454
so that our viewer can understand
the information we are visualizing.

91
00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:48.850
Finally, take note of the filter in
the bottom right hand corner of the chart.

92
00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:53.020
This can be used to manipulate the chart
to filter on the values and other options.

93
00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:59.550
Let's select only B737 and
A320 options to demonstrate this.

94
00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.660
In this section,
we learned how to use power pivot and

95
00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:11.500
the relational data model to build pivot
tables and pivot charts to solve problems.

96
00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:15.490
We'll continue to explore these topics in
more detail in the following exercises.

97
00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:21.857
Now it is your turn to practice what you
just learned in the student workbook.

98
00:08:21.857 --> 00:08:31.857
