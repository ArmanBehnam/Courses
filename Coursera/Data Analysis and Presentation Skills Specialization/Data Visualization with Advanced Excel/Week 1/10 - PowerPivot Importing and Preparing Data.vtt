2
00:00:05.242 --> 00:00:10.519
In this video we are going to talk about
analyzing and summarizing data in Excel.

3
00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:12.520
There are several ways to do this but

4
00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:17.180
I'm going to introduce you to
a feature in Excel called PowerPivot.

5
00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.600
We're going to explore what it is and
its characteristics and its uses.

6
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.580
Let's start with what is PowerPivot and
what is it used for.

7
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:26.710
As the name implies,

8
00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.710
it is similar to PivotTable feature in
Excel that you're already familiar with.

9
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.130
However, the PowerPivot is able to
run pivot tables by merging several

10
00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.799
big datasets and run pivot tables
off of the consolidated data.

11
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.910
Let's start by looking at what the final
output looks like when we use PowerPivot.

12
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.660
Here you can see an example of
a pivot table that was built

13
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.120
using the PowerPivot feature.

14
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.050
As you can see, it looks identical
to the regular pivot table.

15
00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.770
However, the difference is what
happens behind the scenes.

16
00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.869
If you're going to learn
about PowerPivots,

17
00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:08.170
you need to be familiar with the internal
data model, also known as IDM.

18
00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.330
So what is IDM and
what does it have to do with PowerPivot?

19
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.750
IDM is the analytical engine that
Excel uses behind the scenes

20
00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.530
to construct the PowerPivot.

21
00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.000
It is basically a database in
which Excel organizes information.

22
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.030
There are two appealing features of IDM.

23
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.580
One, it can establish relationships
between multiple databases.

24
00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.120
And two, it can hold unlimited
number of rows and columns.

25
00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.070
You are only limited by
a 2 gigabyte workbook and

26
00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.800
the memory available on the machine
where Excel is running.

27
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.764
As a note,
this is only available in Excel 2013.

28
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.090
Now I'm going to show you how to
activate PowerPivot in Excel 2013,

29
00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.070
if it hasn't been already
activated on your machine.

30
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.142
Let's look at an Excel workbook.

31
00:01:55.142 --> 00:02:00.450
You'll notice PowerPivot tab on the main
ribbon of Excel, next to the View tab.

32
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.140
However, on occasions, even in Excel 2013,
you will not notice it.

33
00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.336
Then, to activate it, do the following.

34
00:02:07.336 --> 00:02:13.770
Under File > Options,
a window will pop up.

35
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.870
Select Add Ins option,
at the bottom of the window

36
00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.220
you'll notice Manage Options and
a corresponding drop down list.

37
00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.200
Select COM Add-Ins option and
click Go on the right.

38
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.170
Another window of COM Add-Ins will pop up,
select Microsoft Office PowerPivot for

39
00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.140
Excel 2013 option.

40
00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:40.380
Click OK, then you should see PowerPivot
tab on the top ribbon of the Excel.

41
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.085
On occasions it still doesn't appear,
in that case close out all Excel work

42
00:02:45.085 --> 00:02:48.257
books and re-open Excel,
then you should see it.

43
00:02:48.257 --> 00:02:53.592
In this video you learn
how to enable PowerPivot,

44
00:02:53.592 --> 00:03:00.083
in the next video,
you'll explore how to use this feature.
