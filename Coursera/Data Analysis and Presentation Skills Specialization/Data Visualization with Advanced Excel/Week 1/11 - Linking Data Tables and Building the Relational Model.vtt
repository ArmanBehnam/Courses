[MUSIC]

2
00:00:05.083 --> 00:00:09.589
In this first exercise, we've been asked
by the COO of the airline company that we

3
00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:12.220
work for
to analyze parts of their flight data.

4
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.890
Let's start by taking a look at some
of the data that we have been provided.

5
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.710
There are four data
tables in this workbook,

6
00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.350
each containing different
kinds of airline data.

7
00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:25.670
The first data table is
located on the Flights tab.

8
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.490
It contains information related
to flights out of Chicago,

9
00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.850
including their destination,
the ID of the aircraft that is used,

10
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:42.100
the scheduled departure time, pricing
information, and the date of the flight.

11
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.440
The next data table is
located on the Routes tab.

12
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.280
It provides insight into
the specific departure and

13
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.320
arrival airports, along with the distance
and list price for each route.

14
00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.470
Notice in column b,
that all flights are coming out of ORD,

15
00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.200
which is the international
airport quote for

16
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.934
O'Hare International Airport,
location in Chicago.

17
00:01:02.934 --> 00:01:07.400
The third data table is located on the Aircraft tab,
and

18
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.530
it provides specs for all the aircraft in
the fleet, including the type of aircraft,

19
00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.350
its seat capacity, and
fuel cost per seat per mile.

20
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.990
Finally, the table in the Airports tab
provides the full names of the airports,

21
00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.200
along with the number of available
gates at each of these airports.

22
00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.110
Now that we have a better
understanding of the available data,

23
00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.530
let's move on to the first exercise.

24
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.980
As we mentioned previously,

25
00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.920
we have been asked by our COO to analyze
some of the company's flight data.

26
00:01:37.935 --> 00:01:39.555
However, it is apparent for

27
00:01:39.555 --> 00:01:42.615
going through the data tabs,
that this is no simple task.

28
00:01:42.615 --> 00:01:46.465
Each of the four tables contains separate
pieces of information that we need to

29
00:01:46.465 --> 00:01:51.485
analyze, which prevents us from
performing an overall analysis of the data.

30
00:01:51.485 --> 00:01:55.905
For example, if the business were to ask
us to determine the number of slides that

31
00:01:55.905 --> 00:02:00.490
use the B737 aircraft,
we will probably start

32
00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.060
by looking at the flights table,
since it contains the number of flights.

33
00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.190
However, this table only contains a field
called AircraftID with no field for

34
00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.870
type of the aircraft to be found, in fact,

35
00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.349
the data is stored in an entirely
different data table.

36
00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.450
The Aircraft table contains the type
of aircraft for each plane, but

37
00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.510
has no connection to the number of
flights being flown using this aircraft.

38
00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.750
As the data is set up at the moment,
it would be an incredibly tedious task

39
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.740
to go back and forth between the two
tables, counting and matching the flights.

40
00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.740
Luckily, we use the relational
data model to form relationships

41
00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.850
between these tables, and
use the result to answer this question.

42
00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.950
Let's start by organizing our data
into a relational data model.

43
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.230
We will be using PowerPivot
to accomplish this.

44
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.060
As you may remember,
PowerPivot creates data models,

45
00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.841
which can then be built into
PivotTables and PivotCharts.

46
00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.960
Let's start by converting the flights
data into a table format, so

47
00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.710
that we can use it in our
PowerPivot data model.

48
00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:06.830
So, let's move back over
to the Flights tab.

49
00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.270
We're going to start with
selecting the entire data set.

50
00:03:14.635 --> 00:03:18.523
And then we will navigate to the Insert
button that can be found on the main

51
00:03:18.523 --> 00:03:22.950
ribbon, where we are then going to
select the Create Table option.

52
00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.340
This opens a dialogue box that
shows the range we just selected.

53
00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:32.280
Let's make sure that the indicator range
matches the data that we wanted to

54
00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.991
capture.

55
00:03:32.991 --> 00:03:37.932
For the flight table, we should be
covering all cells in the table,

56
00:03:37.932 --> 00:03:41.325
which ranges from cell A1 through cell J9637.

57
00:03:41.325 --> 00:03:45.530
As we can see, the flight data
set was correctly selected.

58
00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:47.780
There is an option name.

59
00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.150
My table has headers, since the data
we just selected has headers, so

60
00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.840
let's go ahead and select this option.

61
00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.540
It is considered the best practice to
include headers when selecting a data set,

62
00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.620
as this allows Excel to add informative
field names in the data model.

63
00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.250
Plus, it provides clarity to the user.

64
00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.450
Once we click the OK button, we can see
that the table formatting has changed.

65
00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.880
Now, the table will be formatted
to include a Default table style.

66
00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.150
This will let you know that you have
created a new named table range.

67
00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:23.560
If you look at the top left corner
while the table is selected,

68
00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.220
you'll notice instead of a cell,
it is referencing the name of the table.

69
00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.520
In a moment,
we'll change the name of the table.

70
00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:36.360
Now that we have successfully changed
the raw data table into an Excel table,

71
00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.130
selecting any cell in the table is going
to automatically bring up the Design tab.

72
00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.120
This is one of the properties
of an Excel table.

73
00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.950
It is considered the best
practice to name your table.

74
00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:50.640
So, let's click on the Design tab,
and select the table name option

75
00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.940
that can be found at the upper
left corner of this tab.

76
00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.450
Let's call this table, Flights Pivot.

77
00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.120
We're going to repeat these steps for
the remaining three data tables, so

78
00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.905
that we can use them in our PowerPivot.

79
00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:13.390
Let's start by navigating to the Routes
tab by clicking on cell A1 and

80
00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:16.470
using Ctrl+ A.

81
00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:19.420
Next, we're going to navigate
to the insert button that can

82
00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:23.570
be found on the main ribbon, where we're
going to select the Create Table option.

83
00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:28.720
We check that the pop-up box
shows the correct data set.

84
00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.020
We include the Headers
in our data selection.

85
00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.440
So, we're going to go ahead and

86
00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:37.890
check the My Table Has Headaers box
before closing the pop-up window.

87
00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:41.100
Now, we just have to update the name
of the table we just created.

88
00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:45.280
So, let's click on one of the cells,
navigate to the Design tab, and

89
00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:50.100
select a table name option, where we're
going to enter the name RoutesPivot.

90
00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.630
We're done with this table, so

91
00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:54.950
let's move in to the next step
where we'll find the aircraft data.

92
00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.930
Just like before, we start by selecting
all of our data, but instead of

93
00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:03.780
using the Insert tab, we're going to
create our table using the shortcut.

94
00:06:05.008 --> 00:06:08.780
Let's press Ctrl+ T, and
follow the same steps as before,

95
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:11.720
selecting the necessary data and
choosing the Headers option.

96
00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:18.150
We still need to change
the name of this table.

97
00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:21.660
So, let's click on a cell and
head to the Design tab,

98
00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:25.520
where we select the table name option and
change it to Aircraft Pivot.

99
00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:30.070
Let's move to the last tab,
and select the airport data.

100
00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:35.770
We're going to use the Ctrl+ T shortcut
again to turn it into an Excel table.

101
00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.980
And then we just need to change the name,
which we do,

102
00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:44.234
by clicking on a cell in the table,
and heading to the Design tab.

103
00:06:44.234 --> 00:06:48.480
We reserve the table name option,
and change it to AirportPivot.

104
00:06:52.388 --> 00:06:54.907
Now that we have created
our four data tables,

105
00:06:54.907 --> 00:06:57.760
it is time to complete our
data model in PowerPivot.

106
00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:03.840
First, we must load each individual
table into the PowerPivot tool,

107
00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.660
in order to add them to our data model.

108
00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:08.080
Let's start with the Flights table.

109
00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.620
First, we are going to
navigate to the table, and

110
00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:13.970
then we are going to click
on a cell in the table.

111
00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:19.240
Next, we are going to navigate
to the PowerPivot tab, and

112
00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:21.350
click on the Add to Data Model button.

113
00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:25.870
We need to do this for
the three other tables as well.

114
00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:31.120
So, let's move to the next step and
select any cell in the Routes table.

115
00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.210
Then we'll navigate to the PowerPivot tab,

116
00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:35.200
where we'll select Add
to Data Model button.

117
00:07:39.834 --> 00:07:44.071
The aircraft data is next, so let's
move to that tab, click on a cell and

118
00:07:44.071 --> 00:07:46.930
the table, and
select from the PowerPivot tab.

119
00:07:52.097 --> 00:07:55.983
Finally, let's go to the Airports tab,
select a cell in the table, and

120
00:07:55.983 --> 00:08:00.140
add it to the data model by clicking
the relevant button on the PowerPivot tab.

121
00:08:04.768 --> 00:08:07.680
Now that we've added all four
of the tables to our data model,

122
00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:11.560
we need to form the required
relationships between the tables,

123
00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:14.100
in order to finally create our PowerPivot.

124
00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:17.170
So, let's go to the tab where
our first pivot will be.

125
00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:21.710
And open the PowerPivot tool by
navigating to PowerPivot tab, and

126
00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:23.625
selecting the Manage option.

127
00:08:23.625 --> 00:08:26.990
Note that can take a couple
of seconds to load the data.

128
00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:30.490
Now that we have this page opened,
let's go to the View section, and

129
00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:31.530
click on Diagram View.

130
00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:36.230
This enables us to see each of
the tables we have previously saved

131
00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:37.880
within the data model.

132
00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:42.150
For each table, we need to identify
how it links to the other tables

133
00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:47.110
by dragging lines between the tables,
in order to create relationships.

134
00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:48.320
Note that in order for

135
00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:52.930
fields to be linked in PowerPivot,
they must have the exact same name.

136
00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:54.990
So, let's get started with
the flights data table.

137
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:59.460
We can see that Route ID also
appears in the Routes table.

138
00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:04.320
Which means that this is a foreign key
that we can use to link the two tables.

139
00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:07.660
We'll go ahead and create that
relationship by clicking on the Route ID

140
00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:12.360
in the Flights table, and dragging it
onto the Route ID in the Routes table.

141
00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:15.040
As you can see,
this creates a link in the diagram,

142
00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:18.100
showing that these two
fields have been linked.

143
00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:22.390
We can also see that the Aircraft ID
appears in both the Flights table,

144
00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:24.640
as well as the Aircrafts table.

145
00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:28.740
Let's go ahead and
click on it in the Flights table, and

146
00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:32.890
then drag it onto the corresponding
Aircraft ID field in the Aircrafts table.

147
00:09:37.023 --> 00:09:41.422
Finally, we're going to link the Airport
ID, that is in the routes table,

148
00:09:41.422 --> 00:09:44.470
to the Airport ID in the Airport table.

149
00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:47.090
Let's click on that field
in the Routes table, and

150
00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:49.991
drag it down to the corresponding
field in the Airport table.

151
00:09:49.991 --> 00:09:53.530
As we can see,
the diagram now has multiple lines on it,

152
00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:56.100
representing all of
the relationships we just created.

153
00:09:57.290 --> 00:10:00.600
Notice how all of the tables
are interconnected, and

154
00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.470
that there isn't a single
table that stands alone.

155
00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:06.590
This means that we're done
creating our relationships.

156
00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:08.807
So, let's go ahead and
close the PowerPivot view.

157
00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:13.003
You've just learned how to
create a relational data model.

158
00:10:13.003 --> 00:10:21.388
Now it is your turn to practice what you
just learned in the student workbook.

159
00:10:21.388 --> 00:10:24.550
