2
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.105
For this exercise, the CFO of the airline
has identified two major values that will

3
00:00:10.105 --> 00:00:13.709
need to be calculated in the future
to better understand rates and

4
00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:16.590
adjust to a changing business environment.

5
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.650
One, the cost per mile for
each aircraft in dollars.

6
00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.200
Two, the total revenue for

7
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:27.720
each flight, assuming that there is now
an additional 10% tax on all fares.

8
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.890
With a few simple Excel formulas,

9
00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.250
we can leverage existing fields in
our tables to address these changes.

10
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.764
Let's start with the first
question where we are being asked,

11
00:00:37.764 --> 00:00:40.149
which aircraft has the highest
fuel cost per mile?

12
00:00:42.448 --> 00:00:46.498
In order to answer this question we're
going to start by creating a field that

13
00:00:46.498 --> 00:00:49.567
will calculate the total cost per mile for
each aircraft.

14
00:00:52.014 --> 00:00:53.890
If we look in the aircraft data table.

15
00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.180
We see that we have the fuel cost
per seat per mile in column D.

16
00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.690
But this only gives us a cost for
a seat and not for the entire aircraft.

17
00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.780
However, the aircraft table
also provides a seat capacity

18
00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.350
of each aircraft in column C.

19
00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.190
If we combine information
in these two columns,

20
00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.880
we'll be able to calculate the total fuel
cost per mile for all of the aircrafts.

21
00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.520
We must also consider the fact that the
fuel cost per mile is measured in cents,

22
00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.030
which is expected due to its low value.

23
00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.170
However, we're going to want to show
the total cost per aircraft in dollars,

24
00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.970
since cents aren't a standard measure.

25
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.620
To do this we'll need to take the total
cost in cents and divide that by 100.

26
00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.660
Since there are 100 cents in each dollar.

27
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.340
Assuming that each flight is full, we can
calculate the fuel costs per mile by

28
00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.100
multiplying fuel costs per seat per mile
by the seat capacity of the airplane, and

29
00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.600
then dividing that value by 100
to get the total cost in dollars.

30
00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.910
We're going to be using a Calculated
Field to perform this calculation, and

31
00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.770
then we'll use this field
as input to a pivot table

32
00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.050
which will give us the analysis
we're looking for.

33
00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.860
So let's get started.

34
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.720
We're going to start by
creating the Calculated Field

35
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.720
by navigating to the PowerPivot tab and
selecting Manage.

36
00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.670
Within the Data View section,
there is an option that allows us to

37
00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.350
select the data table that we want
to add the Calculated Field to.

38
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.230
The values we want to use
are both in the aircraft table.

39
00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.090
So let's go ahead and
select AircraftPivot from the list.

40
00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.750
There is an add column option on the right
side which contains a formula bar that can

41
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:45.390
be used to input the calculations similar
to how regular formulas work in Excel.

42
00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.690
So let's go ahead and click on the formula
bar to start editing the formula.

43
00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.240
Remember, we want to multiply
the SeatCapacity field

44
00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.190
by the FuelCostperSeatMile field.

45
00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.140
And then we need to divide this by 100
in order to get a value in dollars

46
00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.960
instead of cents.

47
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.020
So we're going to type equals and

48
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.300
we'll select the SeatCapacity field
which populates in our formula.

49
00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.230
Next we input multiply and
select the FuelCostperSeatMile field.

50
00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.800
Now we just need to add division by
100 and we are done with our formula.

51
00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.720
Next, we need to provide a new name for
the new field.

52
00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.980
Let's call it FuelCostPerMile(Dollars),

53
00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.350
since it's consistent with
the naming of the other fields.

54
00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.410
We're almost done with
creating the Calculated Field.

55
00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.120
All that remains is making sure
the field is formatted correctly.

56
00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.090
To do this,
let's navigate to the formatting tab.

57
00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.660
And select Decrease Decimal,

58
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.390
which allows us to adjust
the Calculated Field to two decimals.

59
00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.110
Now that we have created the new field
which calculates the total fuel cost per

60
00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:56.630
mile for each aircraft we are going
to create a Pivot Table using

61
00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.780
this data to determine which aircraft
has the highest fuel cost per mile.

62
00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:07.900
Let's create our Pivot Table in a separate
tab, just like we did for exercise two.

63
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.390
So let's head to the tab named Pivot 3A.

64
00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.384
We want to place the Pivot Table
in the top left corner, so

65
00:04:16.384 --> 00:04:20.752
let's select cell A1 before navigating
to the PowerPivot tab on the ribbon.

66
00:04:27.057 --> 00:04:29.010
Here we select the Pivot Table option.

67
00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:35.390
Brings up a pop-up window where we're going
to select the existing worksheet for

68
00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:36.550
the location of the table.

69
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.340
And then we click OK to create the table.

70
00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:46.244
Next, we're going to drag our new
Calculated Fields into the values section

71
00:04:46.244 --> 00:04:50.387
which provides us with a total sum of
the cost across all aircraft types.

72
00:04:54.892 --> 00:04:57.953
We want to know the cost for
individual airlines, so

73
00:04:57.953 --> 00:05:02.760
let's drag the aircraft type into
the rows section of the Pivot Table.

74
00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.270
Since we want to know which aircraft
has the highest fuel cost per mile,

75
00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.070
we're going to right-click
on the Pivot Table, and

76
00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:13.560
select sort from largest
to smallest in the menu.

77
00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:21.210
We can now see that the B737 aircraft
has the highest fuel cost per mile,

78
00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.140
among the aircrafts flown by our company.

79
00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:28.374
Let's go back to the exercise three
tab and put that answer into cell G13.

80
00:05:43.246 --> 00:05:45.373
As part of the next
question in exercise 3,

81
00:05:45.373 --> 00:05:49.236
we're being asked to determine which
flights have the highest total revenue.

82
00:05:53.127 --> 00:05:54.845
If we look at the Flights table,

83
00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:59.194
we notice that we have the total fare for
each flight in column H.

84
00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:05.017
We are going to create a new Calculated
Field that allows us to calculate

85
00:06:05.017 --> 00:06:09.950
the total revenue by applying a 10% tax to
the total fares collected for each flight.

86
00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.581
So let's head back to the exercise
three tab and let's get started.

87
00:06:18.623 --> 00:06:22.819
Just like before, we start by
navigating to the PowerPivot Tab,

88
00:06:22.819 --> 00:06:24.360
and selecting Manage.

89
00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:29.810
Within the data view section,
there's a list of available data tables.

90
00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:33.280
Since we want to calculate the total
revenue based on the total fares that can

91
00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:35.580
be found in the Flights table,

92
00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:37.870
we're going to select
FlightsPivot from the list.

93
00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:42.240
Next, we're clicking the formula
bar on the right side of the window

94
00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.650
to start entering our formula.

95
00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:50.120
Remember, the total revenue is going to be
equal to the total fares minus a 10% tax.

96
00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:54.701
Hence, we are going to multiply
the total fare by 0.9.

97
00:06:56.663 --> 00:06:58.345
So let's type equals and

98
00:06:58.345 --> 00:07:03.000
then we select the total fare field
which populates in our formula.

99
00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:11.680
Next we add multiple type .9 and
press enter to close the formula.

100
00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.547
Then we are going to name
this new field Total Revenue.

101
00:07:18.903 --> 00:07:21.604
Now that we have created
our Calculated Field,

102
00:07:21.604 --> 00:07:24.643
which provides us with
the total revenue per flight,

103
00:07:24.643 --> 00:07:29.300
taking into account of the 10% new tax,
we are going to create a pivot using this

104
00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:33.510
data in order to determine which
flights have the highest total revenue.

105
00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.700
We're going to create our pivot
table in a separate tab again, so

106
00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:40.020
let's head to the tab named Pivot 3B.

107
00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:44.005
We want to place the pivot
table in the top left corner,

108
00:07:44.005 --> 00:07:48.292
so let's select cell A1 before navigating
to the PowerPivot tab on the ribbon.

109
00:07:52.275 --> 00:07:54.450
Here we select the Pivot Table option.

110
00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:59.532
Which brings up a pop-up window
where we're going to select Existing

111
00:07:59.532 --> 00:08:03.920
Worksheet for the location of the table
and then we click OK to create the table.

112
00:08:10.783 --> 00:08:14.945
Next we're going to drag the Total Revenue
Field into the value section which

113
00:08:14.945 --> 00:08:18.408
provides us with a total sum of
all revenue across all flights.

114
00:08:30.565 --> 00:08:34.077
But we want to know the total revenue
on a flight-by-flight basis, so

115
00:08:34.077 --> 00:08:37.554
let's drag the Flight ID into
the row section of our pivot table.

116
00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:43.126
As you can see this produces
a large list of flights and

117
00:08:43.126 --> 00:08:45.780
their corresponding revenues.

118
00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:48.980
We want to see which flight
has the largest revenue.

119
00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:51.119
So let's right click
on the pivot table and

120
00:08:51.119 --> 00:08:53.626
select Sort From Largest
to Smallest in the menu.

121
00:08:57.713 --> 00:09:02.101
We can now see that there are 4 flights
that all have the highest revenue.

122
00:09:02.101 --> 00:09:04.481
So let's go ahead and copy these values.

123
00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:10.500
Next, we're going to navigate
back to the Exercise 3 tab, and

124
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:13.351
we're going to paste our
answer into cell G17.

125
00:09:17.195 --> 00:09:22.174
The final question in Exercise 3 asks
us to provide a visual representation of

126
00:09:22.174 --> 00:09:25.160
the revenue distribution
across all flights.

127
00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:31.120
This chart is going to rely on the Total
Revenue Field that we just created.

128
00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:33.460
So we don't need to create
a new Calculated Field.

129
00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:37.620
Instead of using this data
to create a pivot table,

130
00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:39.950
we are going to use it
to create a pivot chart.

131
00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:40.780
So let's get started.

132
00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:45.240
First, similar to what we
did with the pivot tables,

133
00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:49.430
we are going to center the cell that
we would like to place our chart in.

134
00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:51.870
Here, we have been provided
with the chart area.

135
00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:54.388
Next, we navigate to the Power-
Pivot tab on the ribbon.

136
00:10:00.253 --> 00:10:02.026
Select the PivotChart option.

137
00:10:06.926 --> 00:10:11.022
We are going to drive the flight
attribute into our access section.

138
00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:23.647
And the total revenue attribute
into a value section,

139
00:10:23.647 --> 00:10:26.697
since we are using this field
as a value of measurement.

140
00:10:28.959 --> 00:10:33.787
The chart that we just created provides us
with a basic view of the various revenue

141
00:10:33.787 --> 00:10:35.280
levels across flights.

142
00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:38.710
To sort this from largest to smallest,

143
00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:41.950
select the drop-down in the bottom
left corner that says Flight ID.

144
00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:45.680
And select More Sort
Options from the menu.

145
00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:49.380
This brings up a pop-up window that
allows us to sort the data in the chart.

146
00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:52.101
Select Descending Z to A.

147
00:10:54.643 --> 00:10:58.500
And pick Sum of
Total Revenue from the list.

148
00:10:58.500 --> 00:10:59.580
Click OK to confirm.

149
00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:04.245
Finally, we are going to change
the name of the chart by selecting

150
00:11:04.245 --> 00:11:07.712
the placeholder text, and
replacing it with Total Revenue by

151
00:11:07.712 --> 00:11:13.338
Flight. We can now see that
there are a few flights

152
00:11:13.338 --> 00:11:19.000
with very high total revenue amounts with
a significant drop-off after this level.

153
00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.186
In this section, we learn how to create
and store Calculated Fields in PowerPivot and

154
00:11:24.186 --> 00:11:28.714
then use these new fields to create
PowerPivots, and PowerCharts.

155
00:11:28.714 --> 00:11:32.464
Now it's your turn to practice what you
just learned in the student workbook.

156
00:11:34.728 --> 00:11:44.728
