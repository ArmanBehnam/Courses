00:00:11.183 --> 00:00:12.598
Hello, and welcome back.

3
00:00:12.598 --> 00:00:14.070
I'm Halden Williams.

4
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.309
In this video,
I'm going to discuss chart slashing.

5
00:00:17.309 --> 00:00:21.420
Selecting the optimal chart for
conveying your message is critical.

6
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.030
The first step in this process is
to determine what your message is.

7
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.280
Ask yourself questions
in framing your message.

8
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.660
Are you trying to convey discrete or
continuous values?

9
00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.330
Are you trying to compare more than
one variable, show dependent steps or

10
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:37.200
general patterns?

11
00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.280
Early in the course, Carrie mentioned
we'll teach you how to make five charts.

12
00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.340
A bar or column chart,
a combination line and bar chart,

13
00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.230
a Gantt chart, a heat map and
a 100% stacked chart.

14
00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.040
We've selected these as they are some of
the more common charts found in business.

15
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.620
And they provide a good foundation for
more complex charting.

16
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.060
Let's review them in bit more detail.

17
00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.730
A bar chart, also known as a column chart,

18
00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.580
has the height of each bar scaled to its
value to allow comparison to other bars.

19
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.270
This may be the most common type of
graph used in business when visualizing

20
00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:14.180
discrete values.

21
00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.440
A combination line and bar chart shows
how two variables relate to each other.

22
00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.050
This can be useful when trying to
convey multiple series of related data

23
00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.230
in one visualization.

24
00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.890
A heat map encodes values as colors,
allowing for

25
00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.830
patterns to be identified more easily.

26
00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.550
A Gantt chart helps
visualize related timelines.

27
00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.849
Gantt charts are ubiquitous in business,
though often poorly implemented.

28
00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.010
A 100% stacked chart displays
relative proportions

29
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.520
of multiple variables'
contributions to a value.

30
00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.280
We'll spend more time walking through
detailed development of each these data

31
00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.203
visualizations as the week progresses.
