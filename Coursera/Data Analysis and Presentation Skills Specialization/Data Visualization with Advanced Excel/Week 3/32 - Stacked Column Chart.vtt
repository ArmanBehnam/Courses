2
00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:05.372
In problem three,

3
00:00:05.372 --> 00:00:09.310
we're going to be looking at stacked
column charts in more detail.

4
00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:13.640
We're being asked to review the average
delay times on the Boston to Chicago route

5
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.420
and see how it compares
to our competitors.

6
00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.360
We've been given data for
the average delays on that route for

7
00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.540
our airline as well as for
its main four competitors.

8
00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.010
We're going to create a chart using
this data that allows us to show

9
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.150
how we're performing compared
to the other airlines.

10
00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.200
Let's start by taking a closer look
at the data that we have been given.

11
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.070
The table splits up the delay
times into six different buckets,

12
00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.840
starting at on time and ending with
flights that were delayed over an hour.

13
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:41.940
For each of the airlines,

14
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.380
we can see how many of their flights
fell into each of these buckets.

15
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.550
Now it's important to note that
the airline that has the most flights that

16
00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.260
fall into the 60 plus minutes bucket isn't
necessarily the worst airline, since it

17
00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.380
may just be that this particular company
has many more flights than the others.

18
00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.250
Hence, we will need to normalize
the data using percentages in order for

19
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.170
us to be able to compare
the different players.

20
00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.690
So now that we have determined that we're
going to have to transform the numbers

21
00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.740
we have been given into percentages,
we're going to complete the table below.

22
00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.230
First, we're going to need to calculate
the total number of flights per airline.

23
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.020
And then we can use those total to
determine what percentage of that

24
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.390
airline's flights fell
within each of the buckets.

25
00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.380
We're going to put the total number of
flights for each airline in row 18.

26
00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.870
So let's click on cell D18 and
type equals followed by SUM.

27
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.305
We want to sum all the values in column D,
so we're going to select cells D12

28
00:01:37.305 --> 00:01:40.990
through D17, and
then we can close the formula.

29
00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.824
Now that we have the total number
of flights for our employer,

30
00:01:45.824 --> 00:01:50.477
we can copy this formula to the right to
obtain the totals for the other airlines.

31
00:01:52.664 --> 00:01:55.427
Now that we have the total number
of flights for each airline,

32
00:01:55.427 --> 00:01:58.485
we can calculate the percentages for
each of the buckets.

33
00:01:58.485 --> 00:02:01.215
We're going to use
the table below to do this.

34
00:02:01.215 --> 00:02:04.415
We want to know what percentage
of our flights are on time.

35
00:02:04.415 --> 00:02:07.480
So we're going to select cell D21 and

36
00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.650
type equals followed by the number of
flights that can be found in cell D12.

37
00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.410
And then we're going to divide that
by the total number of flights

38
00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.930
that can be found in D18.

39
00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:21.130
As we can see,

40
00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.600
42 percent of our flights are on
time on the Boston to Chicago route.

41
00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.740
We would like to be able to copy this
formula down the rest of the column, but

42
00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.220
that's going to require us to
perform some cell locking first.

43
00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.510
So let's go back into cell D21 and double
click to edit the formula we just wrote.

44
00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.770
We don't want our reference to
the totals row to increment

45
00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.570
when we copy the formula down.

46
00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.490
However, we do want to be
able to increment the column,

47
00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.470
since we're also going to
copy it out to the right.

48
00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.131
Hence, we're going to select
the second argument in our formula, and

49
00:02:53.131 --> 00:02:55.828
press F4 twice to lock the row,
but not the column.

50
00:02:59.367 --> 00:03:01.602
Now we're ready to copy the formula down.

51
00:03:05.151 --> 00:03:09.805
As we can see, the total of
the percentages in column D equals 100%.

52
00:03:09.805 --> 00:03:12.155
We've confirmed that our formula works.

53
00:03:12.155 --> 00:03:14.486
So let's copy it out to
the right to complete the table.

54
00:03:19.873 --> 00:03:24.245
Now that we have all of our data ready,
it's finally time to build our chart.

55
00:03:24.245 --> 00:03:27.110
Let's get started by selecting
this entire table and

56
00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.660
then navigating to the insert
tab on the Excel ribbon.

57
00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.360
We've determined that we
want a stacked column chart.

58
00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.540
So let's click on the column chart
button in the chart section.

59
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.687
We are working with percentages, so

60
00:03:39.687 --> 00:03:43.247
we're going to select the 100%
stacked column chart option.

61
00:03:58.302 --> 00:04:03.487
Now, as you can see, our chart shows
the delay times on the horizontal axis.

62
00:04:03.487 --> 00:04:07.996
We can change this by selecting the chart
and going to the Design tab on the ribbon

63
00:04:07.996 --> 00:04:11.780
and selecting the Switch Row/Column
button on the data section.

64
00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.520
We have successfully created the chart
that our boss was looking for.

65
00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:19.860
However, it is definitely not ready for
presentation yet.

66
00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.740
So let's spend some time applying
everything that we have learned in this

67
00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.200
course and making sure we format
the chart so that it provides a clear and

68
00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.020
concise answer to the CEO's question.

69
00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.530
For example, we should add a clear and
descriptive title to the graph and

70
00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.790
we should change the color
scheme to be more meaningful.

71
00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.070
Let's start by giving
our new chart a title.

72
00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:47.068
We want to give it a descriptive name,
so let's select the placeholder text,

73
00:04:47.068 --> 00:04:49.340
and then we're going to rename it,

74
00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:54.288
Comparison of Delay Times Between Airlines
for the Boston to Chicago Route.

75
00:04:56.476 --> 00:05:00.200
Next, we're going to add some
access labels to our new chart.

76
00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.290
Similar as for exercise one and
two, we select the chart and

77
00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:08.510
navigate to the Design tab,
where we click on Add Chart Element.

78
00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:14.600
Since the airline names on the horizontal
axis are pretty self-explanatory,

79
00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.980
we only need to add an axis title for
the vertical axis.

80
00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:21.880
So we're going to select Access Titles,
and then Primary Vertical.

81
00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.370
Now we just have to edit
the text of the title we created.

82
00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.750
So let's select the placeholder text and

83
00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.290
replace it with percentage
of each delay time category.

84
00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:39.040
In this chart, the legend is very
important since it shows the user

85
00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.720
different buckets for the delays that
we are representing on the chart.

86
00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.860
So in order to place emphasis
on the importance of the legend,

87
00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.610
we're going to place it to
the right of the chart.

88
00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:52.270
To do this, we're going to right-click
on the chart legend in order to bring up

89
00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:54.070
the formatting menu.

90
00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:56.570
We want to format the legend,
so let's go ahead and

91
00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:58.290
select Format Legend in the menu.

92
00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:02.720
This brings a pop-up with
a variety of formatting options,

93
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.960
including Legend Positions.

94
00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.390
We want it to be to the right,
so let's select that option and

95
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:09.610
then close the pop-up window.

96
00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:13.630
As we can see, the legend is now
on the right side of the chart.

97
00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:19.150
The current color scheme isn't very
representative of the delay times.

98
00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:22.680
So let's make the chart easier to read
by using more appropriate colors for

99
00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.660
the different delay buckets.

100
00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:29.100
We can use green for the on-time flights,
and gradually transition to red for

101
00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:30.950
the flights that are delayed over an hour.

102
00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.010
Let's start with the on-time bucket.

103
00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:37.450
In order to change
the color of this series,

104
00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:40.890
we're going to right click on one
of the elements of the series,

105
00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:44.590
which brings up a menu where we
can select format data series.

106
00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:49.950
We want to change the color, so
let's expand the fill category and

107
00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:51.260
then click on the color drop down.

108
00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:55.570
Since we're working on the on-time bucket,
we're going to pick green.

109
00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:00.839
If we close the pop-up window, we can see
that the first bar has now become green.

110
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.940
Next, let's do the 0 to
15 minute delay bucket.

111
00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:11.520
Just like before, we right click on one
of the elements in the data series, and

112
00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:15.030
bring up the formatting menu by selecting
format data series in the menu.

113
00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:19.709
In the pop-up window,
we go to the fill section,

114
00:07:19.709 --> 00:07:23.330
where we select a light shade of green.

115
00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:24.610
But instead of closing the window,

116
00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:28.720
we're going to keep it open to enable us
to continue editing the remaining buckets.

117
00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:34.200
As you can see, our pop-up window
now let's us edit this data series.

118
00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:38.930
We're going to select a light
shade of yellow for this bucket,

119
00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:41.860
since it represents the 16
to 30 minute delays.

120
00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:47.020
Next, still keeping the pop-up window
open, we select the fourth bucket.

121
00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:52.210
For this data series,
we're going to select a yellow fill.

122
00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:56.540
Notice how our chart is updating
automatically every time we

123
00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:57.420
pick a new color.

124
00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:02.670
So let's do the second to last bucket,
which is going to be orange.

125
00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:07.167
Once more, we click on an element in
the data series, and then we select orange

126
00:08:07.167 --> 00:08:15.170
under the color fill menu Finally,
we select the 60+ minute delayed bucket.

127
00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:17.760
We're going to use red for this one.

128
00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:20.484
So let's go ahead and
select red from the color fill menu.

129
00:08:23.157 --> 00:08:26.897
Now that we're done with formatting our
colors, we can close our pop-up window.

130
00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:32.090
Notice how we have used the color tone in
graduation to highlight the severity of

131
00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:34.380
the delays and their impact.

132
00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:37.030
This makes the message of this
chart clear and efficient.

133
00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:40.330
Now that we have successfully
formatted our graph,

134
00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:44.070
it is easy to see how our airline
compares against its competitors.

135
00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:49.670
Notice how our airline has about 75%
of flights that arrive on-time or

136
00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:51.940
with less than a 15 minute delay.

137
00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:55.800
This is a great statistic, especially
if we compare this to competitors,

138
00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:58.309
who can only claim a 50% success rate.

139
00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:03.370
This is the type of message that we
want to relay to our marketing team.

140
00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:06.910
They now have the data to support a
marketing campaign boasting their on-time

141
00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:10.520
flights for this route to hopefully
recuperate some of the lost passengers.

142
00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:15.140
In this video, you learned how to
create a stacked column chart.

143
00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:19.068
Now it's your turn to practice
in the student workbook.

144
00:09:19.068 --> 00:09:25.707
