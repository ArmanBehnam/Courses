00:00:11.181 --> 00:00:14.495
Hello, I'm Halden Williams and
I help our clients design and

3
00:00:14.495 --> 00:00:17.375
execute large-scale
transformations of finance.

4
00:00:17.375 --> 00:00:20.154
These consulting projects typically
start with the find the strategy and

5
00:00:20.154 --> 00:00:22.230
target operating model for
a firms finance function.

6
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.580
Successful finance transformation
relies heavily upon data analytics

7
00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.330
to measure progress.

8
00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.740
This week we'll explore some of the
fundamental aspects of data visualization.

9
00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.120
In the first video this week,

10
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.570
Carrie introduced you to
the definition of data visualization.

11
00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.500
Let me recap what it is.

12
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.330
In simplest terms it's the presentation
of data in a pictorial or

13
00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.080
graphical format to support
communication of a story.

14
00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.730
In this data storytelling we rely on upon
visualization as the process of displaying

15
00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:58.200
data in a visual context to communicate
patterns, trends or summary of the data.

16
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.250
When communicating information or
summaries about any data set especially

17
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.736
larger complex set, it is important to
display information in an effective way so

18
00:01:06.736 --> 00:01:10.980
as to clearly and concisely
communicate analytical conclusion

19
00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.640
which are relevant to your
overall data storage.

20
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.137
So why data visualization matter?

21
00:01:16.137 --> 00:01:19.878
Effective data visualization helps
an audience analyze, understand and

22
00:01:19.878 --> 00:01:22.440
draw conclusions through
summarization of data.

23
00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.270
In a business setting data visualization
can efficiently convey a message or

24
00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:29.920
answer a specific question.

25
00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.930
For example, is our business doing well or
do we need to take action or

26
00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:34.809
plot a different course?

27
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.370
Simplicity of communicating data
driven conclusions is one reason for

28
00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.360
the popularity of dashboards and
key performance indicators or KPIs.

29
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.760
Data can be communicated visually
in a variety of formats and

30
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.870
effective data visualization will
help make informed decisions and

31
00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.219
judgments based on results
of these practices.

32
00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.710
You're likely familiar with popular data
visualization including tables, graphs,

33
00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.030
and charts.

34
00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.770
We'll discuss principles to help
enable effective data storytelling

35
00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.330
through selection, design, and
creation of table and charts.

36
00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.410
Let's start with a simple example.

37
00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.970
Take a look at the two
diagrams on your screen.

38
00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.330
On the left, you have a simple table and
on the right, you have a chart.

39
00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.940
They both outlined revenue growth over
the past four years for client A.

40
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.850
Which image is easier to understand and
draw a conclusion from?

41
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.610
Each of these data
visualization has merit.

42
00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.440
However, a chart is more
useful in summarizing the data

43
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.590
into format the audience can
understand and draw conclusions from.

44
00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.930
It simplifies the communication
of relative differences among

45
00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.430
the values presented.

46
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.780
Charting the growth line over the bars
showing your every year revenue

47
00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.730
displays the same information
as the table to the left.

48
00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.560
The benefit of this approach though,

49
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.670
is that it immediately conveys
the relevant trend overtime.

50
00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.590
You'll notice it's less immediate for
a reader to determine the year over

51
00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.420
year trend when reading tabular
presentation of this data.

52
00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.800
Charts are a summary data
visualization technique which present

53
00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.310
outputs that are easy to understand,

54
00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.760
and allow an audience to quickly
interpret data and draw conclusions.

55
00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.130
The chart outlining revenue growth is
a simple example of how data visualization

56
00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:13.980
is used in everyday business settings.

57
00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.810
There are various uses for
illustrative charts and summaries.

58
00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.060
Reporting, status updates and

59
00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.100
as previously mentioned as
part of your larger dashboard.

60
00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.480
We'll go through more examples
as the course progresses.

61
00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:27.950
Before we start building tables and

62
00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.830
charts, let's examine some underlying
principles of data visualization.

63
00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.260
We'll frame the examination by
starting with a pressing question.

64
00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.420
Why is it that some charts are easier
to understand than others?

65
00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.430
Recall for a moment the chart
you had trouble understanding.

66
00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:42.320
What made it challenging?

67
00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:44.790
Did it have too many lines?

68
00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:45.910
Too much color?

69
00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:47.440
Or too many numbers?

70
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.040
Did it miss or
otherwise distort key information?

71
00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.870
Studies have shown that are minds
is constantly trying to sort and

72
00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.860
group objects in order
to draw conclusions.

73
00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.080
Academic research in this field
started in the early 1900s, and

74
00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.810
continues to inform data presentation
in business settings today.

75
00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.150
We'll explore six fundamental principles
and a few related observations.

76
00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.700
However, we encourage you to
explore the field further

77
00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.750
as you develop your data
visualization skills.

78
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.660
Let's have a look at some illustrations
of these fundamental principles.

79
00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.920
Studies have shown that when objects
are similar in shape or color, or

80
00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.400
look similar to one another,
we perceive them as a group.

81
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.990
The reverse of this similarity principal,

82
00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.580
which is often called an anomaly,
occurs when a a dissimilar object becomes

83
00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.490
the focal point in a group of objects that
is otherwise comprised of similar objects.

84
00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.410
When a space is not completely enclosed,
it is possible for

85
00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.640
us to perceive the remaining
space to create closure.

86
00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.460
Continuity occurs when two or more objects
are linked in a way in which the eye is

87
00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.650
compelled to move through one of them and
continue to the next such as a data line.

88
00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.771
When objects are enclosed by a visual
border such as a line or a field if

89
00:04:53.771 --> 00:04:58.282
color they are perceived to belong
together and set a part in distinct group.

90
00:04:58.282 --> 00:05:02.064
An example of this is
banded rows in a table.

91
00:05:02.064 --> 00:05:05.008
Point of connection is arguable
the strongest of this six principles we

92
00:05:05.008 --> 00:05:06.240
are reviewing.

93
00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.160
When objects are connected by a line or

94
00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.400
other means, we tend to perceive
them as being together.

95
00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.950
Finally, objects that
are placed close together

96
00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:16.710
will likely be perceived to
be part of the same group.

97
00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:19.229
This can be useful for linking or
de-linking information.

98
00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:22.780
In the example,
instead of seeing nine dots,

99
00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.070
we perceive them as three
groups of three dots.

100
00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:29.154
Keep these principles in mind when
creating charts and graphs for

101
00:05:29.154 --> 00:05:31.069
your own data visualization purposes.

102
00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:34.421
And remember, the only limits to the
application of these design principles is

103
00:05:34.421 --> 00:05:36.231
your creativity in visual storytelling.

104
00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.040
Now that we have covered some of
the fundamental principles there

105
00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.810
are a few other key design
considerations we make in comparison.

106
00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:47.400
Each element of visualization must
be carefully weighed to ensure

107
00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.600
the optimal communication.

108
00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:53.190
Frequently we add text to
highlight points of interest or

109
00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:55.570
conclusions in data visualizations.

110
00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:58.320
We must thoughtfully consider
the orientation of text and

111
00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.830
the impacts this will
convey to our audience.

112
00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:05.470
Angle the vertical text can be challenging
to read and will slow down comparisons.

113
00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:08.900
Size and data visualization
traditionally indicates importance.

114
00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:13.790
However, be careful when using size
alone for comparison as individuals

115
00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:18.170
often had difficulty assessing how
much bigger one item is from another.

116
00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:22.460
This is one reason why pie charts and
pictograms are less than ideal charts.

117
00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.970
Color is another common way to compare
items, and an important consideration for

118
00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:28.780
data visualization,
as it can aid your message, but

119
00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:31.550
can easily become
distracting to the audience.

120
00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:35.210
Considerations as to whether something
will be printed in gray scale, or

121
00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:38.550
the ability of your audience to
distinguish color if they're colorblind,

122
00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:41.950
may seem trivial, but could really
impact the effectiveness of your story.

123
00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.870
Consistency of color throughout
graphics is also important.

124
00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:49.870
Whether that means sticking to
a color palette or color scheme or

125
00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:52.410
making sure all the shades
match as they should.

126
00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:57.290
Finally, length and
direction of objects helps compare items.

127
00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:59.200
For example, in a bar chart,

128
00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.899
the longer bar translates to
greater value being represented.

129
00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:07.790
In this video we discussed what data
visualization is and why it's important.

130
00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:11.759
Data visualization is an expansive field
and as you develop your skill set we

131
00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:15.428
encourage you to further explore
the numerous resources available.

132
00:07:15.428 --> 00:07:21.371
