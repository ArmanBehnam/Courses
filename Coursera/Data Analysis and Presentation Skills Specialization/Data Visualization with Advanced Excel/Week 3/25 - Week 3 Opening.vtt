00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.645
Welcome back to week 3.

2
00:00:12.645 --> 00:00:15.915
This week we are going to
focus on data visualization.

3
00:00:15.915 --> 00:00:17.700
Data and analytics is all about

4
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.650
bringing client
challenges to life.

5
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.170
We can help clients overcome

6
00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:22.865
these challenges by taking data,

7
00:00:22.865 --> 00:00:24.605
whether structured
or unstructured,

8
00:00:24.605 --> 00:00:27.740
and turning it into
usable information and insights.

9
00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.470
Visualization is a technique
that allows us to

10
00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.530
consolidate and view data
in an illustrative manner,

11
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:34.730
to communicate a message more

12
00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.710
clearly or create a platform

13
00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.210
where we can
internalize and further

14
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.595
explore our data in
a visual format.

15
00:00:40.595 --> 00:00:43.590
Data can be displayed in
a variety of formats.

16
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.310
An effective data visualization
will help us improve

17
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.140
our ability to make
informed decisions and

18
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.720
judgments from the data
we're analyzing.

19
00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.210
Many of you may be
familiar with some of

20
00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.475
the basic types of
visualization techniques.

21
00:00:55.475 --> 00:00:58.790
For example, tables,
charts, and graphs.

22
00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.685
So how is this different than
something we already know?

23
00:01:01.685 --> 00:01:04.070
During this week, we will
discuss how to enable

24
00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.455
effective storytelling through
the correct selection,

25
00:01:06.455 --> 00:01:09.350
creation, and presentation
of tables and charts.

26
00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.150
We're going to
start by discussing

27
00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.160
data visualization basics and

28
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.125
outline basic design principles.

29
00:01:15.125 --> 00:01:17.750
We'll then go into the theory
behind how to enhance

30
00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.250
the effectiveness of
a message through

31
00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.050
the use of graphical elements.

32
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.240
There are some general
principles that apply

33
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.655
across all data
visualization projects.

34
00:01:25.655 --> 00:01:27.550
If you can master
these principles,

35
00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.240
you can significantly enhance

36
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.355
the effectiveness
of your message.

37
00:01:31.355 --> 00:01:33.710
Following these
foundational videos,

38
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.485
we will go into more detailed
charting demonstration.

39
00:01:36.485 --> 00:01:38.180
Creating graphs and charts of

40
00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.490
data visualization are
mainly used for one of

41
00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.245
two purposes, exploration
and explanation.

42
00:01:44.245 --> 00:01:45.710
This course will not cover

43
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.635
exploration or finding
the story in detail.

44
00:01:48.635 --> 00:01:50.570
At a high level, charts used for

45
00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.790
exploration support
a hypothesis driven

46
00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.070
approach and work to
discover something than

47
00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.730
the data that was not
previously known or confirmed.

48
00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:59.710
Instead, during this week,

49
00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.535
we will focus on charts
with the purpose of

50
00:02:01.535 --> 00:02:04.775
explanation or telling
the story of the data.

51
00:02:04.775 --> 00:02:06.650
We're going to show
you how to build

52
00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.680
five common graphs that
we often use here at PWC.

53
00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.520
Column graphs,
100 percent stacked charts,

54
00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.535
combo graphs, heat maps
and Gantt charts.

55
00:02:15.535 --> 00:02:18.560
We will review how to select
which one is appropriate

56
00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.410
for a given purpose and how
to use them most effectively.

57
00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:22.760
Like the previous weeks,

58
00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.050
we will be using Excel as

59
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.470
the platform for
creating these graphs.

60
00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.370
It is important to
note that there

61
00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:29.870
are systems and
graphing platforms

62
00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.700
available for data visualization

63
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.755
which are much more
extensive than Excel.

64
00:02:33.755 --> 00:02:36.320
This course will not cover
how to use these platforms.

65
00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.050
However, they are certainly
worth exploring after you've

66
00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.760
gained an understanding
of the foundations

67
00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.230
of data visualization.

68
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:43.520
It is important to know

69
00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.710
the design principles
you'll be exploring can be

70
00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.360
applied in infinite ways across

71
00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.765
many different charts,
graphs, and visuals.

72
00:02:49.765 --> 00:02:52.790
It's up to you to figure
out how to best use them.

73
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.410
By the end of this week,
you will be able

74
00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.000
to select and build charts that

75
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.605
will effectively tell your story

76
00:02:57.605 --> 00:02:59.725
and further internalize data.

77
00:02:59.725 --> 00:03:02.435
We're seeing that data
and analytics today is

78
00:03:02.435 --> 00:03:04.910
underpinning every kind
of business challenge.

79
00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.770
Being able to visualize data in

80
00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.440
a meaningful way allows you
to present an analysis,

81
00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.380
so that anyone can understand
what the information means.

82
00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.320
Enjoy the lessons and
exercises presented this week.

83
00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.820
I'll be back at
the end of the week.
