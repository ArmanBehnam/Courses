2
00:00:05.018 --> 00:00:08.990
In this section, we're going to
demonstrate the Power View feature.

3
00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:14.214
Power View is an interactive data
exploration, visualization and

4
00:00:14.214 --> 00:00:19.816
presentation experience that
encourages intuitive ad hoc reporting.

5
00:00:19.816 --> 00:00:24.481
In simple English, Power View is an Add-in
that enhances Excel's ability to create

6
00:00:24.481 --> 00:00:27.060
dynamic data visualization.

7
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.110
It can be used to quickly create
a variety of visualizations from tables

8
00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:38.370
to matrices to pie, bar, and bubble
charts, maps, and many other options.

9
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.220
It was introduced in Excel 2013 and
we have included instructions on

10
00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.570
how to enable it or install Power View
in older versions of Excel.

11
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.555
The sales team is looking to get a better
understanding of the destinations that

12
00:00:53.555 --> 00:00:55.372
are generating the most revenue.

13
00:00:55.372 --> 00:00:59.810
They have asked you to analyze the sales
data and draw some conclusions.

14
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.893
You have decided that being able to
visually demonstrate the distribution of

15
00:01:03.893 --> 00:01:07.347
the revenue across the destinations
will help the sales team draw

16
00:01:07.347 --> 00:01:09.660
interesting conclusions.

17
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:14.380
We could, of course, use a column chart
and pop the sales across different regions

18
00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.290
but Power View allows us to
do something even better.

19
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:23.204
Using the Excel Power View feature,
it is possible to create a chart showing

20
00:01:23.204 --> 00:01:27.315
the sales revenue on top of
a map of the United States.

21
00:01:27.315 --> 00:01:31.845
This is going to allow the sales team to
easily determine the geographic dispersion

22
00:01:31.845 --> 00:01:33.435
of the ticket sales and

23
00:01:33.435 --> 00:01:36.365
discover any destinations where
sales are underperforming.

24
00:01:37.945 --> 00:01:42.585
Let's start by taking a look at the Sales
Data tab where we find the data that

25
00:01:42.585 --> 00:01:45.430
was provided by the sales team.

26
00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.915
As you can see,
we have been given the flight ID,

27
00:01:48.915 --> 00:01:53.677
the route information, aircraft ID,
average ticket price, and

28
00:01:53.677 --> 00:01:58.114
total fare, as well as information
on the date of the flight.

29
00:01:58.114 --> 00:02:02.666
Since we want to create a visual
representation of the revenue distribution

30
00:02:02.666 --> 00:02:07.645
across the nation, we're going to be using
columns D, which contains the arrival

31
00:02:07.645 --> 00:02:11.430
airport, as well as column G,
which contains the total fare.

32
00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:18.570
First, let's ensure that Power View
is enabled for 2013 Excel users.

33
00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.993
If you have an older version of Excel,

34
00:02:20.993 --> 00:02:26.090
please refer to the reading on how to
download, install and enable Power View.

35
00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.430
In order to activate this feature,
we're going to navigate to the File tab

36
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:37.110
on the ribbon and select Options
from the menu on the left hand side.

37
00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.440
This brings up the Excel Options window.

38
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.060
Next, we navigate to
the Add-ins category and select

39
00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.060
COM Add-ins from the Manage drop-down
menu at the bottom of the window.

40
00:02:52.518 --> 00:02:53.370
Click the Go button to validate.

41
00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:57.284
This brings up the COM Add-ins
pop-up window.

42
00:03:00.388 --> 00:03:04.476
Which is where we're going to
select the Microsoft Power View for

43
00:03:04.476 --> 00:03:07.161
Excel option and then click OK to confirm.

44
00:03:09.262 --> 00:03:12.510
We also want to make sure
macros have been enabled.

45
00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.710
To do this, lets navigate back to the File
tab in the ribbon and select Options.

46
00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.990
This time we're going to select Trust
Center from the menu on the left hand side

47
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:24.710
followed by Trust Center Settings.

48
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.134
This brings up a new pop-up window.

49
00:03:28.134 --> 00:03:32.350
We're going to navigate to
the Macro Settings category.

50
00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.212
Here, we're going to select
the Enable all macros option and

51
00:03:38.212 --> 00:03:41.080
then we click OK to close this window.

52
00:03:42.422 --> 00:03:45.686
Finally, we'll need to make sure that
Power View is included in the ribbon.

53
00:03:45.686 --> 00:03:50.140
Click on Customize Ribbon.

54
00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.066
Under Main Tabs, click Insert and
then click New Group.

55
00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.890
Under Choose commands from,
click Commands Not in the Ribbon.

56
00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.710
And then from the list choose
Insert a Power View Report.

57
00:04:07.865 --> 00:04:11.345
We have both the Insert
a Power View Report and

58
00:04:11.345 --> 00:04:15.290
New Group (Custom) selected and
then click Add.

59
00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:20.500
Next, we want to rename this new group so
we know what it is.

60
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.310
Click New Group (Custom) and
then click Rename.

61
00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.470
In the Display Name box, type Reports.

62
00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.882
We'll need to click OK twice.

63
00:04:34.664 --> 00:04:38.335
Now that we have activated
all of the required features,

64
00:04:38.335 --> 00:04:43.135
we will be able to see Power View
as an option on the Insert tab.

65
00:04:43.135 --> 00:04:45.740
We're now ready to create
our first Power View report.

66
00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:53.120
We start by selecting a cell in the data
table and then we navigate to the Insert

67
00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:58.470
tab on the ribbon where we find the Power
View option under the Reports section.

68
00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.680
Let's click on this button which
opens a new tab in the workbook.

69
00:05:03.538 --> 00:05:08.374
As you can see, Excel has replicated our
data table structure on the worksheet

70
00:05:08.374 --> 00:05:10.850
displaying the data as is.

71
00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:14.630
On the right side of the page we
find the Power View Fields list,

72
00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.620
which is similar to the PowerPivot menu.

73
00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:23.150
Here we find the Sales Data table and
if we expand this category, we can see

74
00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:27.810
the different fields in the table, such as
the arrivals airport and the total fare.

75
00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:31.700
Depending on the data in your table,

76
00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:35.690
Power View provides different
visualization options.

77
00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:40.050
Here, we want to focus only on
the arrivals airport and total fares.

78
00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.360
So let's go ahead and uncheck the other
fields in the right side menu.

79
00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:57.103
Notice how the data table updates
automatically as we remove

80
00:05:57.103 --> 00:05:59.858
the un-required fields.

81
00:05:59.858 --> 00:06:04.614
To convert our table into a different
visualization, let's navigate to

82
00:06:04.614 --> 00:06:08.985
the Design tab where we find a variety
of options including tables,

83
00:06:08.985 --> 00:06:12.870
different types of charts,
as well as maps.

84
00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:16.670
Note that Power View only enables
the visualization options that work

85
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:17.950
for the data.

86
00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:22.240
For example, if Power View doesn't
detect any numeric values,

87
00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.830
then charts are not going to be enabled.

88
00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:29.330
Similarly, if there are no geographical
locations in the data set,

89
00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:30.810
you will not be able to create a map.

90
00:06:33.134 --> 00:06:37.635
Remember, here we want to show how
the sales revenue is distributed across

91
00:06:37.635 --> 00:06:40.550
the nation, so
let's choose the Maps option.

92
00:06:43.072 --> 00:06:47.619
I encourage you to play with some of
the other options that may work better on

93
00:06:47.619 --> 00:06:50.446
different questions or
different data sets.

94
00:06:50.446 --> 00:06:54.550
Now, we see our map, but
we don't see the locations yet.

95
00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:58.090
In order to add the arrival airports
to the map, let's go ahead and

96
00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:02.490
click on that field in the list on
the right side of the window and drag and

97
00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:05.430
drop it into the Locations
field further down below.

98
00:07:08.232 --> 00:07:12.580
Next, we want to make sure that we
remove all of the different colors.

99
00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:16.320
So under the Color field on
the right hand side of the window

100
00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:20.970
we're going to click on the down arrow and
select the Remove Field option.

101
00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:26.680
As you can see, we now have a map
of the US with a circle over

102
00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:30.600
each of the arrival airports
representing the quantity of sales.

103
00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:37.010
We can see that the airline sales revenue
is distributed across the larger US cities

104
00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:41.690
and that there's a high concentration of
sales revenue in the Eastern corridor.

105
00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:53.493
As you can see, the Power View
function can be a very useful and

106
00:07:53.493 --> 00:07:56.280
intuitive tool to visually depict data.

107
00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:06.899
