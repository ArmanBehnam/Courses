00:00:11.163 --> 00:00:13.818
Hello and welcome back,
I'm Halden Williams.

3
00:00:13.818 --> 00:00:17.990
In this video, I'm going to review some
academic theory that can help us better

4
00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.715
understand how to develop effective
data visualizations in Excel or

5
00:00:21.715 --> 00:00:24.000
across other tool sets.

6
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.510
As we've previously discussed,
effective data visualization

7
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.370
helps an audience analyze, understand, and
draw conclusions from summarized data.

8
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:34.970
Building on the principles
from our previous lesson,

9
00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.780
let's add the following
recommendations for charting.

10
00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.650
Less is more, your chart should
convey one message to your audience.

11
00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.850
Communicating multiple concepts usually
results in tradeoffs in clarity.

12
00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.300
Use titles and labels to give your
audience an understanding of your message.

13
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.050
You want your audience spending their time
exploring and thinking about your message

14
00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:58.482
and the underlying data, not orienting
themselves to what they're looking at.

15
00:00:58.482 --> 00:01:02.129
Use call-outs to highlight key messages
and direct the audience to findings.

16
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.160
Use color intentionally and
not for decorative purposes.

17
00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.220
Less color is often better, this is
consistent with a fundamental principle

18
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.390
we discussed in an earlier video.

19
00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.890
Understand constraints of your medium, how
will this graph be presented or printed.

20
00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.330
If our visualization is printed in black
and white will that change the message?

21
00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.710
One of the academic pioneers in data
visualization coined the term chart junk

22
00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.180
to refer to any nonessential
information added to a chart.

23
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.610
A good test for your chart's effectiveness
is to try and remove an element from your

24
00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.370
chart and assess if your audience
will still understand your message.

25
00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.100
If they can, you should remove it.

26
00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.830
Let's see if we can improve
the effectiveness of the example chart

27
00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.520
by applying some of our new concepts.

28
00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.420
Before we start, let's review
the message we're trying to convey.

29
00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.850
This chart should communicate that Chicago
is the third most populous city in

30
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:54.660
the country in 2016.

31
00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.120
On the screen we have a bar chart for

32
00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.920
the population of major US cities,
in its current form,

33
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.710
the chart makes it much more difficult
than it should be to answer this question.

34
00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.030
Let's see what we can do to make this
graph more intuitive to the reader.

35
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:16.750
To start, let's make all the bars the same
color, applying the concept of similarity.

36
00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.280
There is no immediate benefit to
have each bar a distinct color so

37
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.330
changing them all to the same color
makes it easier for us to look at.

38
00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.870
Next, let's examine the Y axis and
data labels.

39
00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.350
Do we need both?

40
00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:34.270
Probably not, furthermore, is there a
benefit in having the exact population for

41
00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:35.270
each bar?

42
00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.198
Or would it be to use some rounding here?

43
00:02:37.198 --> 00:02:41.930
Let's try rounding to the nearest
100,000 for data labels and

44
00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.240
remove the Y axis label.

45
00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.360
This looks better, however we've removed
the scale and added rounded values.

46
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.725
So we need to ensure our
audience is aware of the scale.

47
00:02:50.725 --> 00:02:52.969
We'll revisit this when
we update the title.

48
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.320
Now that we have data values and
no Y axis, let's remove the grid lines

49
00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.540
as they no longer provide
any benefit in this example.

50
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.900
If your chart does require grid lines we
recommend using a light gray instead of

51
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.970
black as a grid line should not
be the focal point of the chart,

52
00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.160
rather a guide to helping
the reader interpret the results.

53
00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.890
This charts looking better already,
let's see what else we can do.

54
00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.960
The order of the bars is
currently alphabetical by city.

55
00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.370
Let's change the order so the cities
are organized by population instead of

56
00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.030
alphabetically, as well as flipping our
chart orientation so it's easier to read.

57
00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.310
Great, now that we've updated
the order of the cities,

58
00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.559
let's review the title of the chart.

59
00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.290
Population's not a complete title and

60
00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.400
doesn't help the audience
understand what are looking at.

61
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.980
We can be more specific,

62
00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.580
the title of the chart should convey
the primary conclusion succinctly.

63
00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.167
Let's update the title to read, Chicago
is the third largest US city, 2016,

64
00:03:46.167 --> 00:03:47.880
(population in millions).

65
00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.270
There are few more elements
we can eliminate and

66
00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.039
change around before
this graph is finalized.

67
00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.510
Let's get rid of the border as it's
not contributing to the story.

68
00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.900
The final touch will be to
highlight the focus of our message.

69
00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.470
Since we are focusing on Chicago,
let's use the anomaly principle and

70
00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:05.770
make that bar a different color.

71
00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.960
And there you have it,
a much more effective graph.

72
00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.269
Let's compare this to where we started.

73
00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:15.330
You can see how we put some of
the charting concepts to work.

74
00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:19.360
Telling a better story and
removing non-essential chart elements.

75
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.820
Similar principles can
be applied to tables,

76
00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.370
as they're just a different
type of visualization.

77
00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.410
Many times, a table can more elegantly
convey the primary components of

78
00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:33.190
a data story without the added
distraction of needless visual elements.

79
00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.491
Tables need to be a legible as possible,

80
00:04:35.491 --> 00:04:39.839
some characteristics of a legible table
are displayed in this comparison.

81
00:04:39.839 --> 00:04:43.761
Banded rows or columns allow for
easier distinction when matching and

82
00:04:43.761 --> 00:04:45.497
reading across information.

83
00:04:45.497 --> 00:04:49.345
Cell padding or adding a slight margin and
evenly distributing columns

84
00:04:49.345 --> 00:04:53.780
when appropriate creates more space for
the reader, and enhances readability.

85
00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.862
Creation of table should
follow similar fundamental

86
00:04:57.862 --> 00:05:00.530
principles applied when
you're creating charts.

87
00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:04.423
Data in tables should be organized in a
logical order based on the message you're

88
00:05:04.423 --> 00:05:05.720
trying to convey.

89
00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:10.290
And where appropriate round to allow for
easier comparison.

90
00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:11.860
Now that we have seen effective charts and

91
00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.649
tables, let's review some
classic charting mistakes.

92
00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:20.270
In the first example, using a pie chart
when the data points are very similar.

93
00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.940
It is difficult to draw a conclusion
from a pie chart with many slices

94
00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.800
as we cannot easily
understand the variability.

95
00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.930
An example of chart junk that should
be eliminated are charts with a third

96
00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:32.700
dimension that communicate no information.

97
00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:36.650
Another problem with a third dimension is
that it can skew the perception of viewer,

98
00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:38.900
which should not be your intention.

99
00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.930
Last and perhaps most importantly,
often times pie charts do

100
00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:47.060
not convey conclusions which cannot
be effectively drawn from a table.

101
00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:49.610
Further to the topic of
skewing data presentation

102
00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:53.320
inaccurate scaling is another common
theme in ineffective charting.

103
00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:56.850
It is important to remain consistent
while you're using a scale.

104
00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:00.010
In this example, we can see how
the difference being called out is

105
00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:03.440
grossly exaggerated with
the inaccurate scale on the left.

106
00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.700
These two graphs show the same bars, but

107
00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:08.620
clearly biased
representations of the data.

108
00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.600
This is often referred
to as the lie factor.

109
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:15.270
Infographics can also be guilty
of the same inaccurate scaling,

110
00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:18.980
differences in width and height that are
often results in visuals such as this one

111
00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:20.882
are misleading to the reader.

112
00:06:20.882 --> 00:06:24.660
While infographics are more interesting
to look at it's important to consider how

113
00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:26.548
the message is coming across.

114
00:06:26.548 --> 00:06:30.202
One final common mistake in ineffective
charting is poor, missing labels

115
00:06:30.202 --> 00:06:34.310
while it's unlikely you would create
a chart with no labels at all.

116
00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:37.820
It is common to see a title or
axis label missing.

117
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:41.470
Without this information the the audience
is forced to make assumptions,

118
00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:43.850
some of which maybe correct,
some which maybe not.

119
00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:48.270
Similarly ineffective is
including labels which are so

120
00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:52.150
disconnected from the visualization itself
that they require multiple interpretation

121
00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:53.880
steps to understand.

122
00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:57.220
Take the guessing out of it and
use all necessary labels,

123
00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:01.600
placed ideally as close to the value
they are associated to as possible.

124
00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.450
This will also help ensure the reader is
getting the message you are trying to

125
00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:06.800
convey without having
to exert undue effort.

126
00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:11.520
The next videos in the course will move on
to the details of how to create some of

127
00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:15.450
these charts, applying the principles
discussed, and rules of effective and

128
00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:16.760
ineffective charting.

129
00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.010
During the remainder of this week,

130
00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:21.600
the courses will go through how
to build visualizations in Excel.

131
00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:25.380
As we do this, keep in mind the more
advanced environments discussed earlier

132
00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:27.700
will not be covered in this course.

133
00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:31.820
Excel provides a lot of flexibility to
practice building visualization and

134
00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:35.697
serves as a foundation for
more advanced data visualizations to come.

135
