2
00:00:05.056 --> 00:00:09.840
In problem five we're going to be
looking at Gantt charts in more detail.

3
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.020
We're being asked to create a high level
project plan for a marketing campaign.

4
00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.990
There are a variety of different tools
that can be used to create a project plan

5
00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.080
such as Microsoft Project for
more complex projects or

6
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.840
a simple Word document or PowerPoint
illustration for more high level plan.

7
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.250
In this scenario,
the plan is pretty simple and

8
00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.650
could easily be represented
in a PowerPoint slide.

9
00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.340
However, the dates and

10
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.590
durations keep changing making it
hard to maintain in PowerPoint.

11
00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:44.630
So instead,

12
00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:49.310
we're going to create the project plan
game chart using Excel since it will allow

13
00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:53.200
us to easily update the chart by
simple changing the start and ending.

14
00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.730
Let's take a quick look at the data that
has been provided by the marketing team.

15
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:06.784
There are six initiatives and for each of
these, we have a start and an end date.

16
00:01:06.784 --> 00:01:10.942
The length of each initiative
is calculated using

17
00:01:10.942 --> 00:01:14.110
an Excel formula called DAYS360.

18
00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.830
Which calculates the number
of days between two dates

19
00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.800
using a 360 day financial year.

20
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.440
The percentage of completion
has been provided

21
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.100
by the marketing team in column G.

22
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.410
And then we use that percentage and the
number of days to calculate the number of

23
00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:36.220
days that have been completed,
as well as the days remaining.

24
00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.970
Now that we have a good understanding
of the data, let's go ahead and

25
00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.010
create our Gantt chart.

26
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.010
First, we're going to select
the data that we want to plot.

27
00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.090
Here that is going to be
the entire data table.

28
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:58.220
Then, we'll navigate to the Insert Tab and
go to the Charts section.

29
00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.790
If you click on the little arrow at
the bottom of that section, this

30
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.690
opens up a pop up window which provides
us with all the Excel chart options.

31
00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.530
As you can see,
there's no option for Gantt charts.

32
00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.209
Don't worry,
there's a way to get around this.

33
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.720
Let's insert a stacked bar chart instead,

34
00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.330
since this is the chart that most
closely resembles a Gantt chart.

35
00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.560
Next we'll click on
the stacked bar chart option.

36
00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:36.310
You can see this creates a graph that
is currently overlaying the data table.

37
00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.870
So let's move it down slightly so
that we can still see our data.

38
00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.470
We'll move the chart by clicking on it and
dragging it to a new position.

39
00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.190
Now, let's take a closer
look at our new chart.

40
00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.250
It has a lot of information
that makes it hard to read.

41
00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.730
The reason for this is because the data
set we selected is over-inclusive.

42
00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.160
We only really need to start date, the
days completed, and the remaining days.

43
00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.660
So, let's go ahead and
adjust the data source.

44
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.010
We're going to right click on the chart,
and

45
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.100
pick the select data
source option on the menu.

46
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.040
This gives us a pop-up window
which contains an overview

47
00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.060
of how the data has been plotted.

48
00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:31.020
First, we want to remove the percentages,
so let's select the completed

49
00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.660
percentage entry on the left side and
click the remove button.

50
00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.640
Since the total length of the initiative
is equal to the days completed,

51
00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.480
plus the remaining days,
we also don't need the length dataset.

52
00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:52.344
Let's go ahead and select this dataset
as those in the list on the left and

53
00:03:52.344 --> 00:03:54.470
click the Remove button.

54
00:03:54.470 --> 00:04:01.007
Once this is done we can close this
popup window by clicking on OK.

55
00:04:01.007 --> 00:04:04.547
Next we need to add the start
dates to our chart,

56
00:04:04.547 --> 00:04:10.310
since this will show us when each
initiative started relative to the others.

57
00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:15.002
So let's go back to
the Select data source menu,

58
00:04:15.002 --> 00:04:20.370
by right-clicking on the chart and
picking the Select Data option.

59
00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.800
Instead of removing a data series,

60
00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.940
this time we're going to add a series
by clicking on the Add button.

61
00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.010
This brings up another pop up window

62
00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.170
asking us to provide
the name of the series.

63
00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:43.755
Here that's the header of the column
which can be found in cell D9.

64
00:04:43.755 --> 00:04:47.833
Next, we need to provide
the values that we want to plot.

65
00:04:47.833 --> 00:04:51.890
Here, that is going to be the values
in the Start date column.

66
00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:57.650
So let's go ahead and
delete the current placeholder value, and

67
00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.890
then we're going to select
cell D10 through D15,

68
00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:07.310
finishing by pressing OK to validate,
adding this data series.

69
00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:12.930
We also want to start the chart
with the start data values, so

70
00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.300
we need to change the order of the series.

71
00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.770
This can be done using the arrow
buttons in the pop-up window.

72
00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:25.680
If we press the up arrow once,
we see that this start date

73
00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:30.660
series now moved to the middle between
day of completed and remaining days.

74
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.930
If we click on the arrow once more,

75
00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:38.960
we can see that the start date series
is now at the top of the list.

76
00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:44.840
Notice how the horizontal axis
label are simple numbers.

77
00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:50.180
This is why Excel is currently showing the
initiative names as well as the start and

78
00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.010
the end dates for each of the records.

79
00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:57.600
We want to change this to show just
the names of the initiatives so

80
00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:02.860
we're going to click on the Edit
button on top of the right side list.

81
00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:08.437
This brings up a pop-up prompting us to
provide the values we want to use instead.

82
00:06:08.437 --> 00:06:16.108
Here that is going to be the six different
initiative names in cells C10 through C15.

83
00:06:16.108 --> 00:06:19.960
So let's go ahead and
select those cells and then press OK.

84
00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:27.000
We're done with selecting our data series
and placing them in the appropriate order

85
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.965
so we can close this
window by clicking on OK.

86
00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:35.820
Let's stop and
think how our Gantt chart works.

87
00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:39.160
A Gantt chart shows us
a visual project plan and

88
00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.940
how the different
workstreams overlap in time.

89
00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:45.820
Essentially, we're
plotting the start dates

90
00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:49.950
as the starting point by using it
as the base of our stacked chart.

91
00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:56.140
The days completed and remaining days
will be added on top of our start

92
00:06:56.140 --> 00:07:01.260
date to show the appropriate
day that they begin and end.

93
00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:06.830
Eventually, we'll want to hide the start
date and format the horizontal axis.

94
00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:11.898
So all that is showing is the dates
completed and remaining date series,

95
00:07:11.898 --> 00:07:16.400
which together make up the total
days from start to completion.

96
00:07:18.687 --> 00:07:23.275
The horizontal axis should
reflect our start dates.

97
00:07:23.275 --> 00:07:27.551
So let's make that change
by right-clicking on

98
00:07:27.551 --> 00:07:32.674
the horizontal axis and
select the Format access option.

99
00:07:32.674 --> 00:07:39.844
In the pop-up window, we're going to
change the bounds by selecting fixed for

100
00:07:39.844 --> 00:07:43.912
the minimum value and entering 42644,

101
00:07:43.912 --> 00:07:48.100
which represents October first, 2016.

102
00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:52.322
We discuss Julian dating in course two,
but

103
00:07:52.322 --> 00:07:59.526
just as a reminder Excel shows
the date as days from January 1, 1900.

104
00:07:59.526 --> 00:08:04.464
Next, let's head to the number category

105
00:08:04.464 --> 00:08:08.698
where we're going to select date as

106
00:08:08.698 --> 00:08:13.364
the category and 3/14 as the type.

107
00:08:15.506 --> 00:08:19.790
Since we want the dates to be short
in order for them to fit on the axis.

108
00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:24.410
While we're here,
let's also adjust the units

109
00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:30.020
from 10 to 7 to show that each
grid line represents a week.

110
00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:36.189
This is more appropriate for project
plans since we don't look at a plan in 10

111
00:08:36.189 --> 00:08:38.958
day intervals but
we're going to use weeks.

112
00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:46.150
Now we have something that is
starting to resemble a Gantt chart.

113
00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:51.500
However, we still need to make the bars
for the start dates invisible.

114
00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:57.980
We do this by right-clicking on one of
the elements of the start date series,

115
00:08:57.980 --> 00:08:59.720
to bring up the formatting options.

116
00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:04.170
Let's select No fill
from the Fill color menu.

117
00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:10.070
Creating an impression of an open space

118
00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:13.610
which suddenly makes the chart
look like a Gantt chart.

119
00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:19.930
This is a perfect example of how we can
use open space to convey our message,

120
00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:22.579
something we covered in
the first part of the course.

121
00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:27.690
Now that we've made the start
dates invisible in the chart

122
00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:32.260
we should also make sure to remove
that data series from the legend

123
00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.360
since it's going to create
confusion otherwise.

124
00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:39.780
Let's click on the legend,
which selects the three legends.

125
00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:43.774
And then click in the legend for
the start dates,

126
00:09:43.774 --> 00:09:46.900
which will just select that text box.

127
00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:50.636
Now, we can press Delete
to remove it from the chat.

128
00:09:53.468 --> 00:09:57.934
Next, we're going to adjust the colors for
the days completed and

129
00:09:57.934 --> 00:10:04.310
the remaining days series, to call out
how far along each of the initiatives is.

130
00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:09.750
To do this, we're going to make the
remaining days a lighter shade of grey and

131
00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:12.429
make the days completed a darker shade

132
00:10:12.429 --> 00:10:16.714
of grey since this will make it
look more like a progress bar.

133
00:10:16.714 --> 00:10:22.620
Right-click on one of the elements
of the days completed series,

134
00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:27.058
select Fill color and
pick a darker shade of grey.

135
00:10:27.058 --> 00:10:32.892
Same thing for the remaining days,
we right-click on one of the elements

136
00:10:32.892 --> 00:10:38.084
in the series click on fill color and
pick a lighter shade of grey.

137
00:10:40.982 --> 00:10:43.522
This is starting to look pretty good.

138
00:10:43.522 --> 00:10:46.295
Now we just need to change the title,

139
00:10:46.295 --> 00:10:52.110
which we're going to do by clicking on
the placeholder and selecting the text,

140
00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:56.775
replacing it with
Airline Marketing Campaign Project Plan.

141
00:11:23.329 --> 00:11:27.613
We have successfully created a Gantt chart
representing the project plan that was put

142
00:11:27.613 --> 00:11:31.280
together by the marketing team for
their new campaign.

143
00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:34.360
If the team wants to change
one of the start or end dates,

144
00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:39.820
they can do so in a data table and
it will automatically update the chart.

145
00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:43.519
This is a very useful tool
to keep teams on track, and

146
00:11:43.519 --> 00:11:48.664
enables us to provide clear and
concise status reports of our progress.

147
00:11:48.664 --> 00:11:52.352
Now, it's your turn to practice
what you just learned.

148
00:11:52.352 --> 00:11:55.844
Go to the student workbook to
complete the next exercise.

149
00:11:58.236 --> 00:12:04.323
