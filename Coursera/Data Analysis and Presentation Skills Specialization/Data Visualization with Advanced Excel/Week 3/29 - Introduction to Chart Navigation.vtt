[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.707 --> 00:00:08.716
Let's start by taking a look at
the various Excel chart and options, and

3
00:00:08.716 --> 00:00:12.607
learning how to navigate a large
variety of features available to us.

4
00:00:12.607 --> 00:00:15.149
We're going to start with
the provided chart and

5
00:00:15.149 --> 00:00:19.000
practice making changes to it using
the basic Excel charting functions.

6
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.610
Let's start by clicking on the chart.

7
00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.710
As you can see, the data that the chart
is derived from becomes highlighted.

8
00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.630
We can also see that the chart
tools ribbon has been activated.

9
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.110
Let's take a closer look
at the chart tools ribbon.

10
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.420
The first tab in the ribbon
is the design tab.

11
00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.380
This tab contains a variety of options for
changing the way your chart looks.

12
00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.717
The charts layout section allows you to
quickly change the layout of the chart

13
00:00:52.717 --> 00:00:54.561
using pre-defined templates.

14
00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.536
The chart style section provides different
formatting options such as colors and

15
00:01:13.536 --> 00:01:14.080
styles.

16
00:01:22.911 --> 00:01:27.440
The data section allows us to manipulate
the data set that the chart is based on.

17
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.430
And the location section provides options
for moving the chart to another sheet.

18
00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.482
Together, the features in this tab
provide you with a variety of options to

19
00:01:37.482 --> 00:01:41.060
accommodate the story that you
are trying to tell with your chart.

20
00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.073
Next, on the chart tools ribbon,
we find the format tab.

21
00:01:47.073 --> 00:01:51.640
This tab provides you with a variety of
options for formatting the chart elements.

22
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.710
On this tab,
we find the current selection section

23
00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.300
that displays which chart element
has been selected for formatting.

24
00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.340
You can use the drop down menu to select
the element that you want to edit.

25
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.180
For example,

26
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.120
if we select legend, we can see that
the legend has been selected in the chart.

27
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.690
The insert shapes section
provides you with the option of

28
00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.660
inserting an object into the worksheet.

29
00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.530
Such objects can be especially useful
when you're trying to call out a specific

30
00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:23.710
data point in your chart.

31
00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.818
Let's try inserting an arrow
to point at the bar for

32
00:02:27.818 --> 00:02:30.970
New York since it's the city
with the largest population.

33
00:02:39.218 --> 00:02:43.792
The shape style section allows you to
format the chart element that is currently

34
00:02:43.792 --> 00:02:44.480
selected.

35
00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.590
You can select the quick layout option.

36
00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:50.770
Adjust the fill.

37
00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.530
Or outline color of the element.

38
00:02:56.484 --> 00:03:00.572
Change the weight or add a shadow effect,
using the shape styles section.

39
00:03:03.095 --> 00:03:08.590
The other sections in the format tab apply
differently to different chart elements.

40
00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.197
For example, WordArt applies to the text
on the graph, while the arrange section

41
00:03:13.197 --> 00:03:16.350
and size elements apply to
any shapes within the chart.

42
00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.180
Now that we have a better understanding
of the various charting options and

43
00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.130
functions available in Excel.

44
00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.760
Let's discuss the different
elements that make up a chart.

45
00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.100
There are essentially seven basic
elements in an Excel chart.

46
00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.330
The first is the chart area which
encompasses all of the other elements.

47
00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.010
When the chart area is selected,
we can easily move the chart by

48
00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.030
clicking on it and dragging it to
a new position within the worksheet.

49
00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.934
We can also resize the chart by placing
the cursor on one of the edges where you

50
00:03:52.934 --> 00:03:54.476
see three little dots.

51
00:03:54.476 --> 00:03:57.385
And once we see the arrows appear,
we can click and

52
00:03:57.385 --> 00:04:00.023
drag to resize the chart
to the desired size.

53
00:04:03.846 --> 00:04:07.260
The next element is the plot area
which contains the data points.

54
00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.860
It is possible to move and resize
the plot area within the chart area,

55
00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.110
the same way we just did for
the chart area.

56
00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:18.740
We move the plot area by clicking on it,
and

57
00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:21.590
dragging it to the new desired position.

58
00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.720
However, note that it is not possible
to place the plot area outside of

59
00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:26.703
the chart area.

60
00:04:29.476 --> 00:04:33.522
We can also change the size of this
element by selecting one of the points on

61
00:04:33.522 --> 00:04:38.345
the borders, And dragging it to resize it.

62
00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.309
The third element is the set of
data points of the data series that

63
00:04:47.309 --> 00:04:49.410
is plotted in the chart.

64
00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:53.350
In this example,
each of the bars is a data series.

65
00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:58.200
When you first click on a bar, all of
the series in that group are selected.

66
00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.710
This allows you to make
changes to all of the points.

67
00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:07.190
We do this by navigating to the format
tab, and selecting the shape fill option.

68
00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.160
We're going to change the color to gray,
so

69
00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.210
let's pick that option
from the drop-down menu.

70
00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:17.050
Now, in order to highlight the fact that
New York has the largest population,

71
00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.230
we may want to make that data
point a different color.

72
00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.590
In order to select a single data point,
we're going to click on the bar a second

73
00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:28.370
time, allowing us to makes
changes to a single object.

74
00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.600
So let's click on the bar
representing the New York population.

75
00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.120
Note how the other bars
are no longer selected.

76
00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.150
We're going to change the color to red to
have it stand out from the other bars.

77
00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:44.430
So let's go back to the format tab,
click on the shape fill option, and

78
00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:45.910
select red from the drop down.

79
00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:50.466
Notice how the data point for
New York stands out from the rest?

80
00:05:52.701 --> 00:05:57.537
The fourth element of an Excel chart
is the vertical and horizontal axis,

81
00:05:57.537 --> 00:05:59.488
along which data is plotted.

82
00:06:03.387 --> 00:06:07.612
The axes have a wide array of
formatting options available.

83
00:06:07.612 --> 00:06:09.924
For example, you can adjust the text and

84
00:06:09.924 --> 00:06:13.333
number formatting,
their positioning within the chart.

85
00:06:13.333 --> 00:06:17.644
The location of the tick marks,
the spacing between grid lines, start,

86
00:06:17.644 --> 00:06:19.880
or endpoints, and many, many more.

87
00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:23.566
The fifth element is the legend.

88
00:06:23.566 --> 00:06:26.437
The legend is an essential
element in a chart,

89
00:06:26.437 --> 00:06:30.939
since it provides an overview of
the data series that are being plotted.

90
00:06:30.939 --> 00:06:35.742
The Excel formatting options allow us to
adjust the legend sizing, positioning, and

91
00:06:35.742 --> 00:06:38.330
whether or
not it can overlap with your chart.

92
00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:43.360
For now,
we'll remove the legend since there's only

93
00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.480
one data series in this chart.

94
00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:49.387
So, let's go ahead and click on the legend
and delete it using the delete key.

95
00:06:53.196 --> 00:06:57.532
Note that we can always bring the legend
back later by selecting the legend under

96
00:06:57.532 --> 00:06:59.224
the charts elements options.

97
00:07:06.161 --> 00:07:09.070
The sixth element of
the chart is the title.

98
00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:15.040
This encompasses both the chart
title as well as the axis titles.

99
00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:20.416
Titles can be adjusted using text
formatting, sizing and positioning tools.

100
00:07:23.073 --> 00:07:27.181
The seventh element is the data labels
that help identify the details for

101
00:07:27.181 --> 00:07:29.440
each of your data points.

102
00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.550
These also have their
own formatting options.

103
00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:36.659
In this graph, only the top three
cities by population have data labels.

104
00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:41.880
We just covered the seven
main chart elements, but

105
00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:44.540
there are a few others
available to format your chart.

106
00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:49.375
There are also multiple ways to reach
the various formatting options for

107
00:07:49.375 --> 00:07:50.305
these elements.

108
00:07:51.395 --> 00:07:54.386
We use the options in the format
tab in this section, but

109
00:07:54.386 --> 00:07:57.567
you can also simply select
the element you want to edit, and

110
00:07:57.567 --> 00:08:01.975
right click in order to bring up a menu
that provides various formatting options.

111
00:08:05.623 --> 00:08:09.825
This quick overview of how to navigate
through the charting options will be

112
00:08:09.825 --> 00:08:13.705
helpful as we look at some scenarios and
see what Excel can really do.

113
00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:15.872
Throughout this course,

114
00:08:15.872 --> 00:08:19.790
we are helping you develop building blocks
that can be combined in many different

115
00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:24.100
ways to deliver solutions way beyond
what we may have demonstrated here.

116
00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:27.560
Visualization is very much an art.

117
00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:30.886
So feel free to experiment and explore.

118
00:08:30.886 --> 00:08:36.546
