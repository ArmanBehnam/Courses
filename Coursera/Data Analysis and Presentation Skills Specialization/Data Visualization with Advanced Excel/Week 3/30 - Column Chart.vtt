2
00:00:04.496 --> 00:00:08.660
In problem one, we're going to
look at how to use column charts.

3
00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.350
We're being asked to look at
routes that have had the biggest

4
00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:15.030
change in passenger
capacity in the last year.

5
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.410
Let's start by taking a look at the data
set that we have been provided.

6
00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.400
The first two columns of
the table contain the FlightID and

7
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.710
a RouteID which identify the flight and
the route flown by that flight.

8
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.880
The following two columns provide the
Passenger Volumes for both 2014 and 2015.

9
00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:39.400
We're going to use the last column
that is currently empty to calculate

10
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:45.291
the percentage change in passenger
volume between 2014 and 2015.

11
00:00:45.291 --> 00:00:49.552
The first question in this exercise
asks us to calculate the change

12
00:00:49.552 --> 00:00:51.160
percentage in column G.

13
00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:58.250
The formula to calculate this value is
going to be passenger volume in 2015 minus

14
00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:04.330
the passenger volume in 2014 divided
by the total passenger volume for 2014.

15
00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.069
So let's get started by
clicking on cell G15 and

16
00:01:08.069 --> 00:01:12.630
typing = followed by (.

17
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.530
Next, we're going to select
the passenger volume in 2015,

18
00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.220
which can be found in Cell F15.

19
00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:20.880
Then, we type minus,

20
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.630
followed by the passenger volume in
2014 which can be found in Cell E15.

21
00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.128
Now that we have the difference in
passenger volumes between 2014 and

22
00:01:33.128 --> 00:01:38.170
2015, let’s close this part of the
calculation by typing parenthesis close,

23
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.990
since we want to divide this by
the total passenger volume in 2014.

24
00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.699
Next, we type divide
followed by cell E15 and

25
00:01:47.699 --> 00:01:50.862
we close the formula by pressing Enter.

26
00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.501
We can now see that for flight number 9,

27
00:01:54.501 --> 00:01:58.810
the passenger volume increased
by 20% between 2014 and 2015.

28
00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.423
Now that we have validated that
our formula works correctly,

29
00:02:03.423 --> 00:02:07.422
let's go ahead and
copy it down the rest of the table.

30
00:02:14.664 --> 00:02:19.120
The order of the data in this table
will be replicated in a graph.

31
00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.220
Hence, we're going to want to sort
the data before creating the graph.

32
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.750
To do this,
we're going to select cell G14.

33
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.620
And navigate to the editing
section on the home tab.

34
00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.940
Next, we click on the sort and
filter button.

35
00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.570
And select sort a through z from the menu.

36
00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.620
As you can see,
the Chicago to Seattle route has

37
00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.439
experienced the largest
decrease in passenger volumes.

38
00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:49.490
Remember the charting principles
that we discussed previously.

39
00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.340
Less data helps you send
a clearer message to the audience.

40
00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.770
Our focus here is on
determining the routes for

41
00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.880
which the passenger volumes
have changed the most.

42
00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:05.150
Hence, we don't need to include the data
that is in column C, E, or F in our chart.

43
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.952
So let's go ahead and select the two
columns that we're interested in by

44
00:03:10.952 --> 00:03:15.137
holding down the Ctrl key, and
selecting the values in column D and G.

45
00:03:20.797 --> 00:03:24.682
Once the data has been selected,
we're going to click on the Insert tab

46
00:03:24.682 --> 00:03:27.940
on the ribbon, and
select the Recommended Charts option.

47
00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:34.230
From here, we select the clustered
column chart, which creates our graph.

48
00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.790
We’re going to spend some
time formatting this chart so

49
00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.110
that it conveys the message that we're
trying to share with our audience.

50
00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.400
First, let’s move the chart so that it
is no longer on top of the data table.

51
00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.430
We do this by clicking on the chart and
dragging it into the desired position.

52
00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.470
Next, we are going to change
the title of our chart

53
00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.050
to something that is more
descriptive of what is being shown.

54
00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.410
Let's click on the title,
select the placeholder text, and

55
00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:11.580
replace it with % change in
passenger volume for each route ID.

56
00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:19.080
We also want to make sure that we adjust
the positioning of the axis labels, so

57
00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:20.720
that they become legible to the audience.

58
00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.299
To do this, we're going to right
click on the horizontal axis.

59
00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.930
And select the Format Axis
option from the menu.

60
00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.830
In the Format Axis panel,
we're going to scroll down and

61
00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.920
expand the Labels category.

62
00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:40.100
Next, we click on the Label Position
drop-down and select Low.

63
00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:46.085
As you can see, the axis labels are now
below the negative outcomes making

64
00:04:46.085 --> 00:04:47.952
the route IDs easier to read.

65
00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:54.020
We are also going to add titles to
the horizontal and vertical axises.

66
00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:59.500
This is done by clicking on a chart,
going to design tab, and

67
00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.070
selecting the add chart element option.

68
00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:08.020
We click on access titles and
then we select a primary horizontal.

69
00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.160
In the primary vertical options.

70
00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:17.755
To edit the axis titles we just created,
we're going to click on the box for

71
00:05:17.755 --> 00:05:22.094
the horizontal axis title, and
replace the text with route ID.

72
00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:26.550
Same thing for the vertical axis.

73
00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.300
Let's click on the title.

74
00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.274
And replace it with,

75
00:05:31.274 --> 00:05:36.567
% change from 2014 to 2015.

76
00:05:36.567 --> 00:05:41.056
It would also be helpful to change the
colors of the bars to helps us distinguish

77
00:05:41.056 --> 00:05:45.890
between the positive and
the negative changes in passenger volumes.

78
00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:50.300
To do this we're going to click one of the
bars in order to select the data series.

79
00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.860
Now that we have selected the bars
representing the negative changes, we're

80
00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:00.490
going to bring up the format data point
panel by right clicking on our selection.

81
00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:06.886
We're going to click on the fill option
and select a shade of red from the drop

82
00:06:06.886 --> 00:06:12.092
down menu to represent the fact that
these are decreases in passenger volumes.

83
00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.816
We now have a column chart
that shows us the changes in

84
00:06:35.816 --> 00:06:41.040
passenger volumes between 2014 and
2015 across all routes.

85
00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:45.804
We can see that despite a couple of
routes losing passengers, overall,

86
00:06:45.804 --> 00:06:51.126
most routes increased their passenger
volumes between 2014 and 2015.

87
00:06:51.126 --> 00:06:57.404
