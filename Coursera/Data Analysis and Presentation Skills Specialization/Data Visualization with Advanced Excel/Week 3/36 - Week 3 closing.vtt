00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:12.338
Nice job finishing up week three.

3
00:00:12.338 --> 00:00:16.263
We hope that you enjoyed this look at
an application of data visualization.

4
00:00:16.263 --> 00:00:20.599
Data visualization allows us to use
the power of graphics to present

5
00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:24.100
information to clients in a concise way.

6
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.537
It helps us tell the story of the data.

7
00:00:26.537 --> 00:00:30.235
It helps us take vast amounts of data and
turn it into usable information and

8
00:00:30.235 --> 00:00:31.790
insights.

9
00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.320
You saw how you can use a large variety
of formats and visuals to help you and

10
00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.840
your audience make more informed
decisions and judgments.

11
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.930
We looked at principles to enable
effective storytelling through the correct

12
00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.970
selection, creation, and
presentation of tables and charts.

13
00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.290
We started off by discussion
data visualization basics,

14
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.070
outlining the theory and
concepts behind data visualization.

15
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.780
We then looked at some detailed
graphing and charting demonstrations.

16
00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.130
You also got the chance to build your own
charts to effectively tell your story.

17
00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.830
Remember, it's always important to think
about the message you are trying to convey

18
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:05.390
using the data.

19
00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.210
For example, are you trying to show
that certain metrics have improved

20
00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.130
over the last fiscal year?

21
00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.190
Or are you trying to
explain an urgent need for

22
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.690
better controls in a procurement cycle?

23
00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.520
The same data displayed differently
can produce a completely

24
00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.410
different takeaway for the audience.

25
00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:22.950
So think through your message first.

26
00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.650
We're seeing that data in
analytics today is underpinning

27
00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.790
every kind of business challenge.

28
00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.970
Being able to harness the powerful
tools we explored this week

29
00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.300
allows you to effectively visualize data
and present an analysis that anyone can

30
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.930
clearly understand what
the information means.

31
00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:40.110
Thanks for joining us.

32
00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.543
I'll be back next week to get you started.

33
00:01:42.543 --> 00:01:48.678
