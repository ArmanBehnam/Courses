2
00:00:04.012 --> 00:00:07.589
In problem two, we are going to look
at combo charts in more detail.

3
00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.711
We're being asked to analyze
the passenger volumes for

4
00:00:10.711 --> 00:00:15.095
the Chicago to Seattle route in order to
determine whether a new competitor who

5
00:00:15.095 --> 00:00:18.698
entered the market in March of
2015 has affected our sales.

6
00:00:18.698 --> 00:00:20.763
Based on the results of our analysis,

7
00:00:20.763 --> 00:00:25.151
the marketing department will be able to
decide whether or not it's necessary to

8
00:00:25.151 --> 00:00:28.782
launch an expensive marketing
campaign to retain our customers.

9
00:00:28.782 --> 00:00:32.864
We have been given a dataset with
the monthly passenger volumes

10
00:00:32.864 --> 00:00:37.033
on the Chicago to Seattle route for
both 2014 and 2015.

11
00:00:37.033 --> 00:00:41.515
Using this data, we're going to determine
whether the entry of a new competitor into

12
00:00:41.515 --> 00:00:45.450
the market in March 2015 has effected
the overall passenger volumes.

13
00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.498
To fully understand how this route has
been effected by the change of the market,

14
00:00:51.498 --> 00:00:56.059
we're going to look at the difference
in passenger volumes between 2014 and

15
00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:00.016
2015 on a monthly basis as well
as their cumulative differences,

16
00:01:00.016 --> 00:01:03.971
since this will help us understand
the net effect of the changes as well

17
00:01:03.971 --> 00:01:07.354
as reducing some of the noise
from the monthly data points.

18
00:01:07.354 --> 00:01:11.990
Let's start this exercise by
completing the fields in column K and

19
00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.409
L in the data table.

20
00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.020
We will start with the difference
from 2014 in column K.

21
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.513
Click on cell K17 and
type equals followed by the volume of

22
00:01:23.513 --> 00:01:28.528
passengers in 2015,
which can be found in cell D17.

23
00:01:28.528 --> 00:01:32.369
Now, we want to decrease this
by the volume from 2014.

24
00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.934
So, let's type minus followed by cell E17.

25
00:01:36.934 --> 00:01:41.873
As we can see, there's only a slight
increase in the volume of passengers

26
00:01:41.873 --> 00:01:45.229
between January 2014 and January 2015.

27
00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.477
Now, let's copy this formula down
the column to get the deltas for

28
00:01:48.477 --> 00:01:49.642
the rest of the months.

29
00:01:55.587 --> 00:01:59.183
We can already see that there was
definitely a change in the overall trends

30
00:01:59.183 --> 00:02:01.140
somewhere in April.

31
00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.320
The passenger volumes were slightly
higher in 2015 than in 2014 for January,

32
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.250
February and March.

33
00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.140
However, in April,
this train reversed and the passenger

34
00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.480
volumes were a lot lower than the previous
year for the remaining months.

35
00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.640
It definitely looks like the new
competitor affected our passenger volumes.

36
00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.190
So let's finish with our
cumulative difference, so

37
00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.059
that we can start plotting these values.

38
00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.155
The cumulative difference in the first
month of 2015 is going to be equal to

39
00:02:30.155 --> 00:02:31.887
difference in cell K17.

40
00:02:31.887 --> 00:02:39.403
So, let's select L17 and type equals K17.

41
00:02:39.403 --> 00:02:43.405
Now for the second month, the formula
is going to be slightly different.

42
00:02:43.405 --> 00:02:44.925
The cumulative difference for

43
00:02:44.925 --> 00:02:48.432
the current month is going to be equal
to the cumulative difference from

44
00:02:48.432 --> 00:02:52.770
the previous month plus the volume
difference for the current month.

45
00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:58.340
This means we're going to select cell
L18 and type equals followed by L17.

46
00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.066
The cumulative difference
from the previous month and

47
00:03:04.066 --> 00:03:09.580
then plus followed by K18, the volume
difference for the current month.

48
00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.683
This formula applies for
the remaining months of the year, so

49
00:03:12.683 --> 00:03:14.241
let's copy it down the table.

50
00:03:20.473 --> 00:03:23.919
As we can see, the cumulative difference
in passenger volumes went up in

51
00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:26.912
the beginning of the year, but
started decreasing in April and

52
00:03:26.912 --> 00:03:28.679
went negative the following month.

53
00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:36.511
Now that we have our data and
already see some worrying trends,

54
00:03:36.511 --> 00:03:41.176
let's focus on how we're going to
present this analysis to our audience.

55
00:03:41.176 --> 00:03:44.869
We want to create a chart that allows
us to show both monthly differences in

56
00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:49.480
passenger volumes, as well as
the cumulative difference over the year.

57
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.430
This type of data is best
shown using a Combo Chart

58
00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.160
as we discussed in an earlier video.

59
00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.910
We're going to start by selecting the two
sets of data that we want to plot,

60
00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.760
which is going to be the data in columns
K and L that we just filled out.

61
00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:08.880
Note that we're not including the route
information since this is constant across

62
00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.959
our data points and
wouldn't be adding anything to the chart.

63
00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:15.678
So let's go ahead and select the two
columns with the monthly difference and

64
00:04:15.678 --> 00:04:17.947
cumulative difference in passenger volume,

65
00:04:17.947 --> 00:04:20.404
making sure we select
the headers of our dataset.

66
00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.477
Once the data selected,
let's navigate to the Insert tab on

67
00:04:27.477 --> 00:04:31.956
the Excel ribbon where we're going to
click on the Combo Chart button and

68
00:04:31.956 --> 00:04:35.200
then click on the create
custom Combo Chart option.

69
00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.512
We want the monthly differences to
be plotted as a clustered column

70
00:04:40.512 --> 00:04:44.472
chart whereas we want the cumulative
differences to be plotted as

71
00:04:44.472 --> 00:04:47.211
a line chart to show
the trends over the year.

72
00:04:47.211 --> 00:04:50.072
The data points for
the cumulative differences

73
00:04:50.072 --> 00:04:54.865
go from positive 5,000 to negative 24,000,
but the data points for

74
00:04:54.865 --> 00:04:59.676
the monthly differences only go from
positive 800 to negative 4,000.

75
00:04:59.676 --> 00:05:02.270
So, it doesn't make sense to
plot them on the same axis.

76
00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.710
Hence, we're going to select the check
box for the secondary axis for

77
00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:07.999
the cumulative differences.

78
00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.575
Now that we have provided
all the required input,

79
00:05:12.575 --> 00:05:15.378
let's select OK to create our Combo Chart.

80
00:05:15.378 --> 00:05:19.415
We can see on this chart that something
happened in the March to April time frame

81
00:05:19.415 --> 00:05:22.671
that completely changed the trend for
the passenger volumes.

82
00:05:22.671 --> 00:05:25.661
Now the question is how
can we make it easier for

83
00:05:25.661 --> 00:05:29.349
our audience to draw the same
conclusion from this data?

84
00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:33.270
As discussed in the previous sessions of
this course, we can improve our chart by

85
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.340
formatting it to emphasis the story
that we are trying to tell.

86
00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.057
Let's start by changing
the title of the chart.

87
00:05:40.057 --> 00:05:46.287
To do this, we're going to
select the placeholder text and

88
00:05:46.287 --> 00:05:51.269
replace it with O'Hare, O-R-D to Seattle,

89
00:05:51.269 --> 00:05:56.763
SEA Passenger Variance from 2014 to 2015.

90
00:05:56.763 --> 00:06:00.435
Next, we're going to adjust
the positioning of the axis labels.

91
00:06:00.435 --> 00:06:05.960
Let's right-click on the Y-axis and
select Format Axis from the menu.

92
00:06:09.624 --> 00:06:13.508
In the pop-up window,
expand the labels category.

93
00:06:13.508 --> 00:06:17.620
Click on the label position drop-down and
select low.

94
00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:21.750
Once we close this pop-up,
we can see the adjustment.

95
00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:28.310
We also want to make sure our axis have
titles to make the chart easier to read.

96
00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:30.370
Since there are currently no axis titles,

97
00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:33.690
we're going to need to add
a chart element to our chart.

98
00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:38.682
So, let's click on our chart and
navigate to the design tab on

99
00:06:38.682 --> 00:06:43.389
the ribbon where we click on
the Add Chart Element button.

100
00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:47.763
We want to add axis titles, so
let's select that from the menu,

101
00:06:47.763 --> 00:06:53.440
then we are going to click on the Primary
Horizontal and Primary Vertical options.

102
00:06:57.943 --> 00:07:00.546
Note that this chart has
two vertical axis, so

103
00:07:00.546 --> 00:07:03.836
let's make sure we also add
the secondary vertical axis.

104
00:07:09.243 --> 00:07:12.646
Next, we are going to add
each of the axis titles.

105
00:07:12.646 --> 00:07:16.076
Lets start by selecting
the place order text for

106
00:07:16.076 --> 00:07:19.682
the horizontal axis and
replacing it with month.

107
00:07:22.658 --> 00:07:26.191
Next, we'll do the title for
the axis on the left side of the graph.

108
00:07:26.191 --> 00:07:30.707
So, let's go ahead and
select the placeholder text and

109
00:07:30.707 --> 00:07:34.656
replace it with 2014 to 2015 variants.

110
00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:47.223
Finally, let's select the placeholder text
for the final vertical axis title and

111
00:07:47.223 --> 00:07:52.671
replace it with 2014 to
2015 cumulative variants.

112
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:03.176
We're going to add data labels
by clicking on the chart and

113
00:08:03.176 --> 00:08:05.200
navigating to the design tab again.

114
00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:10.688
Let's click on
the Add Chart Element button.

115
00:08:10.688 --> 00:08:15.325
Select Data Labels and
click on More Data Options.

116
00:08:17.924 --> 00:08:22.190
As you can see, there are multiple
layer options available to us.

117
00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:27.366
We're going to select the Outside End
as the label position and

118
00:08:27.366 --> 00:08:30.207
then we close the pop-up window.

119
00:08:30.207 --> 00:08:34.713
Since the chart is kind of small,
the labels are a bit hard to read.

120
00:08:34.713 --> 00:08:38.892
So, lets make the chart slightly larger by
clicking on the border of the chart and

121
00:08:38.892 --> 00:08:40.502
using the corner to re size it.

122
00:08:46.972 --> 00:08:51.180
Generally, grid lines are not necessary
when data labels are displayed.

123
00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:51.950
So let's go ahead and

124
00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:55.270
remove them from the chart since it
will provide a cleaner look, and view.

125
00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:59.303
We're going to do this by
clicking on the graph and

126
00:08:59.303 --> 00:09:02.052
selecting the plus button
on the top right side.

127
00:09:02.052 --> 00:09:06.246
This brings up the chart elements menu
where we are going to unselect the grid

128
00:09:06.246 --> 00:09:07.107
lines option.

129
00:09:10.298 --> 00:09:13.740
Our graph answers the question
asked by the CEO.

130
00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:16.710
The entry of a competitor
into the market in March

131
00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:20.890
of 2015 clearly impacted our
passenger volumes negatively.

132
00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:26.250
This chart can now be used by the
marketing department to build a business

133
00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:29.940
case for creating an aggressive marketing
campaign to retain our customers.

134
00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:34.970
After creating a graph, always revisit
the masses that you're trying to convey.

135
00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:40.082
This graph shows the passenger
difference throughout the year and

136
00:09:40.082 --> 00:09:43.484
a bar graph, and
a commuter difference in a line graph.

137
00:09:43.484 --> 00:09:47.419
Does the graph show a correlation with
the competitor's entry into the market?

138
00:09:47.419 --> 00:09:48.942
It does.

139
00:09:48.942 --> 00:09:52.539
Remember though,
take the findings with a grain of salt.

140
00:09:52.539 --> 00:09:55.296
Though there may be a correlation,
we cannot say for

141
00:09:55.296 --> 00:09:59.510
certain that the competitor's entry is
the cause for the passenger variance.

142
00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:04.190
In this video,
you'll learn how to create a Combo Chart.

143
00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:06.821
Now, it's your turn to practice
what you just learned.

144
00:10:06.821 --> 00:10:11.660
Go to the student workbook to
complete the next exercise.

145
00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:17.095
