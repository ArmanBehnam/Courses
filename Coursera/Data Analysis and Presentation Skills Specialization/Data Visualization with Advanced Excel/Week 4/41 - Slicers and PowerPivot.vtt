1
00:00:03.944 --> 00:00:07.236
In this exercise, we're going to
demonstrate how to use Slicers and

2
00:00:07.236 --> 00:00:10.090
PowerPivot to create interactive
dashboard components.

3
00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.010
We're also going to learn how to use
form controls, the group box and

4
00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.420
other Excel tools to organize dashboard
components in a logical manner.

5
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.190
After viewing this demo, you should
understand how to link slicers to multiple

6
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:26.330
pivot tables and charts to
implement interactive dashboards.

7
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.640
We will also keep the key
principles of design in mind

8
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.440
as we build our dashboard components.

9
00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.160
Beginning in cell B68,
we have three pivot tables.

10
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.570
Number of flights, average delay and
average ticket price.

11
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.740
We're going to use these
to build our charts.

12
00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.130
As part of this exercise,

13
00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.070
we need to create a pivot chart for
each of the three pivot tables.

14
00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.060
Let's start with the flight
volume over time pivot table.

15
00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.490
First, we're going to click on
any cell within the table and

16
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.492
then navigate to the PIVOTTABLE tools tab.

17
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.300
Since data in the pivot table
we selected is a time series,

18
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.590
we're going to create a line graph.

19
00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.890
So let's go ahead and
click on the Pivot Chart button.

20
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:19.167
Select the Line option and
click OK to create the chart.

21
00:01:19.167 --> 00:01:22.723
Now that we have our chart, we want to
make sure we change the title to reflect

22
00:01:22.723 --> 00:01:24.650
the name of the data it is representing.

23
00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.210
First we select a generic
title of the chart.

24
00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:40.050
And then we put in Flight volume
over time as the new name.

25
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.977
Move the graph so it isn't covering
up any other chart elements.

26
00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.900
Next we're going to look at how to
format the chart that we just created.

27
00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.380
Let's begin by removing the extraneous
field buttons that are currently showing

28
00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.960
on the chart,
such as count of flights or month.

29
00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.720
This is done by navigating to the Analyze
tab under Pivot Table on the ribbon and

30
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.480
toggling the buttons options located
near the right of the screen.

31
00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.810
It is possible to selectively add or
remove chart elements

32
00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.550
by clicking on the chart and finding
the plus button in the upper-right corner.

33
00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.010
We're going to use this functionality and

34
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.930
remove the gridlines since this
will make the chart easier to read.

35
00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.780
First let's select the graph
by clicking on it.

36
00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.170
Next if we look in the upper-right corner,
we can see a plus sign button up here.

37
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.730
Let's go ahead and click on that button.

38
00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.820
This takes us to a menu for chart elements

39
00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.390
where we can use check boxes to
select items that we want to display.

40
00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.200
We are looking to remove the gridlines,
so let's uncheck that box in the menu.

41
00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.964
While you're here,
also choose to remove the Legend.

42
00:02:59.606 --> 00:03:02.109
As you can see,
the graph no longer has gridlines.

43
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.880
Next we're going to remove
the borders of the graph.

44
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.761
In order to do this, select the graph,
then press the CTRL key followed by

45
00:03:11.761 --> 00:03:15.015
the 1 key and
this will bring up the Format menu.

46
00:03:15.015 --> 00:03:19.136
We want to remove the border, so
let's go to the tab called Border Line and

47
00:03:19.136 --> 00:03:20.610
check the No line option.

48
00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:27.020
If we close the pop-up menu, you can see
that the graph no longer has borders.

49
00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.830
We want the primary emphasis to be
on the data elements of the chart.

50
00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.550
Which can be accomplished by making
the font color of the axis and

51
00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:40.200
title a lighter shade, much like we did
in the previous section of this course.

52
00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.690
We do this by selecting the x axis,

53
00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.720
navigating to the Home tab on the ribbon
and clicking on the Font Color option.

54
00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.690
We want to make the font lighter, yet not
so light as to become difficult to read.

55
00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.882
Let's select a shade of gray.

56
00:03:57.882 --> 00:03:59.990
Now that we have selected
a new font color,

57
00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:02.930
we need to make the same change
to the y axis and to the title.

58
00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.820
Let's select them both by
pressing the CTRL key and

59
00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.510
clicking on both items on the graph.

60
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.990
We make sure to select
the same color of gray

61
00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:19.180
under the font color option
that we chose for the x axis.

62
00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.630
We've now formated our chart and

63
00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.440
have successfully kept
the design principles in mind.

64
00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:25.680
As you can see,

65
00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.520
we've created and formatted an additional
two pivot chart for the average delay and

66
00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.380
average ticket price pivot tables using
the same methods we just discussed.

67
00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.100
Now that all three charts have
been created and formatted,

68
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.570
it is time to create a slicer.

69
00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.440
We start by clicking on any cell
in one of the pivot tables.

70
00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.388
And then we are going to navigate to
the PIVOTTABLE tools tab where we click on

71
00:04:49.388 --> 00:04:53.660
the Insert Slicer option that can
be found in the filter section.

72
00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:57.690
Next, we select the Route
from the Flights table.

73
00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.605
From the Insert Slicers window,

74
00:05:00.605 --> 00:05:03.482
click on the Route check box
within the Flights table.

75
00:05:08.467 --> 00:05:11.278
To minimize the number of
elements on the dashboard,

76
00:05:11.278 --> 00:05:16.050
we want a single slicer with the ability
to filter each of the pivot charts.

77
00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.120
To accomplish this, we need to connect
the slicer to each of the pivot charts

78
00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.360
that were previously created.

79
00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.410
In order to do this, we're going to start
by right-clicking on the slicer and

80
00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:30.230
then selecting
the Report Connections option.

81
00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.640
Notice that of our three pivot tables,

82
00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:37.700
the pivot table we used to create
the slicer is already selected.

83
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.144
Let's go ahead and make sure that they
have all been checked in order to

84
00:05:42.144 --> 00:05:44.532
ensure the slicer is
affecting all three charts.

85
00:05:47.487 --> 00:05:48.719
Then click the OK button.

86
00:05:50.672 --> 00:05:53.510
We would like our slicer
to have two columns.

87
00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:57.370
This can be done by right-clicking
on the slicer and choosing Size and

88
00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:59.200
Properties from the drop-down menu.

89
00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:02.990
This opens up a window on
the right-hand side of the screen.

90
00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:06.451
In order to change the number of columns,

91
00:06:06.451 --> 00:06:09.497
we need to navigate to the position and
layout section and

92
00:06:09.497 --> 00:06:13.190
click on the button to increase
the number of columns from one to two.

93
00:06:17.363 --> 00:06:21.149
As part of the principles of design
that we covered earlier in this course,

94
00:06:21.149 --> 00:06:23.491
we discussed the look and
feel of dashboard and

95
00:06:23.491 --> 00:06:27.700
how it's important to make sure that
all related objects are the same size.

96
00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:29.810
Since it will give the dashboard
a more balanced look.

97
00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.270
Let's go ahead and
resize our charts and our slicer, so

98
00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:37.090
that we can fit them next to each
other in a two-by-two matrix.

99
00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:42.186
Let's start by selecting all
the objects that we want to

100
00:06:42.186 --> 00:06:45.625
resize by clicking on each of
the objects while holding the CTRL key.

101
00:06:52.622 --> 00:06:55.458
Once we have selected the three
charts in the slicer,

102
00:06:55.458 --> 00:06:59.630
we're going to navigate to the Drawing
Tools tab and then to the Size section.

103
00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:05.770
We're going to set the height at 1.85 and
then we press Enter to confirm.

104
00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:11.857
We set the width 4.0 and
then we hit Enter to confirm.

105
00:07:16.905 --> 00:07:19.000
Note that the objects
are now the same size.

106
00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:22.460
Next we're going to arrange
the three charts and

107
00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:24.990
the slicer in a dashboard format.

108
00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:29.910
Starting with the flight volume over time
and average delay charts on the first row.

109
00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:34.080
The average ticket chart and
the slicer will be on the second row.

110
00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:38.872
We start by dragging the objects
into their approximate

111
00:07:38.872 --> 00:07:43.282
positions before using the Excel alignment
tools to finalize their positions.

112
00:07:51.304 --> 00:07:54.090
We're going to start by aligning
the first row of the dashboard.

113
00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:59.640
Let's select the two charts on this row
by clicking on them while holding down

114
00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:00.397
the CTRL key.

115
00:08:05.866 --> 00:08:09.449
Now that we have selected the objects,

116
00:08:09.449 --> 00:08:14.228
we're going to navigate to
the Drawing Tools tab and

117
00:08:14.228 --> 00:08:19.570
select the Align Top option
from the Align Tool drop down.

118
00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:25.460
We repeat this action for the second row,
selecting the charts in the slicer

119
00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:34.390
and then aligning them using the Align Top
option on the Drawing Tools tab.

120
00:08:35.910 --> 00:08:38.240
Now it's time to align the columns.

121
00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:41.945
We do this by selecting the objects in
the column, which are the first and

122
00:08:41.945 --> 00:08:42.687
third chart.

123
00:08:48.437 --> 00:08:53.890
And then select the Align Left
option on the Drawing Tools tab.

124
00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:57.820
We repeat this with the second
column to finalize the dashboard.

125
00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:03.338
Select the second chart and the slicer

126
00:09:06.325 --> 00:09:13.118
And then alight them using the Align Left
option on the Drawing Tools tab.

127
00:09:13.118 --> 00:09:17.210
We want to make sure we keep hierarchy in
mind and respect the design principles.

128
00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:20.200
So let's add a group box around
the three charts in the slicer.

129
00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:24.790
This will help the user identify
that these four items are linked.

130
00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:28.310
In order to add this group box,

131
00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:32.820
we start by navigating to the Developer
tab and clicking on the Insert button.

132
00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:38.527
Select the group box form control and

133
00:09:38.527 --> 00:09:42.769
drag it until it captures all
of the charts in the slicer.

134
00:09:50.192 --> 00:09:54.646
We also want to make sure we replace the
caption of the box with a meaningful title

135
00:09:54.646 --> 00:09:56.250
to finalize our dashboard.

136
00:10:03.441 --> 00:10:08.894
Let's call it Drilldown by
airline route using the slicer.

137
00:10:14.166 --> 00:10:18.265
As you can see, we now have a finalized
dashboard that incorporates both slicers

138
00:10:18.265 --> 00:10:22.130
and power charts to give a streamlined and
interactive tool to the end user.

139
00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:24.630
Now it's your turn.

140
00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:27.590
Practice what you've learned by
going to exercise workbook and

141
00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:29.600
completing exercise two.

142
00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:30.678
Slicers and Power Pivot.
