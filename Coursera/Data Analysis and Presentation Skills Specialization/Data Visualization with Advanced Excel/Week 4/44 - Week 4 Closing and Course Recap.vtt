2
00:00:11.155 --> 00:00:13.373
Congratulations, you've done it.

3
00:00:13.373 --> 00:00:16.499
You've now completed
Advanced Problem Solving with Excel,

4
00:00:16.499 --> 00:00:19.410
the third course in this specialization.

5
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.890
In this course, you explored Excel as
a tool for more advanced analysis and

6
00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.300
for visualizing the story
the data is telling you.

7
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.050
Along the way, you had a chance to
practice using those functions and

8
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.420
to demonstrate what you've learned
through practical exercises.

9
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.440
You started every week with an overview
from Harry Banner talking to you about

10
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.850
the topics that week and giving you
some business context to consider.

11
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.390
You saw demonstrations by
other PwC professionals and

12
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.610
had a chance along the way to
practice the functions you learned.

13
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.033
While we used Excel in this course, many
of the concepts and skills you learned

14
00:00:57.033 --> 00:01:01.516
here will apply to other tools that you'll
encounter as your career progresses.

15
00:01:01.516 --> 00:01:06.425
We always want to select the tool that
best fits the needs of the client and

16
00:01:06.425 --> 00:01:08.854
the type of analysis you are doing.

17
00:01:08.854 --> 00:01:13.344
In Week 1, we talked about guiding
principles for using Excel,

18
00:01:13.344 --> 00:01:16.050
then we looked at data and data models.

19
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.395
We introduced you to several
tools within Excel, and

20
00:01:19.395 --> 00:01:21.560
ended the week using PowerPivot.

21
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.967
In Week 2, we showed you how you can
use data to perform different types of

22
00:01:26.967 --> 00:01:30.349
scenario and simulation analyses
to limit modeling risk and

23
00:01:30.349 --> 00:01:32.750
to move away from single point analytics.

24
00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.040
You also had the chance to practice
using Solver, data tables,

25
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.400
the scenario manager, and Goal Seek.

26
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.320
In Week 3, we started to look at
how to use these core principles of

27
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.240
data visualization and dashboarding to
visualize the data and tell a story.

28
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.310
And, finally, in Week 4, you got a chance
to use Excel to build in-depth graphs and

29
00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.218
Power View reports.

30
00:01:59.218 --> 00:02:03.130
Then we combined them into dynamic
dashboards using form control,

31
00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.430
slicers, and conditional formatting.

32
00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.870
We hope you found this course
an insightful introduction to advanced

33
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:14.830
data visualization with Excel, and
that it has encouraged you to continue on

34
00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:20.090
in the data analysis and presentation
skills that PwC approach specialization.

35
00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.200
Where you will have an opportunity to
further develop and apply data and

36
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.560
analytic skills to create visualizations
and make effective presentations.

37
00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.587
Thanks again for joining us.
