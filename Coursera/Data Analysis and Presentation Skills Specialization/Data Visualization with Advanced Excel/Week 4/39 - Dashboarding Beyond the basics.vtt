2
00:00:12.203 --> 00:00:16.182
The first thing you need to think about
when creating a dashboard is your

3
00:00:16.182 --> 00:00:16.853
audience.

4
00:00:16.853 --> 00:00:18.877
What are their expectations?

5
00:00:18.877 --> 00:00:19.450
What is important to them?

6
00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.470
Before beginning with any dashboard, we
need to understand our core requirements.

7
00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.470
The key message here is to determine
the most important question or

8
00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.380
questions that the dashboard
should answer, as well as,

9
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.510
any corresponding key
performance indicator or KPI's.

10
00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.930
Remember, that all of this needs to
be approached from the viewpoint

11
00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:43.260
of the audience.

12
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.320
Next, we need to determine whether
the data is readily available, and

13
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.670
if it is, how to gather it.

14
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.970
Finally, we need to construct a key
message that shows our understanding of

15
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.470
the audience needs as well as their
technical background and knowledge.

16
00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:03.369
For example, a dashboard for a product
manager will likely have a different focus

17
00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:05.480
than a dashboard for a CEO.

18
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:10.360
The audience is going to dictate the type
of dashboard that needs to be created.

19
00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.990
Once you understand your audience, you
can move on to selecting the dashboard.

20
00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.510
There are three primary
types of dashboards.

21
00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.640
Executive, analytical, and operational.

22
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.250
Executive dashboards contain high
level information in summary form and

23
00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:31.850
usually cover a long time horizon in order
to communicate key organizational trends.

24
00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.310
We frequently see these in
general managers, CEOs,

25
00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.660
and other core executive offices.

26
00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.800
This type of dashboard can help provide
live insights into the business.

27
00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.290
And help them identify how and
where to focus their time.

28
00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.060
It can also be used to communicate
corporate performance.

29
00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.090
Analytical dashboards
are typically more detailed, and

30
00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.200
used to facilitate
further ad hoc analysis.

31
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.510
Teams use these frequently
to explore the datasets

32
00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.620
that may be too complicated to review
at the detailed line item level.

33
00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.420
Operational dashboards usually
cover shorter timeframes

34
00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.430
in order to focus on
specific operating goals.

35
00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.200
We see these frequently in operations
where they're used to measure output and

36
00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.170
other key operational KPI's.

37
00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.110
Once you have selected the type
of dashboard that you need,

38
00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.780
it's important to use
the principles of design.

39
00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.640
There are five principles that
are intrinsically linked together.

40
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.210
The first design principle is balance and
proportions.

41
00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.680
This refers to the distribution of
the visual weight of the object's color,

42
00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.270
texture, and space.

43
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.630
Essentially, how are we
utilizing both the working and

44
00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.810
the open space for
each dashboarding component.

45
00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.970
The second design principle is emphasis.

46
00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.890
Which is pretty much the opposite
of balance and proportions.

47
00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.300
This refers to how we bring attention
to what is most important or

48
00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.320
what should be read first by the audience.

49
00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:01.130
The next design principle is
repetition and consistency.

50
00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.460
This refers to how we can use
similar elements to elicit unity and

51
00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.040
consistency across the dashboard.

52
00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.150
This makes each component feel connected,
and ensures that the reader remains

53
00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.320
focused on the overall message instead of
getting lost in the individual elements.

54
00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.330
The next design principle is hierarchy.

55
00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.000
This refers to how the design
of the dashboard can

56
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.490
help the reader understand the hierarchy
of the different objects, which in turn,

57
00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:29.900
helps enforce the message
of the dashboard.

58
00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.580
As mentioned in the previous courses,

59
00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.110
data should always be used
to deliver a message.

60
00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.470
And the correct hierarchical design
can help structure the message

61
00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:38.700
more effectively.

62
00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.100
The fifth and
final design principle is functionality.

63
00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.700
This refers to the functional requirements
that need to be met by the dashboard.

64
00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.040
These requirements are typically based
on the audience and include things like

65
00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.900
having drill down capabilities to enable
the user to further explore the data.

66
00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.190
It's essential to make sure the dashboard
is functional, that there are no software

67
00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:04.500
incompatibilities with the end user and
that the navigation is intuitive.

68
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.240
These five design principles should
always be considered together and

69
00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.460
we want to make sure that we integrate and

70
00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:15.240
respect each of them as much as possible,
but without sacrificing the other four.

71
00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.110
For example, we wouldn't want to build
a dashboard that is 100% balanced.

72
00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:24.030
Since this will likely ignore
the principle of emphasis,

73
00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.980
taking away from the overall
message of the dashboard.

74
00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.490
We'll get a better feel for
these design principles, and

75
00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.920
how they are linked together,
as we look at examples of dashboards,

76
00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.940
and then start to practice
building them within Excel.

77
00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.440
To help showcase what not to
do when creating a dashboard,

78
00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:40.860
here we have a bad example.

79
00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:42.880
As you can see,

80
00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.800
it's difficult to determine which
controls refer to which graph.

81
00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.320
The color scheme crowds the dashboard and

82
00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:54.040
the chart proportions imply that revenue
by category is the most important element

83
00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.320
of the business,
which isn't necessarily the case.

84
00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:58.000
For example,

85
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.920
we might be equally interested in
seeing the revenue by category and

86
00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:06.580
the revenue by sales channel, so that we
can see the correlation between the two.

87
00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.790
In addition, the chart on
the right contains a trend line

88
00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:12.520
that doesn't seem to be
adding much information.

89
00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.420
To summarize, we risk confusing the end
user with this kind of dashboard

90
00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:20.030
because we have not guided them
through the components by using

91
00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:23.370
design principles like hierarchy and
repetition.

92
00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.260
This example shows a different way of
displaying the same data as before.

93
00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.770
This time,

94
00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.620
the principles of design were kept in
mind while designing the dashboard.

95
00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.570
Hence, the components are balanced,
logically grouped, and

96
00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:39.850
the charts contain relevant information
without extraneous gridlines and borders.

97
00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:44.180
With this view, the most prominent feature
of the dashboard are the charts, and

98
00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:46.180
they are clear and concise.

99
00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:49.860
This version of the dashboard tells
the story behind the data efficiently and

100
00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:51.400
concisely.

101
00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.640
Notice, that we have two primary
components to the dashboard, one dedicated

102
00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:00.070
to the sales channel revenue and the other
to the revenue by product category.

103
00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:02.600
Within each component,

104
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.580
we have the same design,
creating a sense of unity and balance.

105
00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:09.990
The buttons at the top allow the user
to interact with the graph and

106
00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:13.950
display the underlying data in
a variety of different ways.

107
00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:16.910
If we think back to the bad
example we just looked at,

108
00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:21.190
this dashboard clearly contains a lot
less guesswork for the end user.

109
00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:24.790
Additionally, the story reads
clearly from top to bottom and

110
00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:26.540
the components are easy to navigate.

111
00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:28.900
When building dashboards,

112
00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:32.220
it is important to think about
each of the individual components.

113
00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:36.570
When deciding on these components, we need
to ensure the key message of the dashboard

114
00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:41.220
is prominently displayed by putting
it in the highest priority position.

115
00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:43.200
As you move through
the dashboarding process,

116
00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:47.130
ask yourself, whether each component
serves a specific purpose and

117
00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:51.210
answers the key question you found
during the requirements gathering phase.

118
00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:54.920
Present metrics and measure that can
influence management decisions and

119
00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.320
policies.

120
00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:00.270
Unactionable information
should only be used sparingly.

121
00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:02.630
When you are designing and
developing a dashboard,

122
00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:06.320
it's essential to consider how it
can be maintained and updated.

123
00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:11.190
It's worth it to spend time upfront to
build enough flexibility in the dashboard,

124
00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:15.470
so that it can be updated with
new data using minimal effort.

125
00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:19.060
During the requirements gathering phase,
it's important to understand how

126
00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:23.290
often the dashboard will need to be
updated and how it will be updated.

127
00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:27.840
For example, if the data requires
frequent updates to remain relevant,

128
00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:32.020
it might make more sense to consider
building in a direct data feed that allows

129
00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:35.220
the users to update
the dashboard regularly.

130
00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:40.030
If, on the other hand, the data is pretty
static and will require minimal updating,

131
00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:43.940
it might make more sense to rely
on a manual update process.

132
00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:47.780
Remember to always include a timestamp
on a dashboard that is not updated

133
00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:52.110
dynamically, so that the audience is aware
of when the data was last refreshed.

134
00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:57.340
We also want to make sure we consider
how often our requirements might change

135
00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:58.300
going forward.

136
00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:01.590
If we expect that the requirements
could fluctuate in the future,

137
00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:04.010
we may want to leave
some functionality out,

138
00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:07.740
if we think that it could impede
our ability to make future changes.

139
00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:10.040
When you're done building your dashboard,
and

140
00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:13.990
start to think about delivering it to the
end user, always make sure to take some

141
00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:17.310
time to confirm the dashboard
addresses all the questions and

142
00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:21.220
requirements that were collected during
the requirements gathering phase.

143
00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:25.130
Review each component of the dashboard
with the key message in mind.

144
00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:29.520
This will help evaluate the dashboard
components for effectiveness and purpose.

145
00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:33.060
If the component does not serve
the high-level message, consider removing

146
00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:36.570
the component or refocusing it to
address the high-level message.

147
00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:41.260
Finally, consider how the tool
will be delivered to the end-user.

148
00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.196
Make sure that you hide everything
the user does not need to see.

149
00:08:44.196 --> 00:08:47.400
Lock anything that should not be changed,
and consider how and

150
00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:49.990
where the tool will be accessed.

151
00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:52.949
Now that we've covered
the basics of dashboarding,

152
00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:56.640
the next videos will move to
practical portions of dashboarding.

153
00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:59.570
How do you actually create a dashboard?

154
00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:01.940
As we navigate through
the practical portions,

155
00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:05.150
do not lose sight of the design
principles that we just discussed.

156
00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:09.997
Namely, how to implement the principles
in order to maintain a clear and

157
00:09:09.997 --> 00:09:13.826
concise message, and
deliver an effective dashboard.

158
00:09:13.826 --> 00:09:19.958
