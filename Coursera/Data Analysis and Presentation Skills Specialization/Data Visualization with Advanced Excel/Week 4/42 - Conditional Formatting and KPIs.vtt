[MUSIC]

2
00:00:05.834 --> 00:00:09.148
In this exercise,
we're going to demonstrate how to use

3
00:00:09.148 --> 00:00:12.256
Excel Form Controls,
Conditional Formatting, and

4
00:00:12.256 --> 00:00:16.550
IF formulas to build an interactive
Key Performance Indicator, or KPI.

5
00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.456
Not all graphics need to
be in the form of a chart.

6
00:00:19.456 --> 00:00:23.950
Sometimes an inline indicator such as a
green light can be just as informative for

7
00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:24.490
the audience.

8
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.340
After completing this exercise,
you will be able to link Form Controls

9
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.710
outputs to Excel IF formulas and
create rule based Conditional Formatting

10
00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.190
with the objective of producing
an interactive KPI feature.

11
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.182
These KPIs can be used in the dashboard to
allow the end user to quickly determine

12
00:00:43.182 --> 00:00:45.579
how the organization is performing.

13
00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:48.511
In this exercise,
we've been approached by our COO,

14
00:00:48.511 --> 00:00:52.846
who has requested a tool that will allow
him to quickly access the information for

15
00:00:52.846 --> 00:00:57.333
five strategically chosen routes, all
of which originate from Chicago O'Hare.

16
00:00:57.333 --> 00:01:01.156
The destinations he wants to focus
on are Atlanta, Los Angeles, Dallas,

17
00:01:01.156 --> 00:01:02.990
New York City, and San Francisco.

18
00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:08.280
There are two KPIs that he's interested
in, the average delay time in minutes

19
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.170
as well as the total number
of flights on the route.

20
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.510
According to the COO, the target for

21
00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.190
the average delay should
be less than six minutes.

22
00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.820
If the average delay is between six and
ten minutes, that's cause for concern.

23
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.700
Anything greater than ten minutes
is considered a major issue and

24
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.500
should be investigated.

25
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.890
The COO has direct route
managers with their own KPIs

26
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.190
focused on average delay times and
number of flights.

27
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.250
The COO would like to see how his
route managers are performing

28
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.770
against their metrics in
one easy to read graph.

29
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.690
Second, he wants to be able to cycle
through the history of their performance.

30
00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:47.960
The COO also plans to keep the output
from this dashboard on a shared drive.

31
00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.700
To ensure the underlying
dashboard does not break,

32
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.690
you'll need to secure the dashboard and
prepare it for presentation.

33
00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.990
In this excercise, one of the initial
structures has been provided in the group

34
00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.239
box, titled Average Delay and
Number of Flights.

35
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.550
During this exercise, we're going to
demonstrate how to use this information to

36
00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.380
build our KPI application that
will satisfy the COO's request.

37
00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:13.780
We're going to start by adding
a method that allows the end user to

38
00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:14.630
interact with the data.

39
00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.540
The COO needs to be able to
toggle between months and

40
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.500
years since he wants to be able to see
how the route managers perform over time.

41
00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.740
To create this type of interactivity,
we're going to add Spin buttons.

42
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.330
These are Form Controls that can
be used to increment the month and

43
00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:32.050
year as desired.

44
00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.040
Let's start with the Flight Year.

45
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.810
We want to add a Spin button that
is going to be used to update

46
00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.120
the year values in cell C35.

47
00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.400
Similar to the group box and the Options
buttons we saw in the previous exercises,

48
00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.600
Spin buttons can be found
on the Developer tab.

49
00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.180
Let's navigate to this tab and click on
the Insert button in the Control section.

50
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.199
We choose the Spin button Form Control
from the menu that appears.

51
00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.866
Next we place the Spin button
in cell D35 by clicking and

52
00:03:02.866 --> 00:03:06.337
dragging until we're satisfied
with the size of the button.

53
00:03:09.871 --> 00:03:12.752
Now that we've created the Spin button,

54
00:03:12.752 --> 00:03:18.445
we need to modify it to output values
between 2014 and 2015 in cell C35.

55
00:03:18.445 --> 00:03:24.810
The output cell has been named Flight_Year
so we can easily reference it as we work.

56
00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.560
We're going to be using this
button to change the year for

57
00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.620
which we're calculating average delay and
number of flights.

58
00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.320
Let's go ahead and
configure the Spin button.

59
00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.570
We start by right-clicking on the button,
which brings up a menu,

60
00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.440
in which we select Format Control.

61
00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:45.470
This brings up a pop-up
window with multiple tabs.

62
00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.300
We're going to click on the Control tab,

63
00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.970
since this where we can
configure the button.

64
00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.909
As discussed, we want the minimum year to
be 2014, and the maximum year to be 2015.

65
00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.590
So in the format control window,

66
00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.810
we're going to enter 2014
in the Minimum Value box.

67
00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:06.900
Next we enter 2015 in
the Maximum Value box.

68
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.660
We also need to choose the amount that
the output incrementally increases or

69
00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.440
decreases when someone clicks a button.

70
00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.430
Here we're working with years, so

71
00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.590
we're going to want to set
the incremental change to 1.

72
00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.900
Finally, we need to link the output
to a cell in our worksheet.

73
00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.653
Here that is going to be cell C35.

74
00:04:30.653 --> 00:04:34.285
Let's type that directly
into the cell link box, and

75
00:04:34.285 --> 00:04:36.874
then we click OK to apply our changes.

76
00:04:36.874 --> 00:04:40.985
Note how the value in
C35 changes from 2014 to

77
00:04:40.985 --> 00:04:44.724
2015 when we click on the Upwards button.

78
00:04:44.724 --> 00:04:47.740
Next, let's do the same thing for
the flight month.

79
00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.527
We're going to add a Spin button to
update the month values in cell C37.

80
00:04:54.458 --> 00:04:58.787
Similar to before, we're going to start
by navigating to the Developer tab and

81
00:04:58.787 --> 00:05:01.768
clicking on the Insert button
in the Control section.

82
00:05:01.768 --> 00:05:05.180
We choose the Spin button Form Control.

83
00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.130
And then we place it in
cell D37 by clicking and

84
00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:11.430
dragging until satisfied
with the size of the button.

85
00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.421
The Spin button is going to be used
to output values between 1 and

86
00:05:17.421 --> 00:05:19.960
12 since it represents
the months of the year.

87
00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.290
We're going to be using this
button to change the month for

88
00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:25.060
which we're calculating average delay and
number of flights.

89
00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.270
However, the setup for the Month of Flight
button will be slightly different than

90
00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:30.790
the Year of Flight button.

91
00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:34.360
This is due to the fact that Spin
buttons can only output numerical data

92
00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.510
whereas we would like it to output
the name of the month we're looking at.

93
00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:42.100
Hence we have created a separate
worksheet called Form Control Output

94
00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.980
which will take the control output and

95
00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:49.050
use a formula to get the correct
abbreviated month displayed in cell C37.

96
00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:51.640
If we navigate to
the Form Control Output tab,

97
00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:55.840
we see that there's a table with the 12
months and their corresponding number.

98
00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:00.200
We're going to link the Spin button
output to cell B2 in this tab.

99
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.520
Then we're going to use this in
combination with the table below

100
00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.900
to calculate the corresponding month.

101
00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:11.250
Note that cell B2 is in a named
range called month_selected FC.

102
00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.670
Let's head back to the previous
tab to configure the Spin button.

103
00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.410
We select the Spin button and
then right-click to bring up the menu,

104
00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:22.510
where we choose Format Control.

105
00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:27.550
This brings up the pop-up window that
we are starting to get familiar with.

106
00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:33.460
We navigate to the Control tab and
set the minimum value to 1 and

107
00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:38.440
then set the maximum value to 12 by
typing it directly into the box.

108
00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.940
Since these numbers are going to be
representing the months and the year,

109
00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:45.699
we're going to want them
to increment 1 by 1, so

110
00:06:45.699 --> 00:06:49.670
let's set the incremental change box to 1.

111
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:53.830
Finally, we need to link the output
from the Spin button to cell B2 in

112
00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:55.360
our previous tab.

113
00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:00.140
We do this by clicking in the cell link
box then navigating to the other tab,

114
00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:04.689
clicking on cell B2, and
then selecting OK to confirm our changes.

115
00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:10.530
Now that we've established a link between
the Month of Flight Spin button and

116
00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:16.380
the Month_Selected FC-named range
on the Form Control Output,

117
00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:19.700
let's translate the numerical
output to an abbreviated month.

118
00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:24.220
To translate between the numerical
data and the text data,

119
00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:26.540
we'll use the VLOOKUP Formula.

120
00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:30.080
The reason we're using the abbreviated
month rather than the numerical output of

121
00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:34.610
the Spin button is because it gives us a
more informative output for the end user.

122
00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:37.130
Let's start by going back to
the Form Control Output tab.

123
00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:44.851
We're going to use a VLOOKUP formula in
cell C2 to look up the value in cell B2 in

124
00:07:44.851 --> 00:07:49.944
the table below and
retrieve the associated abbreviated month.

125
00:07:49.944 --> 00:07:55.538
Let's select cell C2 and
type =VLOOKUP and hit Tab.

126
00:07:55.538 --> 00:07:59.033
The first argument is
the lookup value which for us,

127
00:07:59.033 --> 00:08:01.104
is the named range in cell B2.

128
00:08:01.104 --> 00:08:03.120
So let's select B2 by clicking on it.

129
00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:06.670
Next, we need to provide the lookup array.

130
00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:10.690
Here that is going to be
the data table below.

131
00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:15.131
So let's select cells B4:C15.

132
00:08:15.131 --> 00:08:18.497
We want to retrieve the value from
the second column in the data table.

133
00:08:18.497 --> 00:08:21.190
So we'll input 2 here.

134
00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:24.720
We want only exact results,
so we'll type in FALSE, and

135
00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:27.210
then we close the formula and press Enter.

136
00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:32.310
As you can, see the formula successfully
translates the number in cell B2 into

137
00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:33.640
an abbreviated month.

138
00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:38.540
Now all that remains to be done is
linking the abbreviated month back to

139
00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:40.540
the dashboard in the tab
we were working on.

140
00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:43.460
Let's go back to the previous tab and

141
00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:46.950
select cell C37 where we want
to put our abbreviated month.

142
00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:50.280
We're going to create a direct link.

143
00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:52.490
So let's type equals, and

144
00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:57.140
then we use the cursor to go back
to the Form Control Output tab

145
00:08:57.140 --> 00:09:00.640
where we select cell C2 and
then press Enter to confirm.

146
00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:05.932
As you can see, there is now
an abbreviated month in cell C37.

147
00:09:05.932 --> 00:09:11.738
And if we click on the Spin button, we can
see how the months change accordingly.

148
00:09:11.738 --> 00:09:13.761
Moving to our calculation
of average delay,

149
00:09:13.761 --> 00:09:16.798
let's take a moment to discuss what
we're trying to accomplish for

150
00:09:16.798 --> 00:09:21.340
each cell in the first column of the table
below our newly created Spin buttons.

151
00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:24.910
As the name of the column suggests,
we want the average delay value.

152
00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:29.070
For example, in cell C40, we want to
provide the average delay for the Chicago

153
00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:33.950
to Atlanta route in the year and month
that were selected using our Spin buttons.

154
00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:37.340
We can do this by selecting
only the applicable values

155
00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:40.980
in the departure delay data table
in calculating their average.

156
00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:45.430
The conditions for selecting the values
will be based on the routes in column B,

157
00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:48.360
as well as the year and month that
can be found right above the table.

158
00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:53.600
We're going to use the AVERAGEIFS
function to select the values and

159
00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:55.270
calculate the average departure delay.

160
00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:58.810
Let's begin by selecting cell C40 and

161
00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:04.090
typing =AVERAGEIFS
followed by the Tab key.

162
00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:07.990
The first argument we need to input is
the range of values that we'd like to

163
00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:12.760
calculate our averages on, which can
be found in the Airline Flights tab.

164
00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:17.580
Let's navigate here, and
select the Departure Delays in column C.

165
00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:23.021
Next, we're going to type comma
to move to the next argument.

166
00:10:23.021 --> 00:10:27.474
Here Excel prompts us to specify
the conditions we want to be used in order

167
00:10:27.474 --> 00:10:30.325
to calculate the average
we're looking for.

168
00:10:30.325 --> 00:10:32.690
The first condition is going
to be the flight month.

169
00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:35.413
So let's go to the Airline Flights tab.

170
00:10:35.413 --> 00:10:37.302
The months can be found in column H.

171
00:10:37.302 --> 00:10:39.904
So let's select those values.

172
00:10:39.904 --> 00:10:42.630
In order to place
a condition on this column,

173
00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:45.085
we need to define a selection criteria.

174
00:10:45.085 --> 00:10:47.973
This is going to be where
our Spin button comes in.

175
00:10:47.973 --> 00:10:52.740
Navigate to the Form Control tab and
select cell B2 as our criteria.

176
00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:57.510
We also want to create a selection
based on the flight year.

177
00:10:57.510 --> 00:11:00.330
So let's go back to
the Airline Flights tab.

178
00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:03.322
The years can be found in column I.

179
00:11:03.322 --> 00:11:05.115
So let's go ahead and select them.

180
00:11:05.115 --> 00:11:06.535
Similar to the months,

181
00:11:06.535 --> 00:11:10.732
the selection criteria is going to
be the year from the Dashboard tab.

182
00:11:10.732 --> 00:11:13.640
So we go back there, and click on C35.

183
00:11:18.363 --> 00:11:21.114
The last condition is
the route of the flight.

184
00:11:21.114 --> 00:11:23.966
Let's begin by going back
to the Airline Flights tab,

185
00:11:23.966 --> 00:11:26.883
since this is where we'll
find the route information.

186
00:11:26.883 --> 00:11:27.819
As we can see,

187
00:11:27.819 --> 00:11:33.480
the data is in column B, so we're
going to select the data in that column.

188
00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:37.070
Selecting a new data set means we have
to define another selection criteria.

189
00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:41.740
Here that is going to be the route
information in column B, so

190
00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:44.790
let's type cell B40.

191
00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:46.960
We're done defining our
selection criteria, so

192
00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:49.240
we're going to close the formula and
press Enter.

193
00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:54.180
As you can see, the formula is giving
us a value that seems to be accurate.

194
00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:56.221
We want to do the same thing for
the other four routes.

195
00:12:00.246 --> 00:12:04.622
And since we used the named ranges in the
formula we can just copy the formula down

196
00:12:04.622 --> 00:12:05.285
the table.

197
00:12:05.285 --> 00:12:09.607
Next let's apply Conditional Formatting to
the average delay values so the audience

198
00:12:09.607 --> 00:12:14.410
can very quickly decide whether or
not the route is meeting the desired goal.

199
00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:17.010
First, we're going to select
the cells where we want to apply

200
00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:18.200
the Conditional Formatting.

201
00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:23.019
Here that is going to be cells C40:C44.

202
00:12:23.019 --> 00:12:27.170
Next we click on the Conditional
Formatting button in the Home tab.

203
00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:28.637
If we go to Icon Sets,

204
00:12:28.637 --> 00:12:33.370
another menu appears that allows us
to select the More Rules option.

205
00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:37.340
This brings up a pop-up window
where we are going to choose

206
00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:40.750
the Format All Cells Based
on their Values Option.

207
00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:46.390
We're also going to select the Reverse
Icon Order button because for our

208
00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:50.579
COO's purpose, the higher the number is,
the further we are from meeting our goals.

209
00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:55.080
Remember how the COO had set targets
of less than six minutes for

210
00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:56.720
the averages departure delay?

211
00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:00.260
We're going to use these metrics to
format ourselves, based on whether or

212
00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.980
not they meet the goals
established by the COO.

213
00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:09.860
For the red light value, we're going
to change the type to number, and

214
00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:12.550
enter 10 as the value, then hit Enter.

215
00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:17.140
This represents a failure
since the COO said he'd be

216
00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:20.830
highly concerned if the average
departure delays exceed ten minutes.

217
00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:26.020
For the yellow light,
change Type to Number again and

218
00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:28.730
enter 6 as the value, then hit Enter.

219
00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:32.410
This means that any value
that is greater than or

220
00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:35.600
equal to 6 but
less than 10 will produce a yellow light.

221
00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:39.780
We don't need to change anything for
the green light.

222
00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:44.350
But notice that now anything less than
six will produce a green light which

223
00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:50.330
corresponds to meeting or exceeding
the target metrics established by the COO.

224
00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:51.890
Click OK to validate our changes.

225
00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:57.310
Similar to the average delay calculations,
we're now interested in the number of

226
00:13:57.310 --> 00:14:00.110
flights for
each route given a month and year.

227
00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:04.970
The formula setup we used for COUNTIFS is
nearly identical to that of AVERAGEIFS,

228
00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:07.210
except we no longer have an average range.

229
00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:10.090
Let's begin by selecting cell D40.

230
00:14:12.983 --> 00:14:16.775
Type =COUNTIFS( and hit the Tab key.

231
00:14:16.775 --> 00:14:19.862
The first condition is the Flight Month.

232
00:14:19.862 --> 00:14:24.974
Navigate to the Airline Flights tab,
click cell H2.

233
00:14:24.974 --> 00:14:30.920
Then on the keyboard, Ctrl+Shift+Down
to select the Flight Month column.

234
00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:32.890
Type comma.

235
00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:36.110
To condition on this column,
we need a value.

236
00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:40.720
Type Month_SelectedFC,

237
00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:44.550
which is the named range which holds
the Flight Month Spin button output.

238
00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:47.010
Type comma.

239
00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:50.780
The next condition is Flight Year.

240
00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:54.796
Click cell I2, then on the keyboard,

241
00:14:54.796 --> 00:15:00.403
Ctrl+Shift+Down to select
the Flight Year column.

242
00:15:00.403 --> 00:15:05.109
Again, we need a value to
match against this range.

243
00:15:05.109 --> 00:15:10.400
This time, we're going to use
the output from the Flight Year

244
00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:14.486
output which is a named range,
flight_year.

245
00:15:14.486 --> 00:15:19.510
Type flight_year and
a comma to move to the next argument.

246
00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:22.770
The last condition is
the route of the flight.

247
00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:26.650
We need to select the Route column.

248
00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:32.170
Click cell B2, and then on the keyboard
Ctrl+Shift+Down and type a comma.

249
00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:39.420
Finally, select cell D40,
close parentheses, and hit Enter.

250
00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:43.867
The number returned as a result
is the number of flights for

251
00:15:43.867 --> 00:15:47.056
Chicago to Atlanta in April, 2014.

252
00:15:47.056 --> 00:15:52.347
Hover over the lower right-hand corner
of cell B40 until you see a crosshair.

253
00:15:52.347 --> 00:15:55.640
Double-click on the crosshair to copy
the formula down for the remaining routes.

254
00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:01.160
Next, let's apply Conditional Formatting
to the Number of Flights values so

255
00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:03.420
the audience can quickly
compare between routes.

256
00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:07.020
Before we get started with formatting,

257
00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:11.420
let's also place the results in the cells
adjacent to the number of flights.

258
00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:16.700
We want to do this because we're going
to place data bars in column E, but

259
00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:18.300
we only want the bars to be visible.

260
00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:22.530
Type = in cell E40.

261
00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:24.608
Then click cell D40.

262
00:16:24.608 --> 00:16:25.471
Hit Enter.

263
00:16:27.049 --> 00:16:32.060
Hover over the lower right-hand corner
of cell E40 until you see a crosshair.

264
00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:36.226
Double-click the crosshair
to copy the formula down.

265
00:16:36.226 --> 00:16:40.105
Next select E40 to E44.

266
00:16:40.105 --> 00:16:44.063
Click the Conditional Formatting
button on the Home tab and

267
00:16:44.063 --> 00:16:46.766
hover over Data Bars from the drop down.

268
00:16:46.766 --> 00:16:50.037
Select more rules from
the pop-up window and

269
00:16:50.037 --> 00:16:54.190
choose Format cells based on their values.

270
00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:57.120
Next, check the Show Bar Only box.

271
00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:02.510
Change the fill color using
the color drop-down and click OK.

272
00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:06.860
The reason we have our data in column
D and our formatting in column E

273
00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:11.240
is because the data bars can
overshadow the data, and vice versa.

274
00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:15.340
So separating makes each element
more clear and effective.

275
00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:19.168
Before we finish, let's check to make
sure our controls and formulas work.

276
00:17:19.168 --> 00:17:21.950
Change the flight month using
the Form Control and the formulas and

277
00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:23.698
Conditional Formatting should change.

278
00:17:26.971 --> 00:17:30.690
In this section we used Excel Form
Controls, Conditional Formatting, and

279
00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:33.900
IF formulas to build an interactive
Key Performance Indicator.

280
00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:37.223
Now it's your turn.

281
00:17:37.223 --> 00:17:42.478
