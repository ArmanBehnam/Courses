00:00:10.838 --> 00:00:14.758
In this video I'm going to give you a high
level introduction to dashboarding.

3
00:00:14.758 --> 00:00:19.276
We are going to look at how and why we
use dashboards and the overall benefits.

4
00:00:19.276 --> 00:00:20.854
So, why dashboard?

5
00:00:20.854 --> 00:00:25.060
In my welcome video I introduced one
of the key reasons for dashboarding.

6
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.550
Dash boarding allows the user to quickly
focus on the most important aspects of

7
00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.420
a dataset using the principles of
visualization and data modelling.

8
00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.923
In many ways this is the combination
of modules one, three, three.

9
00:00:35.923 --> 00:00:39.421
Dashboarding, similar to data
visualization, is both an art and

10
00:00:39.421 --> 00:00:40.890
a science.

11
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.750
There’s some key principles and design
considerations that should be followed.

12
00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.120
However, creating a perfect dashboard
requires as good understanding of the data

13
00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.290
and how the variables interconnect.

14
00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.820
You might be thinking,
I run a monthly report and

15
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.830
send it to my manager,
the report has all the facts they’ll need,

16
00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.440
why create a dashboard and
how is this different from reporting?

17
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.660
The answer to this is that dashboards
provide focused information

18
00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.590
in a visually appealing way, which allows
the audience to quickly get a sense for

19
00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.270
the data as a whole.

20
00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.280
Reports mainly consist of
tables of numerical data,

21
00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.580
which are great if you need to
reference an individual figure.

22
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.980
However, reports don't allow the audience
to quickly view the relationships in

23
00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.900
the data or to observe trends.

24
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.820
Dashboards focus on important areas and
accentuate them with visualizations and

25
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.630
Key Performance Indicators, or KPIs,
to facilitate better decision making.

26
00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.210
How are dashboards used
in a business setting?

27
00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.780
Dashboards provide quick views in
the performance of an organization

28
00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.820
are used for day-to-day decision making
and management across the company.

29
00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.950
We frequently see them
on operations floors,

30
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.250
where they are used to highlight KPIs.

31
00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.520
But now we're also starting to see them in
the back office, where they help provide

32
00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.410
transparency to areas, such as closing
the books at the end of the month.

33
00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.110
Let's talk about some of
the benefits of dashboarding.

34
00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.880
First and foremost, the dashboarding
decreases the time spent by the audience

35
00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.310
by deciphering and analyzing the data.

36
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.620
This means that they can spend more
time understanding how the business is

37
00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.520
performing and also allows for
quicker decision making.

38
00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.740
Dashboarding can also help
focus the conversation on areas

39
00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.350
that might require additional and
more targeted analysis.

40
00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.880
As a less conventional example,
we recently created a dashboard for

41
00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.590
a legal client that needed to continuously
see a quick snapshot of the evidence

42
00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.010
collected and processed to date and
ever-changing fraud investigation.

43
00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.470
The dashboard provided the client
a variety of statistics, including

44
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.340
the number and location of hardware
that had been forensically imaged,

45
00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.280
preserved, and what was still outstanding.

46
00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.270
It also provided the client with
information on the various interviews that

47
00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.640
had been conducted and
summaries of the results.

48
00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.750
The dashboard was a key factor in
helping the client quickly digest

49
00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.090
the facts around the case and understand
the remaining work that needed to be done.

50
00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.920
In the next video,

51
00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.620
my colleague will introduce you to some
key design principles to guide you and

52
00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.550
help you create effective and
informative dashboards.

53
00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.900
They'll also go over some general
guidelines on how to update dashboards

54
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:02.760
once they are created.

55
00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.208
I've enjoyed introducing this
analytical concepts to you and

56
00:03:07.208 --> 00:03:09.483
wish you success in your future endeavors.

57
00:03:09.483 --> 00:03:15.175
