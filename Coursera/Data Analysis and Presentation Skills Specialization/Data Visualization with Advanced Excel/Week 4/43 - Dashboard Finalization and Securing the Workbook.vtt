2
00:00:05.952 --> 00:00:10.072
Now that we have the elements for our
dashboard built, let's combine them into

3
00:00:10.072 --> 00:00:14.192
one executive dashboard for the COO which
can be displayed on a touch monitor and

4
00:00:14.192 --> 00:00:16.919
also ensure it meets their
original requirements.

5
00:00:18.365 --> 00:00:21.380
To accomplish this, we're going to show
you how to bring together the various

6
00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.520
dashboard components you have produced in
the preceding sections of this module.

7
00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.020
We're also going to learn how to use the
Camera tool and how to hide elements of

8
00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.960
Excel's user display to present
the user with a clean dashboard.

9
00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:38.240
In many situations it is preferable to
present the user with only the required

10
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.680
information and interaction capabilities
necessary to interact with the dashboard

11
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.250
in ways intended by the designer.

12
00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.170
You have performed some very interesting
technical steps to complete your

13
00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:49.420
dashboard.

14
00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.070
But we want something that is easy
to read and easily digestible.

15
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.090
So unfortunately we're going to
hide many of the components that

16
00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.540
the user does not need to see.

17
00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.020
Think about how clean our Dashboard will
look on the touch monitors without all

18
00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.800
the Excel clutter.

19
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.620
Before we finalize the Dashboard, we need
to consolidate elements we are interested.

20
00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.610
We are going to use the camera tool,
in which we need to add.

21
00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.330
The camera tool allows you to
take a dynamic snapshot of

22
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.260
a part of the worksheet and
place it elsewhere in the workbook.

23
00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.260
The resulting snapshot will allow
the user to see the contents

24
00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.640
without having the ability to modify
the underlying workbook elements.

25
00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:34.870
Navigate to the file menu and choose
options, and select customize ribbon.

26
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.177
In the menu to the right under the home
tab Create a custom group, and

27
00:01:41.177 --> 00:01:42.716
name it as you see fit.

28
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.000
We will call ours Custom Commands.

29
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.234
On the drop down menu to the left,
change the selection to All Commands.

30
00:02:00.712 --> 00:02:03.711
And navigate down until you see camera.

31
00:02:06.256 --> 00:02:08.464
Add it to the custom
group you just created.

32
00:02:12.676 --> 00:02:15.267
It should now appear on your home tab.

33
00:02:15.267 --> 00:02:18.130
This button functions like
the shutter of a camera.

34
00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.810
You draw the selection with your mouse,
click the camera button, and

35
00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.560
you've taken your snapshot.

36
00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.820
You then navigate to where you would
like to place the snapshot and

37
00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.120
click to drop the picture in place.

38
00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.980
Any time the underlying selection updates,
so will the picture.

39
00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.560
We're now going to bring in some
elements from the slicers and

40
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.200
power pivot worksheet.

41
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.418
Navigate to that worksheet.

42
00:02:42.304 --> 00:02:48.300
Select the charting area cells B34 to I62.

43
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.410
Once selected, hit the Camera button.

44
00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.970
You've now taken a snapshot of this area,

45
00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.710
and your next click in
a worksheet will drop the image.

46
00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.350
Navigate back to
the Dashboard Finalization sheet.

47
00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.300
Click to drop the image near cell B16.

48
00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.830
You've now created an image that
cannot be modified by the user but

49
00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.170
still displays the information.

50
00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.140
To test this, attempt to make a selection
using the slicer inside of the image.

51
00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.650
Notice how this simply doesn't work.

52
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:21.990
You've only selected the image.

53
00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.164
However, if we navigate back to
the source and click on of the Slicers.

54
00:03:29.536 --> 00:03:34.260
We can return to our snapshot and
see the resulting change.

55
00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.000
You may be thinking, how are my users
going to use this on the dashboard?

56
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.110
I would not rate this high on
the functionality principle.

57
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:42.660
We'll get to that shortly.

58
00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.930
However, let's focus on the balance and
proportion principle.

59
00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.670
We are going to crop the image to fit.

60
00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.940
You probably notice the extra space
on the right side of the snapshot.

61
00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.370
We're going to remove that
using the cropping tool.

62
00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:56.730
Select the image by clicking on it.

63
00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:03.240
Navigate to the Picture Tools Format
menu and select Crop.

64
00:04:06.272 --> 00:04:09.770
Then drag the right side of the snapshot
in, removing the extra space.

65
00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.200
When done, click the crop button again.

66
00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.820
Note that you can also size and
scale this image to fit your needs.

67
00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.580
The camera tool is also useful for
resizing workbook elements

68
00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:24.389
when bringing together
a consolidated view of information.

69
00:04:26.072 --> 00:04:28.900
Next we'll fix the slicer situation
to give our users a way to

70
00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:29.830
control the charts.

71
00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.100
Since the slicer in our
snapshot doesn't do anything,

72
00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.150
we need to bring in a slicer
that actually functions.

73
00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.500
Return to the slicers in
powerpivot worksheet and

74
00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.430
select the route ID slicer that is
sitting inside of the charting area.

75
00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:47.990
Hit Ctrl-C to copy this element.

76
00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.706
Return to the Dashboard Finalization
sheet and select a blank cell.

77
00:04:53.706 --> 00:04:57.360
Use Ctrl-V to paste.

78
00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.650
This produces an exact copy of the slicer
which now exists in two locations and

79
00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.620
functions exactly the same
in both locations.

80
00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.890
Drag this replicated
slicer over the snapshot,

81
00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:11.430
covering up the nonfunctional
slicer from the image.

82
00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.756
You should now be able to select a route,
and see the chart update.

83
00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:23.563
However, when you're on the dashboard
finalization sheet, you won't be able to

84
00:05:23.563 --> 00:05:26.869
actually select any of the three
charts being impacted by the slicer.

85
00:05:28.523 --> 00:05:32.655
Next we're going to grab another snapshot
to continue meeting the outlined

86
00:05:32.655 --> 00:05:34.083
requirements of the COO.

87
00:05:34.083 --> 00:05:37.783
The detailed flight delay
information resides in the CF and

88
00:05:37.783 --> 00:05:40.320
KPI- Airlines Secure sheet.

89
00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.550
This will largely be a repeat of
the camera process we just learned.

90
00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.743
Select cells B39 to E44.

91
00:05:52.092 --> 00:05:53.260
Toggle the camera button.

92
00:05:54.540 --> 00:06:00.201
Return to the dashboard finalization
sheet and drop the image near cell Q22.

93
00:06:02.957 --> 00:06:04.556
We now have an image on the page but

94
00:06:04.556 --> 00:06:06.850
we need to provide the user
with input control.

95
00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:12.964
In order to do this, we'll duplicate
our form controls in the next step.

96
00:06:12.964 --> 00:06:17.018
The CF and KPI- Airlines sheet
has the cell structure and

97
00:06:17.018 --> 00:06:19.564
form control spin buttons we need.

98
00:06:19.564 --> 00:06:26.390
Go to this worksheet and
select cells B35 to C37.

99
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:27.160
And copy them.

100
00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:34.162
Return to the finalization sheet,
and paste these cells in Q18.

101
00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:40.406
We now have cells that display our output,

102
00:06:40.406 --> 00:06:43.878
but still need to provide the user
with controls to adjust the selection.

103
00:06:47.231 --> 00:06:49.879
Return to the CF and KPI- Airlines sheet.

104
00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:53.965
Holding the Control key click
on both of the spin buttons.

105
00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:58.000
And hit Ctrl+C to copy.

106
00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:03.126
Return to the finalization sheet and
hit Ctrl+V.

107
00:07:04.804 --> 00:07:08.480
Duplicate spin buttons now exist on
this sheet but are dynamically linked.

108
00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:11.930
Move them so
they are aligned with the Flight Year and

109
00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:13.700
Flight Month cells we imported earlier.

110
00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:20.161
These spin buttons control the delay
flight charts across the workbook and

111
00:07:20.161 --> 00:07:21.072
in our snapshot.

112
00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:27.467
We also want to put a box around
the elements that are all tied to the form

113
00:07:27.467 --> 00:07:31.610
controls, which in this case is the
snapshot of the flight delay information.

114
00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:35.834
Navigate to the DEVELOPER tab and

115
00:07:35.834 --> 00:07:40.745
insert a group box that spans
from approximately Q18 to Y33.

116
00:07:50.642 --> 00:07:55.137
This will indicate to our user that
the contained elements operate together.

117
00:08:06.421 --> 00:08:09.888
Finally, we need to remove elements
of Excel's visual interface that

118
00:08:09.888 --> 00:08:13.540
are unnecessary for our dashboard to
ensure it looks great on the monitor.

119
00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:18.400
First let's hide some of the worksheets
that operate in the background and

120
00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:20.700
don't provide the user any value.

121
00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:27.692
Right click on the CF &
KPI Airlines Secure sheet and select Hide.

122
00:08:27.692 --> 00:08:31.060
The worksheet still exists but
is not displayed.

123
00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:33.280
You can always right-click
on any sheet and

124
00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:36.470
choose unhide to re-display the sheets.

125
00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:39.730
Repeat the process for
the form control output sheet.

126
00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:44.640
You can continue to hide
worksheets if you like,

127
00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:49.090
including the worksheets that provided
sources for our camera snapshots.

128
00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:51.451
Let's just select them all
once by holding control.

129
00:08:55.458 --> 00:08:58.000
Then we can right click and
hide them all at once.

130
00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:01.020
We'll also remove the formula bar.

131
00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:03.950
We don't want our user to be
able to manipulate any formulas,

132
00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:05.950
so there's no need for this.

133
00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:11.160
Navigate to file, options, advanced.

134
00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:16.970
And scroll down until you
arrive at the display section.

135
00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:20.773
Uncheck Show formula bar.

136
00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:26.470
Scroll down a bit farther to the display
options for this worksheet area.

137
00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:29.969
Uncheck the Show row and
column headers box,

138
00:09:29.969 --> 00:09:32.509
because they won't need to
see these items either.

139
00:09:36.224 --> 00:09:39.290
There are plenty of other options for
changing what is displayed and

140
00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:40.930
you can do this as you see fit.

141
00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:44.070
Even going as far as password
protection for the workbook.

142
00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:45.980
This all depends on your audience.

143
00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:50.340
In our case, the COO is unlikely to commit
any egregious errors with this data.

144
00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:53.300
So we don't need to go as far as
we would if the source file was

145
00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:55.430
stored on a shared drive or
frequently emailed.

146
00:09:57.130 --> 00:10:01.010
The dashboard you've just produced meets
the features requested by our COO and it's

147
00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:05.330
constructed in a way that's adequately
robust against user manipulation.

148
00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:07.922
The COO can easily display
this information and

149
00:10:07.922 --> 00:10:12.198
use a touch screen monitor and potentially
other devices to edit the inputs and

150
00:10:12.198 --> 00:10:14.159
display the desired information.

151
00:10:14.159 --> 00:10:15.510
Now it's your turn.

152
00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:20.126
Practice what you've learned by
going to your exercise workbook and

153
00:10:20.126 --> 00:10:25.472
completing exercise four, Finalizing
Dashboard and Securing the Workbook.

154
00:10:25.472 --> 00:10:35.472
