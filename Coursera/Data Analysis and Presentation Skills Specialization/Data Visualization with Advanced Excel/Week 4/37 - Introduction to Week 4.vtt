2
00:00:10.926 --> 00:00:13.221
Welcome back to the final
week of this course.

3
00:00:13.221 --> 00:00:16.794
During this week,
you'll be learning about dashboarding.

4
00:00:16.794 --> 00:00:18.820
So what do we mean when we
use the term dashboarding?

5
00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.670
Dashboarding allows a user to quickly
focus on the most important aspect of

6
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.630
a system using the principles of
visualization and data modeling.

7
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.180
In many ways, this is the culmination of
weeks one through three of this course.

8
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.600
Remember, in week one,
we learned how to develop a data model.

9
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.050
Which then can be used to
perform a simulation or

10
00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.400
scenario analysis like we
discussed in week two.

11
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.490
Then in week three we learned how to
create strong visualizations of the data

12
00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:47.980
in order to highlight the main trends and
key takeaways.

13
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.030
Now we're going to bring together
these elements in order to

14
00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.590
develop highly effective dashboards.

15
00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.290
Let's talk about how and
why we use dashboards.

16
00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.230
The first thing you need to think about
when creating a dashboard is the audience.

17
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.550
What are the expectations for
the dashboard?

18
00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.500
Your audience's expectations will drive
most decisions regarding the dashboard

19
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.690
from the initial design,
to the final end product.

20
00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.250
This is why we will start this week
by discussing how to establish a good

21
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.200
understanding of your audience, and
how to collect key requirements.

22
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.230
From there, we will move on to
some guiding design principles

23
00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.650
including choosing chart elements.

24
00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.800
Then we will discuss core
update considerations and

25
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.450
how this affects the build
of the dashboard.

26
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.620
Finally, you will have a chance to
practice everything you've learned

27
00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.710
by creating a functional
dashboard in Excel.

28
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.580
Dashboards have proved to be
a powerful tool for many of my clients.

29
00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.840
Well thought out dashboards can quickly
show the client a quick snapshot

30
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:43.780
of their data.

31
00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.580
And can be built to allow them to drill
down into more details if needed.

32
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.140
For example, we helped one of my recent
clients understand their medical and

33
00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.860
pharmacy claims data,
by displaying key analytics and

34
00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.450
combining them in one simple and
easy to use dashboard.

35
00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.140
Summarizing the key metrics in one spot
allow the client to get a quick overview

36
00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.410
of the claims data.

37
00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.960
And better understand certain risks and
opportunities.

38
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.720
Just like weeks one through three,
you'll go through a series of videos and

39
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.780
demonstrations.

40
00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.220
Have a chance to practice
in an Excel workbook, and

41
00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.060
to demonstrate what you've learned.

42
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.760
Thanks for joining me and
have a great week.
