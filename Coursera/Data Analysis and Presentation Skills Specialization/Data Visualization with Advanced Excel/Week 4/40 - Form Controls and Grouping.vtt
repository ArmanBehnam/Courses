[MUSIC]

2
00:00:05.847 --> 00:00:09.219
In this exercise, we're going to
learn how to use Form Controls and

3
00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:13.000
Group Boxes to create interactive
dashboard components in Excel.

4
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.942
Specifically, we're going to learn to use
form controls to help us alternate between

5
00:00:16.942 --> 00:00:20.236
different pivot table measures,
which will in turn update the table and

6
00:00:20.236 --> 00:00:21.596
the associated pivot chart.

7
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:26.898
By the end of this exercise,

8
00:00:26.898 --> 00:00:30.769
you should have a good understanding of
how form controls, such as option buttons,

9
00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:34.390
can be integrated with pivot charts in
order to create interactive graphics.

10
00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.660
Let's start by taking a look at our data.

11
00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.120
As you can see, a pivot table has been
provided as part of this exercise.

12
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.270
The pivot table summarizes
the ticket price, total fare and

13
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.872
departure delay information
on a monthly basis.

14
00:00:49.988 --> 00:00:54.109
Directly above the pivot table, we find an
empty table that we're going to populate

15
00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:58.016
using the pivot table, Excel formulas and
most importantly, form controls.

16
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.710
First, we're going to add
a group box to the worksheet.

17
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.880
A group box is a type of form control that
can be used to group related controls,

18
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.960
such as buttons or check boxes,
into one visual unit.

19
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.510
A group box also keeps important
reference information consistent.

20
00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.280
In this exercise, we are going to
be using multiple option buttons,

21
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.720
which return an index value depending
on the option that is selected.

22
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.230
The index increases with each new button.

23
00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:31.510
Group box helps us keep the index values
of the option buttons from overlapping.

24
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.350
Having a form control such as a group
box is done using the Developer tab.

25
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.430
This tab is not activated
by default in Excel, so

26
00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.430
we're going to start by
activating this option.

27
00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.410
Let's navigate to the File tab and
then we select Options.

28
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.920
This brings up a pop-up window with
a number of different Excel settings and

29
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.030
options.

30
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.160
We want to add a tab to our Excel ribbon,
so let's click on Customize Ribbon.

31
00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.230
On the right side of this window,
we can now see a list called Main Tabs,

32
00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.490
which can be used to
customize your Excel ribbon.

33
00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.200
We want to add the Developer
tab to our workbook.

34
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.590
So let's go ahead and
check the box in front of Developer and

35
00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.840
then we click OK to confirm our changes.

36
00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.541
Note that we now have an additional tab
on our ribbon, let's go check it out.

37
00:02:21.541 --> 00:02:26.261
The DEVELOPER tab provides a variety
of features including coding for

38
00:02:26.261 --> 00:02:28.749
VBA Macros and importing XML files.

39
00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.850
Now that we're in the Developer tab,

40
00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.430
we're going to select the Insert button
that can be found in the Control section.

41
00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.530
When we click on this button, notice how
we're given several different options,

42
00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.880
including a combo box,
check box or even a scroll bar.

43
00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.420
We want to insert a group box, so
let's select that option from the menu.

44
00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.650
Notice how the cursor has changed shape
once we move it back into the spreadsheet.

45
00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.150
This is how Excel is letting us know that
we can create the group box by clicking

46
00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.440
anywhere in the sheet and dragging until
we get the size we are looking for.

47
00:03:02.586 --> 00:03:05.066
So let's start by clicking on cells and

48
00:03:05.066 --> 00:03:08.608
then dragging the cursor all
the way down to cell C38.

49
00:03:08.608 --> 00:03:12.699
The box doesn't need to be any exact size,
we just want to make sure we have enough

50
00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:15.660
room for the option buttons
that we'll be creating next.

51
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.710
Notice how the group boxes are being
generically named by Excel.

52
00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:24.770
Let's go ahead and change the caption
to something a little more meaningful.

53
00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.080
Since we are going to use the form
controls to alternate between the measures

54
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.730
in our pivot table, we'll change
the name to select measure to display.

55
00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.598
We can edit the text on the title by
putting the cursor over the current title,

56
00:03:39.598 --> 00:03:43.083
right-clicking and
selecting Edit Text from the menu.

57
00:03:53.418 --> 00:03:56.690
Now that we have our group box,
we're ready to add the option buttons.

58
00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:58.630
Since we have three
measures to choose from,

59
00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.350
we will need to insert
three option buttons.

60
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.955
Option buttons are also form controls, so

61
00:04:03.955 --> 00:04:06.680
we're going to use the Developer
tab again to insert them.

62
00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.620
We click on the Insert button in
the control section of the tab,

63
00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.260
which gives us a drop down
menu with the various options.

64
00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.350
We select option button in the menu and
using our cursor, we click and

65
00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.320
drag inside of the group box
to create the option button.

66
00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.732
See how there's now a little
button within our group box?

67
00:04:26.732 --> 00:04:30.740
It's still a generic button, since we
have not yet linked it to anything.

68
00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.010
But before we link the button,
let's create the two additional buttons

69
00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.600
by going back to the insert option and
once more selecting the option button.

70
00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.770
We click in the group box below our first
button and drag to create a second button.

71
00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:49.300
Similarly, for the last button, we click
on Insert and select option button.

72
00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:50.010
And then click and

73
00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.000
drag below to the second button
to create the last option button.

74
00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.990
Of course, we want to make sure we keep
in mind the key principles of design, so

75
00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.810
let's take a second to align
the buttons we just created.

76
00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.000
We are going to select the three
buttons by holding the CTRL key and

77
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.400
clicking on each of the buttons.

78
00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.130
Notice that a DRAWING TOOLS
tab now appears in the ribbon.

79
00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.672
Let's navigate to the arrange
section of the tab and select Align.

80
00:05:15.672 --> 00:05:19.340
First, we're going to use
the Align Left feature,

81
00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:20.970
which aligns the boxes to the left.

82
00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:26.510
And then we're going to use
the Distribute Vertically feature

83
00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:29.820
to balance the buttons
within the group box.

84
00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.660
Now remember the key principles of design.

85
00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:37.530
We want to make the option buttons purpose
and functionality clear by renaming them.

86
00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:40.680
The buttons are going to be used
to manipulate the pivot table.

87
00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.565
We're going to use
the headers of the table and

88
00:05:42.565 --> 00:05:46.440
making sure we maintain the order of
the buttons to remain consistent.

89
00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.820
This will help us when we get to
the next part of the exercise.

90
00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:55.200
Starting with the first option button,
we're going to press the CTRL key and

91
00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.460
click on the button in order to select it.

92
00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.160
This is something that is
particular about option buttons.

93
00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:04.000
You can't select the object itself by
simply clicking on it since that's how you

94
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:04.870
select the option.

95
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.060
Now that we have managed
to select the first button,

96
00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.310
we're going to double-click on
the text to enable editing.

97
00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:14.720
Let's highlight the current text and
replace it with Ticket Price.

98
00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.079
Since this is the header of
the first column in the pivot table.

99
00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:21.650
Next, we select the second button
by holding down the CTRL key and

100
00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:22.480
clicking on the button.

101
00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:27.750
We double-click on the text to start
editing, highlight the text and then type

102
00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:31.210
out Total Fare, since this is the header
for the second column in the pivot table.

103
00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:37.340
Last but not least, we select the third
button and double-click to start editing.

104
00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:40.750
We highlight the text and replace it
with the header of the last element in

105
00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:43.230
the pivot table, which is Depart Delay.

106
00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:51.814
The value of the option button that is
selected will be stored in cell C42.

107
00:06:51.814 --> 00:06:55.720
So now we need to link the buttons
that we just created with the cell.

108
00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.410
We do this by right-clicking
on the first option button and

109
00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:01.210
selecting Format Control
from the drop down menu.

110
00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:06.230
As you can see this gives us a pop up
window with various options to format and

111
00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:07.090
edit the option button.

112
00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.560
We want to link it to cell C42 which

113
00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:15.320
can be done by navigating to the Control
tab at the very right side of the window.

114
00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:17.853
We click in the cell link box and

115
00:07:17.853 --> 00:07:23.127
then go to the worksheet where
we are going to select cell C42.

116
00:07:23.127 --> 00:07:25.520
And then click OK to validate our choice.

117
00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:32.659
Note that if we select the second button,
the number in cell C42 becomes a 2.

118
00:07:32.659 --> 00:07:34.660
This is the magic of a group box.

119
00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:37.870
Since all three option buttons
are part of the same group box,

120
00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:40.200
we only need to link one
of them to cell C42 and

121
00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:44.010
the two remaining buttons are linked
to the same cell automatically.

122
00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:48.240
We can see that by toggling
between the three option buttons,

123
00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:52.670
the number in cell C42
changes from 1 to 2 to 3.

124
00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:56.852
If we were to add a fourth button in
the group box, that would also be linked

125
00:07:56.852 --> 00:08:00.436
to cell C42 automatically and
it would have the number four.

126
00:08:00.436 --> 00:08:03.868
Note that if we create another group
box with the option buttons in it,

127
00:08:03.868 --> 00:08:07.707
the numbering would start again at one
since Excel considers it to be a separate

128
00:08:07.707 --> 00:08:08.310
instance.

129
00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:13.450
We've successfully linked
the option buttons to cell C42,

130
00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:17.250
this cell now shows us which option
has been select by the user.

131
00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:21.099
Next we're going to look at how we can use
this to change the data we're showing in

132
00:08:21.099 --> 00:08:21.902
our dashboard.

133
00:08:24.138 --> 00:08:27.355
We want to complete the empty data
table that is located right above

134
00:08:27.355 --> 00:08:28.225
the pivot table.

135
00:08:28.225 --> 00:08:32.325
And we're going to start by filling
in the header in cell C45 by

136
00:08:32.325 --> 00:08:33.745
using the INDEX formula.

137
00:08:34.905 --> 00:08:38.400
Remember what we learned about
the INDEX formula in course two.

138
00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:42.130
This formula is used to get a value
from a table by providing the column and

139
00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:44.910
row numbers of the cell we're looking for.

140
00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:48.280
For a refresher on how this formula
is used, please return to course two.

141
00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:55.927
Let's start by selecting cell C45 and
typing =, followed by INDEX.

142
00:08:59.412 --> 00:09:02.590
Our array is going to be
the header of the pivot table.

143
00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:04.511
So let's go ahead and select those cells.

144
00:09:08.296 --> 00:09:12.799
Since we selected a row, all we have to
do now is provide the column number from

145
00:09:12.799 --> 00:09:14.480
the cell that we want to get.

146
00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:20.060
This is where we are going to use cell
C42, since it represents the number of

147
00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:24.490
the column that the user has
selected using the option buttons.

148
00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:27.670
Now we can close out our formula
using another parenthesis and

149
00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:29.160
then we press Enter.

150
00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.830
See how the cell currently
says DepartDelay,

151
00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:33.710
since the third option button is selected?

152
00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:38.410
Note that it will change if we select
the first option button again.

153
00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:39.520
Now it says TicketPrice.

154
00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:43.610
We're going to fill up the rest
of the table using the index and

155
00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:46.480
match functions that we discussed
previously in this course.

156
00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:47.118
Let's get started.

157
00:09:47.118 --> 00:09:50.610
Begin typing =INDEX.

158
00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:55.149
The array will be the range of
data in the pivot table we want to

159
00:09:55.149 --> 00:09:59.781
return information from,
which is cell C62 to cell E73.

160
00:09:59.781 --> 00:10:05.160
Select this range and
use the F4 key to anchor the selection.

161
00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.780
The next argument is the row number.

162
00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:10.520
We will determine this by
matching the month and

163
00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:13.890
the column to the left of our index
formula with the pivot table.

164
00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:19.480
Type MATCH and open parenthesis.

165
00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:24.660
The first argument in this subformula
is the cell holding the value

166
00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:26.730
that we want to look for.

167
00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:29.209
This is in cell B46.

168
00:10:29.209 --> 00:10:32.040
The next argument is
the array we want to look in.

169
00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:40.900
This will be the list of months in
our pivot table, cells B62 to B73.

170
00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:45.841
Anchor the selection using F4.

171
00:10:45.841 --> 00:10:49.460
The final argument is the type of match.

172
00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:53.200
In this case,
we want an exact match, so use zero.

173
00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:58.540
After closing this argument,
we need to provide the final argument

174
00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:04.280
of our index formula which identifies the
column we want to use in our pivot table.

175
00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:09.170
We can point to the form control
selection cell C42 above.

176
00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:11.826
Lock the cell using F4.

177
00:11:17.485 --> 00:11:20.900
You can now copy this formula down
to complete the remaining months.

178
00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:30.465
And it will dynamically change based
on the radio button selection above.

179
00:11:30.465 --> 00:11:34.199
We have successfully created a dynamic
table where the values change based on

180
00:11:34.199 --> 00:11:35.530
the option that we select.

181
00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:39.450
Now we're going to use this table to
create a dynamic chart that will give us

182
00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:43.400
a visual image of the data allowing
us to spot trends more easily.

183
00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:46.820
We're going to start by selecting
the data that we want to use.

184
00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:50.158
Here that is cell B45 through cell C57.

185
00:11:50.158 --> 00:11:54.679
Once we've selected the data, we navigate
to the insert tab on the ribbon and select

186
00:11:54.679 --> 00:11:58.960
the Recommended Charts option that is
located in the charts section of the tab.

187
00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:03.670
Since our data is a time series,
we will be using a line graph.

188
00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:04.848
So let's pick that option.

189
00:12:08.145 --> 00:12:10.175
Now we have a graph
that shows the data and

190
00:12:10.175 --> 00:12:13.820
can be dynamically changed by
selecting a different option.

191
00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:15.150
For example, Depart Delays.

192
00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:20.320
We have created all the key
elements of a basic dashboard.

193
00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:23.700
However, we should always remember to
keep in mind the principles of design.

194
00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:27.390
For example, here we should make sure
we format the graph we just created

195
00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:29.570
before finalizing the dashboard.

196
00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:32.480
It is possible to selectively add or
remove chart elements by

197
00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:36.530
clicking on the chart and finding the plus
button in the upper-right corner.

198
00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:39.460
We're going to use this functionality
to remove the grid lines since

199
00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:41.780
this will make the chart easier to read.

200
00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:44.320
First, let's select
the graph by clicking on it.

201
00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:48.260
Next, if we look in the upper-right
corner, we can see a plus button up here.

202
00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.070
Let's go ahead and click that button.

203
00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:52.810
This takes us to a menu for
chart elements where we can

204
00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:55.680
use the check boxes to select
items that we want to display.

205
00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:58.370
We're going to remove the grid lines.

206
00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:01.020
So let's uncheck the box in that menu.

207
00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:04.230
As you can see,
the graph no longer has any grid lines.

208
00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:06.830
Next, we're going to remove
the borders of the graph.

209
00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:10.800
In order to do this, select the graph and
press the CTRL key followed by the 1 key.

210
00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:15.830
This will bring up a pop up menu
that allows us to format the graph.

211
00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:18.680
We want to remove the border.

212
00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:20.710
So let's go to the tab called borderline.

213
00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:24.463
And check the No line option.

214
00:13:24.463 --> 00:13:29.070
If we close the pop up window, you can
see that the graph no longer has borders.

215
00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:33.570
We want the primary emphasis to be
on the data elements of this chart.

216
00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:37.420
Which can be accomplished by making
the font color of the axis and

217
00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:38.600
title a lighter shade.

218
00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:42.250
We do this by selecting the x axis,

219
00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:47.380
navigating to the home tab on the ribbon
and clicking on the Font Color option.

220
00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:51.600
We want to make the font lighter, yet not
so light as to become difficult to read.

221
00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:53.790
Let's select a shade of gray.

222
00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:57.450
Now that we have picked
out a new font color,

223
00:13:57.450 --> 00:14:00.355
we need to make the same change
to the y axis and the title.

224
00:14:06.414 --> 00:14:09.747
We want to make sure to
select the same color of

225
00:14:09.747 --> 00:14:14.170
grey under the Font Color option
that we chose on the x axis.

226
00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:15.490
We have formatted our chart and

227
00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:17.890
have successfully kept the key
design principles in mind.

228
00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:21.650
As you can see, we just created
an interactive dashboard that

229
00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:25.840
displays various types of data based
on the options the end user selects.

230
00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:28.070
Now it's your turn.

231
00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:31.208
Practice what you've learned by
going to your exercise workbook and

232
00:14:31.208 --> 00:14:33.817
completing exercise one,
form controls and grouping.

233
00:14:35.983 --> 00:14:41.394
