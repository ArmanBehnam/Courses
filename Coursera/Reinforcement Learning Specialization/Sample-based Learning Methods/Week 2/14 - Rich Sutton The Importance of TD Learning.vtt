00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.685
My name is Richard Sutton.

2
00:00:08.685 --> 00:00:13.710
I'm a scientist, studied
reinforcement all my life.

3
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.090
I'm at the University of Alberta

4
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.415
I'm at DeepMind operator.

5
00:00:17.415 --> 00:00:23.400
And my spell my name is
S-U-T-T-O-N Richard is certain.

6
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.430
Okay. Today, I'm here

7
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.810
to tell you about the importance

8
00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.145
of temporal difference learning.

9
00:00:29.145 --> 00:00:30.510
Temporal difference learning is

10
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.070
a learning method that's

11
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.140
specialized for
prediction Learning.

12
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.655
And this makes it like

13
00:00:35.655 --> 00:00:37.500
the most important
thing really for

14
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.820
artificial intelligence
in this century.

15
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.530
So we know we focused
on methods that

16
00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.235
scale with computation
in recent years.

17
00:00:50.235 --> 00:00:52.200
In the old days we had

18
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.090
very similar methods but

19
00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.990
now computation is
so much greater.

20
00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:01.985
Because of that, these methods
are much more impactful.

21
00:01:01.985 --> 00:01:06.230
So the kind of learning
that skills the best most

22
00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.510
thoroughly to a larger extent

23
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.105
with computation is
prediction learning.

24
00:01:11.105 --> 00:01:11.855
You think about it.

25
00:01:11.855 --> 00:01:13.685
Prediction learning means you've

26
00:01:13.685 --> 00:01:15.100
tried to predict what
will happen next,

27
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.700
you make a prediction,
you wait and you see what

28
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:17.990
happens and then when

29
00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.330
you find out what
happens, you learn.

30
00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:20.590
And because of this,

31
00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:21.720
because you just have to wait,

32
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.360
you don't need training sets.

33
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.590
You don't need people to do a lot

34
00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:25.910
of work and prepare things.

35
00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.250
You don't even need an objective.

36
00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.230
Learning to predict is the single

37
00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:31.895
most scalable kind of learning.

38
00:01:31.895 --> 00:01:34.550
And temporal
difference learning is

39
00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.335
a kind of learning
that specialize

40
00:01:36.335 --> 00:01:37.805
for learning to predict.

41
00:01:37.805 --> 00:01:39.815
So what might that mean?

42
00:01:39.815 --> 00:01:41.515
What's special about
learning to predict?

43
00:01:41.515 --> 00:01:44.430
Well, one is time passes by
and you make a prediction.

44
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.660
You actually make a series
of predictions every moment.

45
00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.050
You make prediction
after prediction

46
00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:49.280
after prediction and then,

47
00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.320
you actually find out about what

48
00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.780
the correct answers were
for all those predictions.

49
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.565
When you find out what
actually happens.

50
00:01:55.565 --> 00:01:57.740
And so to deal with the temporal,

51
00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.335
the consequences of
that temporal structure,

52
00:02:00.335 --> 00:02:01.550
you need to have specialized

53
00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:02.660
learning rules and that's

54
00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.615
why we have temporal
difference learning.

55
00:02:04.615 --> 00:02:07.040
Now I'm sure you've already also

56
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.205
learned or heard about methods
for supervised learning.

57
00:02:10.205 --> 00:02:12.050
Supervised learning means
there is some kind of

58
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.630
supervisor that tells
you what the answer is.

59
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.360
Maybe that happens in
school, but in normal life,

60
00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.110
we don't have supervisors

61
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.940
or instructors telling
us what to do.

62
00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.740
But in prediction learning,
we do in prediction.

63
00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:25.460
In prediction learning, you make

64
00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:26.330
a prediction and then you

65
00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.250
just wait and you find
out what happens.

66
00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.155
This is so special.

67
00:02:30.155 --> 00:02:33.540
So you might say

68
00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.530
prediction learning is
supervised because you wait,

69
00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.860
you find out what happens
and then that instructs you.

70
00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.675
And you might say
it's also that it's

71
00:02:41.675 --> 00:02:43.280
unsupervised because you didn't

72
00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.420
have to have a supervisor,

73
00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.520
you just waited and
you found out to

74
00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.640
the natural course of events
what you should've said.

75
00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.220
So I like to think sometimes
that prediction learning

76
00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.220
is the unsupervised
supervised learning.

77
00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.975
Temporal difference
learning, remember is

78
00:02:59.975 --> 00:03:02.365
a method that's specialized

79
00:03:02.365 --> 00:03:03.410
for prediction learning for

80
00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:04.970
multi-step prediction learning.

81
00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.060
Now let me say one other thing
about supervised learning.

82
00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.520
You may often have heard
supervised learning

83
00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.330
described as prediction learning
and it is in a sense.

84
00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.550
The most important
sense it's not.

85
00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:17.840
It's when you make

86
00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.850
a prediction and then you're
told what the answer is.

87
00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:23.840
It's not where you
actually have to

88
00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.325
wait and see what happens.

89
00:03:25.325 --> 00:03:28.550
Supervised learning is
often training sets or,

90
00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.650
you could use
prediction learning in

91
00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:31.700
the special case
where you're only

92
00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:32.900
trying to predict one step,

93
00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.080
then you can make
a prediction, wait one step,

94
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.160
see the result and you can

95
00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.115
treat it as a traditional
supervised learning problem.

96
00:03:40.115 --> 00:03:43.310
But most of our predictions
are not one-step predictions.

97
00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.270
We just see what happens
like later in the day,

98
00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:48.685
or a second from now,

99
00:03:48.685 --> 00:03:50.130
one step. What does one step?

100
00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.890
One step might be
considered a tenth of a

101
00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.990
second and assure we make

102
00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:56.240
predictions at a tenth of
a second but much more

103
00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.225
important in our lives, our
longer-term predictions.

104
00:03:59.225 --> 00:03:59.860
Well,

105
00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.845
if prediction learning and
temporal difference learning

106
00:04:01.845 --> 00:04:03.570
so it's an important
kind of learning,

107
00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.360
you might expect that it might

108
00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.525
arise in natural systems
in animals and people.

109
00:04:08.525 --> 00:04:11.119
And it's almost incidental

110
00:04:11.119 --> 00:04:14.565
to our development within
the artificial intelligence,

111
00:04:14.565 --> 00:04:16.720
but it is true that

112
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.550
temporal difference learning
has played a major role in

113
00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:21.950
the theory of how animals

114
00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:25.025
learn and particularly
in the reward systems.

115
00:04:25.025 --> 00:04:26.990
Temporal difference model is now

116
00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.720
the standard model of
reward systems in the brain.

117
00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.280
We can see signals in the brain

118
00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.975
that correspond
with the TD error.

119
00:04:32.975 --> 00:04:36.425
And these appear
to drive learning

120
00:04:36.425 --> 00:04:38.330
just as would be predicted

121
00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.820
by temporal difference
learning models.

122
00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.940
So you may have heard
about dopamine,

123
00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.580
the stand in animals
and in mammals.

124
00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:47.840
The thing that carries

125
00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.130
the temporal difference error

126
00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.490
is the dopamine neurotransmitter.

127
00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.430
In other animals, it's
a different transmitter like in

128
00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:57.980
bees the signal that carries

129
00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.190
the temporal difference area
is called octopamine.

130
00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.770
But it's the same really even in

131
00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.025
these very different
systems of animals,

132
00:05:07.025 --> 00:05:16.460
insects and mammals and
primates and even in sea slugs.

133
00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.790
So I guess I wanted to say
a little bit more about,

134
00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:21.380
I'm a little bit hesitant about

135
00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.830
talking about
the relationships between

136
00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.600
Engineering or AI
models of learning

137
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:32.090
and psychological models of
natural learning systems.

138
00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:35.030
This can be overdone but I

139
00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:36.530
still am proud of the fact

140
00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:38.675
that temporal
difference learning is

141
00:05:38.675 --> 00:05:40.850
a serious important topic both in

142
00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:43.475
AI and in psychology
and neuroscience

143
00:05:43.475 --> 00:05:45.500
because it is appreciated

144
00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.480
in each one of
these separate fields for

145
00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.660
the very separate and
different criteria

146
00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:52.700
that those fields
have for success.

147
00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:55.580
In AI, we celebrate temporal
difference learning because

148
00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:56.900
it's a powerful kind of

149
00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:58.535
learning that's very
widely applicable.

150
00:05:58.535 --> 00:05:59.750
And in neuroscience, they

151
00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:01.370
celebrate temporal
difference learning

152
00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:05.665
because it accurately models
predicts animal behavior.

153
00:06:05.665 --> 00:06:08.675
And so all these things are
really prediction Learning.

154
00:06:08.675 --> 00:06:12.020
Prediction learning
is the key to AI,

155
00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.160
prediction learning is the most

156
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.960
important single kind
of learning.

157
00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.450
And temporal
difference learning is

158
00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:19.340
a specialized methods
that take advantage of

159
00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:22.410
the temporal structure
of learning to predict.

160
00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:27.910
Thank you very much.
There's some material.
