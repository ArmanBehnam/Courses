00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.500
Hi, I'm Martha.

2
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.800
I'm an assistant professor at
the University of Alberta.

3
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.200
Hi, I'm Adam.

4
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.000
I'm a research professor at
the University of Alberta and

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.600
a senior researcher at deepmind.

6
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.000
Adam is well known for his work on
predictive knowledge for reinforcement

7
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.300
learning some other research groups around
the world are building on these ideas.

8
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.100
I personally think it is some of the most
important work in recent years and

9
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.600
will only become more influential.

10
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.801
He's also an impressive empiricist a real
master designing experiments to cut to

11
00:00:36.801 --> 00:00:38.300
the key issues.

12
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.400
He's constantly trying to improve
scientific understanding in the RL

13
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.000
community.

14
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.500
Martha's algorithm
contributions to reinforce and

15
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.600
learning are too many to list here.

16
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.800
She has developed several new off policy
learning algorithms new approaches to

17
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.400
policy gradient and dozens of impressive
contributions to representation learning.

18
00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.100
She is truly one of the young rising
stars and reinforce learning.

19
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.000
She also happens to be my most frequent
co-author and my partner in life.

20
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.600
So how did you get into computer science?

21
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.900
I grew up in the east coast and
high school.

22
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.600
I was really interested in the Sciences
physics chemistry biology, but

23
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.300
I couldn't really find the right fit.

24
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.200
So I kind of randomly took a course on
computer science and programming actually

25
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.900
in gw-basic and it was really
just a career-defining moment for

26
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.000
me because I just remember the first time,
you know, implementing an if statement or

27
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.800
for Loop and it was just amazing
to me that I could get a computer

28
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.800
to execute a sequence of instructions for
me.

29
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.700
And so from there like there was
no hope I was always going to do

30
00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.000
computer science in college.

31
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.200
Okay, and then from there,

32
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.700
you know, why did you start
working on reinforcement learning?

33
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.600
So for Graduate Studies I moved out
to Alberta and I came out here to do

34
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.100
parallel distributed computing that that's
what I kind of focused on in my undergrad.

35
00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.200
So I would had all my courses loaded
up with you know systems courses and

36
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.200
I have one more elective to fill so I was
looking around for course to take and

37
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.700
I did a very reasonable strategy.

38
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.400
I looked at the perfect pictures of
the professors and I picked a friendliest

39
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.100
looking Professor I could find and
yeah that turned out to be rich Sutton and

40
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.100
it was introduction to reinforce
learning and that course was amazing.

41
00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.900
It was really inspiring.

42
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.400
It was my first introduction
to artificial intelligence or

43
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.700
machine learning of any kind.

44
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.900
And so I remember one of the early
assignments in that course,

45
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.600
we were implementing
sarsa to do a grid world.

46
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.100
And again, it was another
career defining moment for me.

47
00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.500
Just watching this agent
learn to solve this Maze and

48
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.800
all they got was this reward
signal - one per step and

49
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.600
somehow it figured out this amazingly
efficient path out of the Maze.

50
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.400
And again, it just amazed me and I was
hooked and I was going Doing that for

51
00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.200
the rest of my life.

52
00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.200
So Martha, how did you end up doing
research in machine learning and

53
00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.700
artificial intelligence?

54
00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.700
Well, I actually started
my undergrad in math.

55
00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.300
I've always thought functions and
dynamical systems are beautiful.

56
00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.400
And then I just took a CS course for
fun and it really was very fun.

57
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.700
So I just continued in both math and
Cs and

58
00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.200
those two topics go really well together
for AI and machine learning actually.

59
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.400
So and then I did some research
in AI in the summertime and

60
00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.500
just continued from there and
I really just stayed in the field

61
00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.000
because over time I realized it was
more than just about functions in math.

62
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.600
It's really a community where
you get to collaborate a lot and

63
00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.700
you get to make a career where you help
people so my day I get to Mentor a lot and

64
00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.800
I get to work at a big team working on
hard problems and it's really just very

65
00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.800
amazing to get to work on such
interesting questions in a team.

66
00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.300
There's probably some people who are
taking this RL course because they want to

67
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.800
do Graduate Studies in RL.

68
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.400
So what's one of the most important things
you learned in your Graduate Studies?

69
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.900
Well, maybe surprisingly enough.

70
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.700
I learned a lesson that's useful
across probably all the sciences.

71
00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.700
And in fact just any form of research and
that's to really love coming to understand

72
00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.700
the details of things to focus and
do small problems and

73
00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.200
understand the really really well and that
that's something that I think is really

74
00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.400
applicable across a wide range of things
and it's something that I pass on in my

75
00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.900
students in my classes and I really focus
on teaching my graduate students that and

76
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.200
it's something that I hope to share to
the people taking the specialization.

77
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.200
So what do you like about your job?

78
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.500
Well, I love doing research.

79
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.100
But sometimes that can kind of
grind you down a little bit.

80
00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.200
Like it's really long hours.

81
00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.300
The peer review process can be
a little frustrating and so

82
00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.900
in those times when you kind of step
back and look at your research,

83
00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.200
it can seem kind of small and a little bit
insignificant and it's hard to see where

84
00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.400
that's going how that's going to impact
the world and make it a better place.

85
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.800
And so in those times you can always
fall back and think about teaching and

86
00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.600
mentorship right teaching is where you
get to help people learn about things for

87
00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:49.100
the first time to come to understand how
your field works and it's just so exciting

88
00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.800
and you're also being part of the,
you know, the beginning of their career is

89
00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.300
whether they end up in Academia or
industry or starting their own companies.

90
00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.700
It's just such an amazing experience
that be part of that process and

91
00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.000
you know throat my week.

92
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.600
My the best day for me is always the days
when my schedules full of meetings with

93
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.300
my students and I get to help
them work on their problems and

94
00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.100
kind understand reinforcement
learning better.

95
00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:16.100
So why do you think it's so important
to work on reinforcement learning

96
00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:19.000
wasn't the promise of RL is really big but
there are still

97
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.200
a lot of open challenges machine learning
has started being used much more widely.

98
00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.000
But our else kind of only
been used in a few areas.

99
00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.200
But at the same time I think Carl
can have a really big impact and

100
00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.000
I think within the next decade or so,

101
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.600
we're going to see more control Engineers
actually using RL in their systems.

102
00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.600
We're really just going to see that
it's a tool that can help in automated

103
00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.900
decision making really within a larger
engineered systems, but I think for

104
00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.800
that to really happen we need
to make some advances in RL.

105
00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.600
We need to start thinking more about how
we're going to have robust algorithms and

106
00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.800
how we're going to get people to be
comfortable using these algorithms.

107
00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.700
So I think alongside adoption in Industry.

108
00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:02.100
We're going to need to be thinking about
how we can improve our algorithms so

109
00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:03.800
that these two things can happen together.

110
00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:06.300
So, how about you?

111
00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.000
Why do you think RL is good to work on?

112
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.200
Well, naturally, I think reinforce
learning is just the exact right framework

113
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:18.500
to study Ai and to make progress towards
solving AI but RL is also really important

114
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.000
to me because I'm very interested
in developmental Learning System.

115
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.700
So you can think about you know humans,
you know babies playing on the floor or

116
00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:28.900
young animals learning about the world.

117
00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:33.200
I want to learn about those systems and
how they work and if you think about those

118
00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:37.700
systems, they learn an enormous amount
in such a tiny amount of time, right?

119
00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:39.200
They learn how to crawl.

120
00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.300
They learn how their bodies work.

121
00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.900
They learn how to interact with their
environment manipulate objects communicate

122
00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:49.300
with other agents in the world and there's
just generally they're very competent

123
00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:53.200
learning systems and they do that over
like a couple weeks to a couple months and

124
00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.900
it's just really astounding and
it feels like we have so

125
00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:59.400
much work to do to get close
to those kind of systems.

126
00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.000
And so I really want to come to
understand the algorithms and

127
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.500
the representations that
those systems might be using.

128
00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:07.400
And I think reinforce alarming is
the right lens to look at those things and

129
00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:08.800
to come to understand those things.

130
00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:14.400
So applications always kind of Drive
interest and excitement in the field and

131
00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:17.800
we've had a few of them in games and
some industrial control problems.

132
00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:21.100
But what do you think is going to be the
next big thing in reinforcement learning?

133
00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:25.300
Well as hard I think RL is just general
approached automated decision making

134
00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:30.500
it's a tool that's going to help us
in a lot of our engineered systems.

135
00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:33.401
And so I think the place we're
really going to see it take off as

136
00:07:33.401 --> 00:07:36.300
an industrial control and
Industrial control.

137
00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:38.000
We have experts that
are really looking for

138
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.700
ways to improve the optimal
the how well their systems work.

139
00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:46.300
And so we're going to see you do
things like reduce energy costs or

140
00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:51.000
save on other types of costs that we have
in these industrial control systems and

141
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.100
in the hands of experts we can really make
these algorithms work well in the near

142
00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:55.001
future, so

143
00:07:55.001 --> 00:07:59.200
I really see it as a tool that's
going to facilitate experts in their

144
00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:02.500
work rather than say doing something like
replacing people are automating them away.
