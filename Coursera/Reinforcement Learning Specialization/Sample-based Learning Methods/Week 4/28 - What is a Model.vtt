1
00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.530
Sometimes, we make decisions

2
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:09.630
without thinking too
much about them,

3
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.805
such as deciding how
to drive to work.

4
00:00:11.805 --> 00:00:14.010
Other times, we sit and imagine

5
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.140
many possible scenarios based

6
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.060
on our understanding
of the world.

7
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.250
We can use these
imagined outcomes to

8
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.995
decide what to do
or what not to do.

9
00:00:22.995 --> 00:00:27.780
For example, if we carry
a fragile object with one hand,

10
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.030
we can imagine scenarios
where it falls and

11
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.435
breaks and we can make
choices accordingly.

12
00:00:33.435 --> 00:00:35.550
We've seen sample-based
methods like

13
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.855
TD which learn only from
sampled experience.

14
00:00:38.855 --> 00:00:42.080
We've also seen methods
like dynamic programming or

15
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.240
DP which plan by using

16
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.120
complete information
about how things work,

17
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.685
without having to make decisions.

18
00:00:49.685 --> 00:00:52.745
It would be even better
if we could obtain

19
00:00:52.745 --> 00:00:54.620
an intermediate method that can

20
00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.140
leverage the best
of both extremes.

21
00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.810
This week, we will
do just that and

22
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.050
unify these strategies with
the Dyner architecture.

23
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.170
In this video, we will
talk about models.

24
00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:07.940
By the end of the video,

25
00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.380
you will be able to describe

26
00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.695
a model and how it can be used,

27
00:01:11.695 --> 00:01:15.665
classify models as distribution
models or sample models,

28
00:01:15.665 --> 00:01:17.570
and identify when to use

29
00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.360
a distribution model
or sample model.

30
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.380
Models are used to store
knowledge about the dynamics.

31
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.740
When imagining different
scenarios to a decision-making,

32
00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.210
this is rooted in our knowledge

33
00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.220
about how the world works.

34
00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.575
From a particular
state in action,

35
00:01:33.575 --> 00:01:34.640
the model should produce

36
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.190
a possible next state and reward.

37
00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.710
This allows us to
see an outcome of

38
00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.800
an action without having
to actually take it.

39
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.170
A model allows for planning.

40
00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.210
Planning refers to the process of

41
00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.910
using a model to
improve a policy.

42
00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.070
One way to plan with a model

43
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.275
is to use simulated experience

44
00:01:54.275 --> 00:01:56.420
and perform value
function updates

45
00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.210
as if those experiences happened.

46
00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.625
By improving the value estimates,

47
00:02:01.625 --> 00:02:04.565
we can make more
informed decisions.

48
00:02:04.565 --> 00:02:07.970
Simulating experience improves
the sample efficiency.

49
00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.264
The addition of
simulated experience

50
00:02:10.264 --> 00:02:11.300
means the agent needs

51
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.845
fewer interactions with the world

52
00:02:12.845 --> 00:02:15.285
to come up with the same policy.

53
00:02:15.285 --> 00:02:17.540
Now, let's talk about
the different types of

54
00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.745
models that may be useful to us.

55
00:02:19.745 --> 00:02:21.620
One is a sample model,

56
00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.555
which produces an actual outcome

57
00:02:23.555 --> 00:02:26.405
drawn from some
underlying probabilities.

58
00:02:26.405 --> 00:02:29.210
For example, a sample
model for flipping

59
00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:33.110
a coin can generate a random
sequence of heads and tails.

60
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.060
Another type of model is

61
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.250
a distribution model
which completely

62
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.360
specifies the likelihood or
probability of every outcome.

63
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.605
In the coin flipping example,

64
00:02:43.605 --> 00:02:46.250
it would say that heads
could occur 50 percent of

65
00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.570
the time and that tails could

66
00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.610
occur 50 percent of the time.

67
00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.160
It could also produce
the odds of any sequence

68
00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.445
of heads and tails
using this information.

69
00:02:55.445 --> 00:02:59.330
Sample models can be
computationally inexpensive because

70
00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:00.830
random outcomes can be produced

71
00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.705
according to a set of rules.

72
00:03:02.705 --> 00:03:05.110
For example, to flip five coins,

73
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.490
a sample model can
randomly pick zero or

74
00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:10.115
one independently five times.

75
00:03:10.115 --> 00:03:14.030
It only needs to produce
a single outcome for each flip.

76
00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.380
As an example of a sample
model in practice, in 2017,

77
00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.650
the company CloudFlare use
random patterns sampled from

78
00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.495
a wall of lava lamps to encrypt

79
00:03:23.495 --> 00:03:25.915
10 percent of
global Internet traffic.

80
00:03:25.915 --> 00:03:28.370
The samples are
random configurations of

81
00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.560
the lava lamp wall
at a given point in

82
00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.410
time with the procedure
of rules to generate

83
00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.235
those samples defined by
the dynamics of the lava lamps.

84
00:03:37.235 --> 00:03:40.310
Distribution models
contain more information,

85
00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.170
but can be difficult to specify

86
00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.395
and can become very large.

87
00:03:44.395 --> 00:03:48.245
Let's go back to the example
for flipping five coins.

88
00:03:48.245 --> 00:03:50.510
A distribution model
would enumerate

89
00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.270
every possible sequence
of heads and tails you

90
00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:55.490
could get across
the five coins and

91
00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:58.165
assign a probability
to each sequence.

92
00:03:58.165 --> 00:04:00.070
For this simple problem,

93
00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:01.760
that would consist of fully

94
00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.000
describing 32 possible outcomes.

95
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.500
Distribution models can be

96
00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.285
used as sample models by drying

97
00:04:08.285 --> 00:04:09.380
outcomes according to

98
00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.870
explicit probabilities
of each outcome.

99
00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.510
But they contain
more information that might be

100
00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.555
strictly needed just
to obtain samples.

101
00:04:17.555 --> 00:04:20.960
In this video, we talked
about how models can be

102
00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:22.595
used to improve a policy

103
00:04:22.595 --> 00:04:24.380
through a process
called planning.

104
00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.900
We discussed two different
types of models,

105
00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.540
sample models and
distribution models.

106
00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.100
Next time, we'll go into

107
00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.640
more depth on the differences
between these models.
