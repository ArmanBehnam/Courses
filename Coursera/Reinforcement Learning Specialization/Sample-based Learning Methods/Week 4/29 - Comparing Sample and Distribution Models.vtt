00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.535
Models represent knowledge
of how the world works.

2
00:00:08.535 --> 00:00:10.470
We've talked about
two types of models;

3
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:12.975
sample models and
distribution models.

4
00:00:12.975 --> 00:00:14.610
In this video, we'll focus on

5
00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.590
a concrete example to illustrate

6
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.060
the key differences between

7
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.835
sample models and
distribution models.

8
00:00:20.835 --> 00:00:22.795
By the end of this video,

9
00:00:22.795 --> 00:00:25.430
you will be able to
describe the advantages and

10
00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.820
disadvantages of sample models
and distribution models,

11
00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.350
and you will also
be able to explain

12
00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:31.610
why sample models can be

13
00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.315
represented more compactly
than distribution models.

14
00:00:35.315 --> 00:00:38.990
Let's consider the problem
of rolling 12 dice.

15
00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:40.640
This can be done easily with

16
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.130
a single die and enough patients.

17
00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.440
Rolling a single die 12 times

18
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.720
is an example of a sample model.

19
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.970
Programatically,
one would generate

20
00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.570
a random number
from 1-6, 12 times.

21
00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.310
This is very compact and does

22
00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.465
not consider joint probabilities.

23
00:00:58.465 --> 00:01:01.160
Modelling the complete
joint distribution of

24
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.590
rolling 12 dice is
much more work.

25
00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.040
We must consider
every possible outcome of

26
00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.730
12 dice and assign
a probability to each outcome.

27
00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:13.740
With one die, we have six
outcomes with two dice,

28
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.675
we have 36 outcomes,

29
00:01:15.675 --> 00:01:21.180
three has 216, four has 1,296,

30
00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.345
and by the time we
get to 12 dice,

31
00:01:23.345 --> 00:01:26.635
we have over 2 billion possible
outcomes to consider.

32
00:01:26.635 --> 00:01:28.720
But it can be useful that

33
00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.280
a distribution model produces

34
00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.530
the exact probability
of an outcome.

35
00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.320
For example, we can compute
the expected outcome

36
00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.760
directly or quantify
the variability in outcomes.

37
00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.285
Let's summarize the benefits
of each type of model.

38
00:01:43.285 --> 00:01:45.980
Sample models
require less memory.

39
00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.420
Distribution models on

40
00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.160
the other hand can
be used to compute

41
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.560
the exact expected
outcome by summing

42
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.440
over all outcomes weighted
by their probabilities.

43
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.960
Note that sample models
can only approximate

44
00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.835
this expected outcome by
averaging many samples together,

45
00:02:00.835 --> 00:02:03.560
knowing the exact
probabilities also has

46
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.795
the flexibility of
assessing risk.

47
00:02:05.795 --> 00:02:09.080
For example, when a doctor
is prescribing medicine,

48
00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.270
they would consider
many possible side effects

49
00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.680
and how likely they are to occur.

50
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.970
In this video, we described
how sample models

51
00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.900
can be more compact than
distribution models,

52
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.280
and how the explicit
probabilities and

53
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.175
distribution models can be
useful in some situations,

54
00:02:25.175 --> 00:02:28.320
such as for computing
expectations.
