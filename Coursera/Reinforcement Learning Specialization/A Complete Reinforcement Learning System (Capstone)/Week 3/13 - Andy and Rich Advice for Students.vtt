00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:06.798
So back to risk seeking and risk aversion.

2
00:00:06.798 --> 00:00:13.033
My risk aversion has led me to look
at what people in the past have done,

3
00:00:13.033 --> 00:00:17.365
because I don't like to
risk someone saying,

4
00:00:17.365 --> 00:00:22.100
that's just this that we did 30 years ago.

5
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:30.100
And I'm sort of always driven
to prevent that from happening.

6
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.547
And so I look back.

7
00:00:33.547 --> 00:00:37.866
I become the historian of
the field to some extent,

8
00:00:37.866 --> 00:00:43.600
with Rich's help to, of course,
and that's what fascinates me.

9
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.616
I love how these things are connected and
this fabric,

10
00:00:47.616 --> 00:00:51.721
the dynamic programming and
control and prediction and

11
00:00:51.721 --> 00:00:56.800
all these things, not to mention
the psychology and neuroscience.

12
00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.400
I mean,
those kind of connections fascinate me.

13
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.041
So in that article in AI magazine,

14
00:01:03.041 --> 00:01:06.784
I repeated what I said at
the first RLDM meeting.

15
00:01:06.784 --> 00:01:10.599
I did an opening remarks,

16
00:01:10.599 --> 00:01:15.073
and I said if you reinvent the wheel, and

17
00:01:15.073 --> 00:01:19.559
there's a lot of wheel like stuff in RL.

18
00:01:19.559 --> 00:01:26.504
Call it a wheel or maybe an improved
wheel, rather than something different.

19
00:01:26.504 --> 00:01:31.575
Because that's what connects this field
to the whole body of, it's moving

20
00:01:31.575 --> 00:01:36.900
forward in terms of increasing one's
armament of algorithms and techniques.

21
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.230
Don't give it some name that
doesn't connect to anything.

22
00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.382
I wanted to ask you about this, and

23
00:01:45.382 --> 00:01:49.950
I mentioned how growing
up as a graduate student,

24
00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.171
you were an important influence on me and
the things I've

25
00:01:55.171 --> 00:02:00.198
learned from you and
still continue to learn from you.

26
00:02:00.198 --> 00:02:05.463
And one of the big things is
just scholarship has just,

27
00:02:05.463 --> 00:02:12.100
when I grew up with you and I wrote
things and you would tell me things,

28
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.700
you would call my,
you called it purple prose.

29
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.925
And I was just too effusive, and
you wanted to rein me in and

30
00:02:22.925 --> 00:02:29.678
make me more accurate and
more respectful of my predecessors.

31
00:02:29.678 --> 00:02:32.174
And this is something I think
I've learned from you and

32
00:02:32.174 --> 00:02:35.550
I'm now trying to pass it on to others,
scholarship and craftsmanship.

33
00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.968
I know you are also a carpenter.

34
00:02:37.968 --> 00:02:41.107
And I just wondered how you
you became this way, and

35
00:02:41.107 --> 00:02:46.000
how do you think about the craftsmanship
and scholarship of being a scientist.

36
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.200
Well, so your mom taught, right?

37
00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.047
>> Yeah, that's true.

38
00:02:52.047 --> 00:02:55.100
>> And I gave you a hard time
on the draft of your thesis.

39
00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:01.852
So he comes back with a stack of books
on writing this high on his desk and

40
00:03:01.852 --> 00:03:06.201
now he's an extremely good good writer,
and

41
00:03:06.201 --> 00:03:10.100
my students still complain about that.

42
00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.830
I mean, I can't read the, I can't-
>> They complain about me being

43
00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:13.500
a good writer?

44
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.197
>> No no, about me.

45
00:03:15.197 --> 00:03:17.414
You are an absolutely [CROSSTALK].

46
00:03:17.414 --> 00:03:20.227
>> [CROSSTALK] a good writer,
it's important.

47
00:03:20.227 --> 00:03:24.792
>> I can't focus on the technical
stuff unless the writing it

48
00:03:24.792 --> 00:03:29.000
takes to drive students nuts,
but they're better.

49
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:31.700
Well craftsmanship.

50
00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:38.200
Yeah, I guess I like I'm
a perfectionist in some sense and

51
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.782
Why the errors in the book but
you know, I like it.

52
00:03:43.782 --> 00:03:50.256
I like something to be a lasting thing
that I have to keep fooling with,

53
00:03:50.256 --> 00:03:55.196
you know finished product and
You Know Rich posted our

54
00:03:55.196 --> 00:04:00.712
graphs on the internet,
which I really didn't like that.

55
00:04:00.712 --> 00:04:02.600
It's yielded a lot of wonderful comment.

56
00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.204
So but like it's not perfect.

57
00:04:06.204 --> 00:04:07.500
You know, I don't want other people read.

58
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:13.400
Reading that so so rich, you know put
it all out there and that's fine.

59
00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:21.802
But I would have preferred to Spring
a perfect gone people at the end.

60
00:04:21.802 --> 00:04:26.592
I don't know I mean, so is it is it
risk aversion as well that leads to

61
00:04:26.592 --> 00:04:30.557
let me when I work with my hands and
building something.

62
00:04:30.557 --> 00:04:35.887
I you know,
I if I if there's a little mistake.

63
00:04:35.887 --> 00:04:40.963
If I don't fix it, Bob's me,
whenever I look at the product I

64
00:04:40.963 --> 00:04:46.139
could you know, anything,
you know years later others out but

65
00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:52.095
I think it's a very timely thing for
our field because there's a feeling

66
00:04:52.095 --> 00:04:57.100
that we wanted to move faster
because things are heating up.

67
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.100
And so there's this tension
between the desire to get

68
00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:08.500
Get done faster to get somewhere faster.

69
00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.400
And do something good.

70
00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.800
So we want lasting.
