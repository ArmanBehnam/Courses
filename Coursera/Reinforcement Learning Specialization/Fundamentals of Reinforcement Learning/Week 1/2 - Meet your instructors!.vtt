00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:08.490
Hi, I'm Martha.

2
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.520
I'm an Assistant Professor at
the University of Alberta.

3
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.490
Hi, I'm Adam. I'm
a Research Professor at

4
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.050
the University of Alberta and

5
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:18.265
a Senior Researcher at DeepMind.

6
00:00:18.265 --> 00:00:20.450
Adam is well known
for his work on

7
00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:22.625
predictive knowledge for
reinforcement learning.

8
00:00:22.625 --> 00:00:24.170
Several research groups around

9
00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.240
the world are building
on these ideas.

10
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.045
I personally think it is some
of the most important work

11
00:00:29.045 --> 00:00:32.330
in recent years and will only
become more influential.

12
00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.580
He's also an
impressive empiricist,

13
00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:35.720
a real master of designing

14
00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.150
experiments to cut
to the key issues.

15
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:39.710
He's constantly trying to improve

16
00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.740
scientific understanding
in the RL-Community.

17
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.050
Martha's algorithm
contributions to

18
00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.405
reinforcement learning are
too many to list here.

19
00:00:47.405 --> 00:00:49.115
She has developed several new

20
00:00:49.115 --> 00:00:50.904
off policy learning algorithms,

21
00:00:50.904 --> 00:00:52.840
new approaches to
policy gradient,

22
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.800
and dozens of
impressive contributions

23
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.180
to representation learning.

24
00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:57.920
She is truly one of the young

25
00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.900
rising stars in
reinforcement learning.

26
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.400
She also happens to be

27
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.160
my most frequent co-author
and my partner in life.

28
00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:08.320
So how did you get
into computer science?

29
00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.170
Well, I grew up in
the East Coast.

30
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.130
In high school, I was really
interested in the sciences;

31
00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.380
physics, chemistry, biology,

32
00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.270
but I couldn't really
find a right fit.

33
00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.550
So I randomly took a course on

34
00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.870
computer science and programming,
actually, in GW-BASIC.

35
00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.580
It was really just
a career defining

36
00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.590
moment for me because
I just remember

37
00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.050
the first time implementing

38
00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.355
an if statement or a for
loop and it was just

39
00:01:31.355 --> 00:01:32.870
amazing to me that I could get

40
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.745
a computer to execute a sequence
of instructions for me.

41
00:01:36.745 --> 00:01:38.880
So from there, there was no hope.

42
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.785
I was always going to do
computer science in college.

43
00:01:41.785 --> 00:01:43.760
Okay. Then from there, why did

44
00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.470
you start working on
reinforcement learning?

45
00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.560
So for graduate studies, I
moved out to Alberta and

46
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.579
I came out here to do
parallel distributed computing,

47
00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:53.915
that's what I focused
on in my undergrad.

48
00:01:53.915 --> 00:01:56.090
So I had all my courses loaded up

49
00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.855
with systems courses and I
had one more elected to fill,

50
00:01:59.855 --> 00:02:02.090
and so I was looking around
for a course to take.

51
00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:03.800
I did a very reasonable strategy,

52
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.840
I looked at the pictures of

53
00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:06.940
the professors and I picked

54
00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.150
the friendliest looking
professor I could find.

55
00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:11.240
Yeah, that turned out
to be Rich Sutton and

56
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.615
it was introduction to
reinforcement learning.

57
00:02:13.615 --> 00:02:16.130
That course was amazing.
It was really inspiring.

58
00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.705
It was my first introduction to

59
00:02:17.705 --> 00:02:20.565
artificial intelligence or
machine learning of any kind.

60
00:02:20.565 --> 00:02:22.040
So I remember one of the early

61
00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.060
assignments in that course,

62
00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.610
we were implementing
SARSA to do a grid world.

63
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.280
Again, it was another career
defining moment for me

64
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.475
just watching this agent
learn to solve this maze.

65
00:02:31.475 --> 00:02:34.670
All it got was this reward
signal minus one per step.

66
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:35.990
Somehow it figured out this

67
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.105
amazingly efficient path
through the maze.

68
00:02:38.105 --> 00:02:40.790
Again, it just amaze me and I

69
00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:41.990
was hooked and I
was going to keep

70
00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.135
doing that for
the rest of my life.

71
00:02:44.135 --> 00:02:46.610
So Martha, how did you
end up doing research

72
00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.605
in machine learning and
artificial intelligence?

73
00:02:48.605 --> 00:02:51.460
Well, I actually started
my undergrad in math.

74
00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.360
I've always thought functions and

75
00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.250
dynamical systems are beautiful.

76
00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.305
Then I just took
a CS course for fun,

77
00:02:57.305 --> 00:02:58.550
and it really was very fun.

78
00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.490
So I just continued
in both math and CS.

79
00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.440
Those two topics go
really well together

80
00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.240
for AI and machine
learning, actually.

81
00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.580
So and then I did
some research in AI

82
00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.280
in the summertime and just
continued from there.

83
00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.490
I really just stayed in
the field because over time,

84
00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.190
our lives was more than just
about functions in math.

85
00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.110
It's really a community
where you get to collaborate

86
00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.125
a lot and you get to make
a career where you help people.

87
00:03:21.125 --> 00:03:24.260
So my day, I get to
mentor a lot and I get to

88
00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.200
work at a big team
working on hard problems,

89
00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.700
and it's really just
very amazing to get to

90
00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.000
work on such interesting
questions in a team.

91
00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.170
So there's probably
some people who are taking

92
00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:37.490
this RL course
because they want to

93
00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:38.960
do graduate studies in RL.

94
00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.490
So what's one of
the most important things

95
00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:42.010
you learn in
your graduate studies?

96
00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.090
Well maybe surprisingly enough,

97
00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:45.560
I learned a lesson that's useful

98
00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.690
across probably all the
sciences and in fact,

99
00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.565
just any form of research,

100
00:03:49.565 --> 00:03:51.095
and that's to really love

101
00:03:51.095 --> 00:03:52.940
coming to understand
the details of things,

102
00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.130
to focus and do

103
00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.205
small problems and understand
them really, really well.

104
00:03:58.205 --> 00:04:01.280
That's something that I think
is really applicable across

105
00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.050
a wide range of things
and it's something that I

106
00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:05.060
pass on to my students
in my classes,

107
00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.135
and I really focus on teaching
my graduate students that.

108
00:04:08.135 --> 00:04:09.860
It's something that
I hope to share to

109
00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.460
the people taking
this specialization.

110
00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.970
So what do you like
about your job?

111
00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.720
Well, I love doing research,

112
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.380
but sometimes that can grind
you down a little bit.

113
00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.245
Like it's really long hours,

114
00:04:21.245 --> 00:04:24.490
the peer review process can
be a little frustrating.

115
00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.520
So in those times when

116
00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.170
you step back and look
at your research,

117
00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:30.350
it can seem small and a

118
00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:31.370
little bit insignificant and

119
00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:32.840
it's hard to see
where that's going,

120
00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.100
how that's going to
impact the world

121
00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:35.495
and make it a better place.

122
00:04:35.495 --> 00:04:36.965
So in those times,

123
00:04:36.965 --> 00:04:38.780
you can always fall
back and think

124
00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.710
about teaching and mentorship.

125
00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.350
Teaching is where you get to

126
00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.750
help people learn about
things for the first time,

127
00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.940
to come to understand how

128
00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.280
your field works and
it's just so exciting.

129
00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.040
You're also being part of
the beginning of their careers,

130
00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.620
whether they end up in
academia, or industry,

131
00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.270
or starting their own companies,

132
00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.670
it's just such an
amazing experience

133
00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:00.830
to be part of that process.

134
00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.770
Throughout my week,
the best day for

135
00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.440
me is always the days
when my schedule is full

136
00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:07.520
of meetings with my students and

137
00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:08.660
I get to help them work on

138
00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:10.360
their problems and understand

139
00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.220
reinforcement learning better.

140
00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.240
So why do you think
it's so important

141
00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.950
to work on
reinforcement learning?

142
00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:18.110
Well, I think the promise
of RL is really

143
00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.975
big but there are still
a lot of open challenges.

144
00:05:20.975 --> 00:05:23.510
Machine learning has started
being used much more widely,

145
00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:26.935
but RL has only been
used in a few areas.

146
00:05:26.935 --> 00:05:28.775
But at the same time, I think RL

147
00:05:28.775 --> 00:05:30.140
can have a really big impact.

148
00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.300
I think within
the next decade or so,

149
00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.760
we're going to see
more control engineers actually

150
00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.820
using RL in their systems.

151
00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.280
We're really just going to
see that it's a tool that

152
00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.920
can help in automated
decision-making,

153
00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.485
really within a larger
engineered systems.

154
00:05:45.485 --> 00:05:47.270
But I think for that
to really happen,

155
00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:49.040
we need to make
some advances in RL.

156
00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.180
We need to start thinking

157
00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:51.470
more about how
we're going to have

158
00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:53.450
robust algorithms and
how we're going to get

159
00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:55.850
people to be comfortable
using these algorithms.

160
00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:58.910
So I think alongside
adoption in industry,

161
00:05:58.910 --> 00:05:59.930
we're going to need
to be thinking about

162
00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:01.430
how we can improve

163
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:02.570
RL algorithms so that

164
00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:04.765
these two things can
happen together.

165
00:06:04.765 --> 00:06:08.895
So how about you? Why do you
think RL is good to work on?

166
00:06:08.895 --> 00:06:11.120
Well naturally, I think
reinforcement learning

167
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.650
is just the exact right framework

168
00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:16.400
to study AI and to make
progress towards solving AI.

169
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.100
But RL is also really
important to me

170
00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:20.210
because I'm very interested

171
00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:21.410
in developmental learning system.

172
00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:24.230
So you can think about humans,

173
00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:26.030
babies playing on the floor or

174
00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:28.805
young animals learning
about the world.

175
00:06:28.805 --> 00:06:32.095
I want to learn about
those systems and how they work.

176
00:06:32.095 --> 00:06:34.060
If you think about those systems,

177
00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:35.570
they learn an enormous amount in

178
00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:37.700
such a tiny amount of time.

179
00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:39.620
They learn how to crawl,

180
00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:41.480
they learn how their bodies work,

181
00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:42.650
they learn how to interact with

182
00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:44.600
their environment and
manipulate objects,

183
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.610
communicate with
other agents in the world.

184
00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:50.375
Just generally, they're
very competent learning systems.

185
00:06:50.375 --> 00:06:52.250
They do that over a couple

186
00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:53.600
of weeks to a couple of months.

187
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.430
It's just really astounding.

188
00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:57.680
It feels like we
have so much work

189
00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.690
to do to get close
to those systems.

190
00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:01.520
So I really want to
come to understand

191
00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.230
the algorithms and
the representations

192
00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:04.745
that those systems
might be using,

193
00:07:04.745 --> 00:07:06.860
and I think reinforcement
learning is the right lens to

194
00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:07.910
look at those things and to

195
00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:10.225
come to understand those things.

196
00:07:10.225 --> 00:07:13.040
So applications always drive

197
00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:14.600
interest and excitement
in the field

198
00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.010
and we've had a few of them in

199
00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:18.170
games and in some
industrial control problems.

200
00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:19.430
But what do you think
is going to be the next

201
00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:21.175
big thing in
reinforcement learning?

202
00:07:21.175 --> 00:07:23.310
Well, it's hard. I think RL is

203
00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:26.270
a general approach to
automated decision-making.

204
00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:28.610
It's a tool that's going to help

205
00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:30.785
us in a lot of
our engineered systems.

206
00:07:30.785 --> 00:07:32.930
So I think the place
we're really going to see

207
00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:35.420
it take off is an
industrial control.

208
00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:37.010
In industrial control, we have

209
00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:38.930
experts that are really
looking for ways to

210
00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:43.025
improve the optimal- how
well their systems work.

211
00:07:43.025 --> 00:07:44.600
So we're going to
see it do things

212
00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.205
like reduce energy costs

213
00:07:46.205 --> 00:07:48.710
or save on other types

214
00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:49.730
of costs that we have in

215
00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:51.200
these industrial control systems.

216
00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:52.280
In the hands of experts,

217
00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:53.510
we can really make
these algorithms

218
00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:55.190
work well in the near future.

219
00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:57.125
So I really see it as
a tool that's going to

220
00:07:57.125 --> 00:08:00.555
facilitate experts in
their work rather than say,

221
00:08:00.555 --> 00:08:01.640
doing something like replacing

222
00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:03.870
people or automating them away.
